"Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter@awzurcheron Twitter One was a decorated Iraq War veteran who was born in Ukraine and came to the US as a child, Lt Col Alexander Vindman. The other was US Vice-President Mike Pence's top adviser on Russia, Jennifer Williams. With the TV cameras rolling on Capitol Hill, they repeated concerns they had aired behind closed doors about the July phone call between the two leaders. But much of Tuesday's hearing was spent talking about a person who was probably not even in the room - the whistleblower. Here are my takeaways. 'I do not know who the whistleblower is' Did Alexander Vindman talk to the whistleblower about Trump's 25 July phone call with Ukraine's president? That certainly seems to be what Republican Devin Nunes believes. After a few questions about Hunter Biden and Ukraine, Nunes started asking the two witnesses about whether they spoke to the press about the now famous Trump phone call. He started with Jennifer Williams, who said she did not, but that was just a feint. The real fireworks came when Vindman spoke of the two people he talked to. The first was George Kent, the senior State Department Ukraine expert who had himself testified before the committee last week. The other was... an intelligence community official. For those who haven't been following closely, it has been widely reported that the whistleblower - the individual whose complaint set off the chain reaction that has led to these impeachment hearings - was a member of the intelligence community. When Democrat Adam Schiff cut in, saying ""these proceedings will not be used to out the whistleblower"", the audience let out an audible ""oooh"". But Vindman has testified that he doesn't know who the whistleblower is, Nunes responded, so how could he out that person? Things got tense. When Nunes referred to Vindman as ""Mr"", the Army officer curtly corrected him that it he should be addressed as ""Lieutenant Colonel Vindman"". Despite being pressed, Vindman and his lawyer dug in. He would not name names. Democrats have asserted that the impeachment investigation has become much bigger than the whistleblower, whose original complaint has been largely corroborated and whose identity is protected under federal law. Republicans - from the president on down - return time and time again to the whistleblower's identity, however, and what motivations he may have had to file his complaint. They may believe that if they undercut that person's credibility, the rest of the allegations will be treated with greater scepticism. Body language In his Wednesday morning testimony, Vindman spoke of a 10 July White House meeting with Ukrainian officials where Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU, twice brought up announcing investigations in exchange for a White House visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The first time, he says, National Security Advisor John Bolton abruptly cut the meeting short. Vindman testified that after a brief photo session, Sondland once again spoke of investigations of the Bidens, Ukrainian energy company Burisma and alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Other Democratic questioning attempted to place Donald Trump's 25 July phone call with Zelensky, to which Vindman also was a first-hand witness, within the context of Sondland's Ukrainian efforts. Vindman testified that it seemed like Zelensky was ""prepped"" for Trump's ask for a Biden investigation. They suggested that the 10 July Sondland activity was exactly that kind of prepping. If what Vindman said was important, how he said it in the public hearings also mattered. Behind closed doors, veteran ambassadors Bill Taylor and Marie Yovanovitch were reportedly smooth while Vindman was halting and nervous. Those observations have been confirmed by their public testimony. When Vindman delivered his opening statement, a few yards from where I was seated, his hands trembled slightly. He occasionally stumbled over his words. Republicans could paint that as weakness or uncertainty, but it might also be seen by Americans as giving his testimony a touch of humanity - particularly when paired with the emotional closing words to Vindman's opening statement. Vindman offered reassurance to his father, who brought his children to the US from the Soviet Union 40 years ago, that he was sitting in the US Capitol and would be ""fine for telling the truth"". Toward the end of Vindman's appearance, he was asked by a Democratic congressman to read that line again - and then added why he's not afraid of testifying today. ""Because this is America,"" he said. ""This is the country I have served and defended... and here, right matters."" A smattering of applause broke out from supporters in the hearing-room audience. But Vindman's testimony will only add to the contentious debate among Democrats and Republicans over who is right and exactly what the truth is. Did Republican witnesses help Democrats more? Later on Tuesday, the lawmakers heard from former National Security Council official Tim Morrison and US ex-special to Ukraine Kurt Volker. They had been listed as two men Republicans wanted to talk to during the public impeachment hearings. It turns out they hurt Donald Trump's defence as much as they helped it. Morrison did say there was nothing illegal or concerning about Donald Trump's 25 July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and no ill motive for moving the rough transcript of that call to a more secure government server. He also, however, corroborated reports that US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland pressured Ukraine to open investigations that could prove politically helpful to Donald Trump - and that Sondland was in regular contact with the president. Volker said he recalled past instances where the US had held up aid to a foreign nation and saw no evidence of bribery in this case, but he also turned out to be a character witness for Joe Biden. Not only did he assert that there was nothing untoward about the former vice-president's dealings with Ukraine, but he expressed dismay to learn that when Trump administration officials were calling for investigations into Ukrainian energy company Burisma, they were really looking to damage the Democratic presidential hopeful. That, and his acknowledgement that military aid may have been held up to increase the pressure on Ukraine, represented a change from Volker's closed-door testimony - given as one of the investigation's first witnesses. Democrats may suspect that Volker's new assertion is convenient naiveté or intentional obliviousness to avoid culpability, but it means his testimony still was of relatively little use for Republicans. Now the stage is set for Wednesday's appearance by Sondland - a man whose name came up throughout the day on Tuesday. The ambassador has already had to revise earlier sworn testimony to reflect memories he said were refreshed by other witnesses. He'll be further pressed by both Democrats and Republicans in what could be the most unpredictable appearance of any of the witnesses so far. Republican Congressman Mark Meadows of North Carolina, one of the president's most ardent defenders, calls Sondland a ""wild card"". Tomorrow we may have a better idea which side has a winning hand. Learn more about Trump and impeachment inquiry Opposing narratives For Americans watching the impeachment hearings, it often seemed as though the Democrats and Republicans weren't just talking across each other, they're not even existing in the same political universe. That divergence of realities was on stark display from the start of Tuesday's proceedings, as Democrat Adam Schiff and Republican Devin Nunes gave their opening remarks. As he had in the previous two days of hearings, Schiff used his time to lay out what he views as the case against Donald Trump. He described the president's alleged ""scheme"" to pressure the Ukrainian government to open investigations of Democrats that could be politically beneficial to him. He noted witness testimony of instances of this Ukrainian pressure. He cited Saturday's closed door deposition by US Ukraine-based diplomat David Holmes, who said he overheard a call during which Trump asked US Ambassador to EU Gordon Sondland about the ""investigations"". Sondland, Holmes said, would later observe that the president didn't care about Ukraine beyond how the investigations could help him personally. Nunes, in his five-minute statement, declined to offer a line-by-line defence of the president. Instead, he went on the attack. He said media coverage of last week's impeachment hearings were biased in favour of the Democrats. He called out CNN, the Guardian, Slate, the Daily Beast, New York magazine and others by name. He said their coverage of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election was frequently wrong, and the Ukraine story was simply a continuation of a campaign to oust the president. Democrats, in these hearings, are trying to set out a series of facts that they say point to presidential abuse of power and could constitute an impeachable offence. The Republican strategy, at least at this point, is to encourage Americans that they can't trust the facts - or the mainstream media outlets that are reporting them.","On day three of public hearings in the impeachment inquiry, the witnesses included top aides who listened in on President Trump's call with Ukraine's leader. What did we learn?"
"It made a net profit of $281m (£185m) in the three months to 15 June, a 15% drop from a year earlier. Sales in China fell 20% during the period amid fears of bird flu outbreak. The fears over the flu came as Yum was trying to recover from allegations that its suppliers were giving chickens with unapproved levels of antibiotics. Yum said that the ""residual effect"" of those allegations, first raised in December, had also impacted sales during the period. However, it added that its sales in China were showing signs of a recovery as the extensive media coverage surrounding Avian flu had subsided. The firm said sales in China declined 10% in June, from a year earlier, compared with a 19% drop in May. It said that it expects sales in the country to start rising by the fourth quarter. China is a key market for Yum, generating more than half the company's revenue, and the firm said it was committed to expanding its presence in the country. ""For the total China Division, we remain on track to open at least 700 new units this year. This means we will have opened about 1,600 units over a two-year period,"" David Novak, chief executive of Yum said in a statement. ""As KFC sales continue to recover, we expect to have solid momentum in China heading into 2014,"" he added. The company confirmed that is expects a sharp drop in profits this year, but added that it expected a ""big bounce-back"" in 2014.","Yum Brands, owner of KFC and Pizza Hut restaurant chains, has reported a drop in profits as a food safety scare continued to hurt its sales in China."
"Police sources told local media that the boy had refused to do his homework and was hit with a broom handle. The boy's elder brother, sister and stepsister were all present at the time of the incident. Although his mother was not there, she too has been arrested and was aware of what was going on, reports say. The boy's death in September prompted a vigil in the centre of Mulhouse among residents who rallied round his parents. But the family's initial accounts of what had happened and the ensuing post-mortem examination prompted police to continue their investigation. Bruises were discovered on the boy's body, particularly on his feet, according to Alsace website DNA. Although he had suffered a cardiac arrest, pathologists said the cause of death had been the blows he had suffered, DNA reported. A police source was quoted as saying he had been struck by blunt objects. The boy's mother had been away from home on a business trip but had actively encouraged his punishment because he did not want to do his homework, French media said. The four members of the family were being held in custody in Mulhouse on Thursday and were due to appear before the local prosecutor ahead of a judicial investigation. Although the 19-year-old elder brother is suspected of carrying out the killing, an investigating judge will try to shed further light on the tragedy. The boy's death comes at a time when France's National Assembly is about to consider a ban on smacking. The two proposals are for children to be entitled to an education free of violence, and for those in parental authority to be banned from using ""means of humiliation such as physical or verbal violence, corporal punishment and moral abuse"".",Four members of the same family have been arrested after a nine-year-old boy was beaten to death at his home in the eastern French city of Mulhouse.
"Zelda Perkins told the Financial Times she signed a non-disclosure agreement in 1998 after making the accusations. She said he asked her to give him massages and tried to pull her into bed, but she ""was made to feel ashamed for disclosing his behaviour"". Weinstein has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex ""unequivocally"". The former assistant said she reported her allegations after a female colleague told her she had also been sexually harassed by the film producer. The two women subsequently sought damages and were awarded a sum of £250,000 ($330,500), split equally, but also signed a non-disclosure agreement, prohibiting them from discussing the allegations. By breaking the agreement, Ms Perkins could be liable to repay the settlement, and potentially pay damages and other legal fees stipulated in the contract. However, she told the Financial Times: ""I want to publicly break my non-disclosure agreement. ""Unless somebody does this there won't be a debate about how egregious these agreements are and the amount of duress that victims are put under."" She claims that the film executive would ask her to massage him while he was in his underwear, when they were alone in hotel rooms. Her testimony is similar to that of a number of Hollywood actresses - Lupita Nyong'o and Gwyneth Paltrow both claimed Weinstein suggested a massage in his bedroom and hotel room respectively. Ms Perkins added that she often had to wake him up in the morning and ""he would try to pull me into bed"". Weinstein has apologised for the way he has ""behaved with colleagues in the past"" and acknowledged that his actions have ""caused a lot of pain"". However, he has said many of the accusations against him are ""patently false"", and in a statement to the FT, said he had ""confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances"". Ms Perkins is one of scores of accusers who have come forward after a New York Times investigation into Weinstein's conduct. Actress Rose McGowan claimed that she reached a $100,000 (£84,000) settlement with Weinstein in 1997 after an alleged incident in a hotel room at the Sundance Film Festival. The New York Times said a legal document confirming the settlement stipulated it was ""not to be construed as an admission"", but intended to ""avoid litigation and buy peace"". Allegations against the 65-year-old are subject to criminal investigations in London, Los Angeles and New York. He is also under civil rights investigation in New York state.

"By Matthew DaviesAfrica Business Report editor, Johannesburg But with Nigeria pulling out, questions are being raised over just how achievable it really is. The vision is a free trade deal encompassing 1.2 billion people stretching from Cape Town to Cairo. Goods, services and perhaps labour, flowing freely in and out of more than 50 African countries. It could create tens of thousands of jobs and significantly reduce unemployment among the continent's youthful population. It'll boost trade between African countries and would be instrumental in moving the whole continent away from the narrative of simply being a place where the powerhouse economies of the West and East come to get their raw materials. Fears Many African governments, naturally, are keen. So, expect lots of fanfare when African leaders gather in the Rwandan capital, Kigali this week to sign the agreement. The South African department of trade and industry says it's ""committed to a co-ordinated strategy to boost intra-Africa trade and to build an integrated market in Africa that will see a market of over a billion people with a GDP of approximately $2.6 trillion (£1.85tn) "". And Kenya's trade ministry says it'll not only create a massive liberalised market, but will also ""enhance competitiveness at the industry and enterprise level, enhance value addition of products and exploit economies of scale and optimum utilization of resource"". But the deal has already hit its first hurdle, before it's even been signed. Nigeria announced at the weekend that President Muhammadu Buhari will not attend the ceremony in Kigali. In a statement, the Nigerian government said that ""certain key stakeholders in Nigeria indicated that they had not been consulted, for which reasons they had some concerns on the provisions of the treaty"". Those key stakeholders are both Nigeria's business community and its trade unions. The trade unions are thought to be particularly concerned about a free trade area, given that it could develop into a much more integrated body, which would see the free movement of workers across borders, providing a possible threat to Nigerian jobs. The fact that Africa's largest economy won't be at the launch has placed a dampener on proceedings and a question mark over the entire project's viability. Even if all parties do eventually agree to sign a free trade treaty, that is simply where the real work begins. After the ink dries and the officials have all gone home, how quickly can such an agreement to put into practice? When will it make a difference on the ground? Until a business can move its goods from any country in the Free Trade Area to any another almost as if borders don't exist the proclamations on paper will count for very little. Under a free trade area agreement, all the African signatory countries would have to agree to reduce the trade tariffs and import quotas between each other and boost intra-African trade. Generally speaking, it's the first stage of closer economic co-operation with a view to possible integration. The next stage would be a customs union, where each country would have the same tariffs with the outside world and low or no tariffs between each other. Then comes a common market, where goods, services and labour move tariff and quota-free between the countries and the bloc has a common trade relationship with the rest of the globe. Further integration involves political union and a unifying single currency. A big ask All of this took the European Union more than 50 years to establish following the Second World War. Some integration already exists in Africa - the East African Community and the Southern Africa Customs Union are examples. But for a continent-wide free trade area to really work there has to be significantly more cross-border trade within Africa. This is currently a challenge, as most African countries tend to trade more with the outside world than they do with their fellow African states. Indeed, intra-African trade accounts for about 16% of the total - in Asia that figure is 51% and in Europe it rises to 70%. Another challenge is the sheer size of Africa - not just geographically, but also in terms of the number of countries that need to sign up and ratify the free trade area agreement. When the European integration process started in the early 1950s, just six countries were involved. More than 60 years later, the European Union has 28 members. Africa has 54 countries. So, implementation and co-ordination are key. For a start, the parliaments of the all the countries need to ratify it. How long those political wheels take to turn is anybody's guess. The African Free Trade Area is a big task and, in a way, a big ask. But if it's the first tentative steps toward greater economic ties and trade within Africa, the continent's citizens will feel its benefits. How quickly that happens depends on the enduring enthusiasm, focus and determination of the leaders who pen the deal.",The European Union and its free trade agreement took decades to establish. Africa is now hoping it can achieve the same in a fraction of the time.
"He has frequently expressed his dislike of social media sites - including YouTube and Facebook - believing they are being used to attack him. However, the Twitter ban has drawn widespread criticism, including from Turkish President Abdullah Gul who tweeted his disagreement. But Mr Erdogan's troubles go far beyond social media. He is also facing allegations of corruption and is embroiled in a feud with a former ally. Here's a look at some of the battles he is currently fighting. Why is Mr Erdogan banning Twitter? Last month, an audio recording posted on an anonymous Twitter account appeared to show Mr Erdogan talking to his son about hiding large sums of money. Mr Erdogan denounced it as a fake. ""I don't care what the international community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic,"" Mr Erdogan said on Thursday. However, millions of Turkish internet users continued to access Twitter, using proxy servers and other means. Twitter itself posted instructions, while in Istanbul, graffiti appeared with details of how to sidestep the ban. Many of the prime minister's harshest critics have used Twitter to co-ordinate protests against him and circulate damaging information. A law passed last month tightens government controls on the internet, allowing the Turkish authorities to block websites without first seeking a court ruling. It will also force internet providers to store data on web users' activities for two years and make it available to the authorities. The opposition and human rights organisations have criticised the move as an assault on freedom of expression. The BBC also expressed concern after a reporter for BBC Turkish was attacked on social media by the mayor of Ankara. Protesters and politicians defy Turkey's Twitter ban Turkey tightens internet controls BBC reporters 'intimidated' by Turkey The recorded phone call posted on Twitter appears to show Mr Erdogan asking his son Bilal to dispose of millions of euros in cash from a house. Mr Erdogan says the allegations are a plot by his enemies to oust him. In December, three Turkish government ministers resigned after their sons were taken into custody by police investigating allegations of bribery for construction projects. All three sons were later released. One of the ministers later said a great number of the construction projects had been approved by Mr Erdogan himself and he called on the prime minister to resign. Erdogan's private phone call goes viral Turkish ministers resign amid scandal Once an ally of Mr Erdogan, Fethullah Gulen is an Islamic scholar who founded an influential social and cultural network which now includes more than 900 schools in Turkey. Mr Gulen himself has lived in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999. Followers of his Hizmet movement - whose name means ""service"" - are said to hold senior positions in the Turkish police, the judiciary and Mr Erdogan's AK Party itself. However, Mr Gulen's critics believe Hizmet's aim is to gain power, to spread socially conservative Islamic attitudes on issues like marriage and alcohol around the globe, and to suppress any opposition. Mr Erdogan has accused him of running a ""state within a state"" - an accusation he denies. In December, Turkish pro-government media claimed prosecutors with ties to Mr Gulen had illegally wiretapped thousands of prominent figures. Targets reportedly included government ministers and business leaders. The claims were published a few hours ahead of the leaked recording said to be of Mr Erdogan. Profile: Fethullah Gulen's Hizmet movement Turkey prosecutors 'tapped phones' The anger which led to last year's protests flared up again recently, with the news of the death of a 15-year-old boy who had been in a coma since last June. Berkin Elvan was on his way to buy bread when he was hit on the head by a tear gas canister fired by police. Mr Erdogan said the boy had links to ""terrorist organisations"". His death brought the toll from last year's unrest to at least eight, including one policeman. The protests began over plans to develop Istanbul's Gezi Park into a new mosque and shopping centre, but escalated into national demonstrations against what opponents see as Mr Erdogan's growing authoritarianism. Erdogan and the 'foreign plot' Erdogan accuses boy of 'terrorist links' For many years, Mr Erdogan was held up as the role model for the leaders of Muslim countries, at ease with democracy and a pluralistic society. He has now been in power for 11 years. His critics say he is becoming increasingly autocratic. Turkey is a member of Nato and is formally a candidate to join the European Union. European Commission Vice-President Neelie Kroes took to Twitter to voice her disappointment at the Twitter ban: ""The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is."" The German government also criticised the ban, as did the US-based research and pressure group Human Rights Watch, which called it a ""fundamental blow to freedom of expression"". Mr Erdogan is likely to shrug off criticism from his foreign critics. But local elections are due to take place on 30 March, and the Turkish prime minister will have no choice but to listen to the voters' verdict.","Turkey has blocked the social networking site Twitter following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow to ""wipe out"" the service."
"Nick TriggleHealth correspondent A hundred years ago, infectious diseases were the scourge of the nation. As the 1800s drew to a close, more than a third of all deaths were caused by the likes of small pox, measles, cholera, tuberculosis and diphtheria. Now, thanks to medical advances - and vaccines in particular - the burden of infectious illnesses has been reduced significantly. Smallpox has been eradicated. This has, in turn, had a huge impact on life expectancy. Before World War One, nearly two thirds of deaths were among the under-60s. Now only one in 10 is. But as the population has aged, there has been a rapid growth in chronic conditions. Half of all deaths are now linked to circulatory problems - like heart disease - and cancers. This has had major implications for the way the NHS works, with an estimated 70% of the budget spent on long-term conditions like these. Only this week, Maureen Baker, president of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the growing pressures on doctors - a key theme of the election campaign - were partly a result of the growth in such diseases, which had meant GPs having to provide care that was once the preserve of ""hospital consultants"". So what will happen next? Clearly predictions are hard to make. For example, shortly after the smallpox breakthrough, a completely new threat emerged that no-one could have foreseen. It was HIV. The big unknown in today's world is the threat from drug resistance. Chief medical officer Prof Sally Davies has talked of an ""apocalyptic"" situation where people could die of what are currently routine infections because of the lack of effective antibiotics. Other potential scenarios linked to climate change have been put forward. Perhaps the most eye-catching was a recent warning that tropical diseases could take hold. Experts wrote in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal this year that warmer UK temperatures could make conditions favourable for mosquitoes to breed, opening the door to conditions such as dengue fever and West Nile virus in the next few decades. But while such developments need to be guarded against, probably the best indication of what is around the corner comes from the World Health Organization's Global Burden of Disease research programme. It has been tracking the changing patterns of illness since 1990 and also makes predictions - as the table below shows. (It is worth noting that different types of cancers are listed separately.) Perhaps the most noticeable change is the way that dementia has climbed up the table. The ageing population means the number of cases is growing all the time - and there is evidence that the NHS is already struggling to keep up. Years of poor health A report last year by the Alzheimer's Society found that only a third of the care that patients needed was provided by the state (the NHS or councils) with the rest coming from support from family and friends or from services they paid for. The charity branded it a ""dementia tax"" and called for an overhaul in how services were organised. But the changing patterns of disease pose another dilemma - a growing burden of ill health. Whereas infectious diseases tended to claim lives quickly, chronic illness can lead to many years of poor health. Research by Public Health England has shown that while life expectancy has grown over the past 20 years, healthy life expectancy has not increased so quickly - with the UK now seeing levels of ill health above those of other developed countries. A major cause is how people live their lives, with smoking highlighted as the biggest factor, followed by being overweight and then lack of activity and diet. The result is that the average person spends more than a fifth of their life in poor health, according to the Office for National Statistics. The warning is clear: if something is not done, ill health could well join death and taxes as a guarantee in life.","There are few things guaranteed in life. Death - along with taxes, as the saying goes - is one of them. But what we die of has and is continuing to change."
"The body of Linda Smith, 12, was found in a field near Hadleigh on 20 January 1961, four days after she went missing. Det Ch Insp Andy Smith said the case was being ""fully and extensively"" reviewed and there was ""every reason"" to believe the killer was still alive. ""Time is running out for them to do the right thing,"" he said. Her death is the oldest of about 13 unsolved murders being regularly reviewed by Suffolk Police. Linda, who lived in Earls Colne, near Halstead in Essex, was last seen walking to a shop in the village to buy a magazine for her great-grandmother. Forensic advances Hundreds of people helped search the surrounding area before her clothed body was found in a field in Polstead in Suffolk, about 14 miles (22km) from Earls Colne.

""I would appeal to witnesses, particularly those with allegiances which may have changed over the years, to also examine their consciences.""

"By Owen AmosBBC News, Singapore Askren was a rising star - state wrestling champion; national wrestling champion; Olympian; and, at that point, undefeated mixed martial artist. He had 19 wins in 19 fights. And then fight 20 started. His opponent, Jorge Masvidal, ran forward and leapt. Askren ducked; Masvidal's knee smashed into his head. Askren was out cold. The fight was over, five seconds after it started. In the 23-year history of the Ultimate Fighting Championship - the Premier League of mixed martial arts - it was the quickest knockout. Within minutes, the clip was seen millions of times online. But for Askren - the unwitting, unconscious, co-star of the show - what happened next? Askren's next memory, he tells the BBC, is from the hospital, after he came round, when he began piecing together those five seconds. ""It was like, OK, I'm in the hospital. OK, I lost. Then it's like - I'm not that sore or sweaty, so it probably didn't take very long. My wife was there, so I said 'Amy - tell me what happened'."" And did she? ""Yeah she did,"" he says, laughing. ""She was like - 'Yeah, it didn't go so well...'"" Askren wasn't badly injured, so after the fight he went on Twitter - the platform where his loss looped over and over - to sum up his feelings. It was short, sweet and self-deprecating. ""Well that sucked,"" he said. That honesty got Askren 30,000 retweets, 200,000 likes and an army of admirers. He also went on Ariel Helwani's MMA Show, a popular programme, and in general - well - took it on the chin. ""It's just better that way,"" he tells the BBC, sitting barefoot on a Singapore hotel sofa. ""You get it out there. It happened. It's not like you can change it, and plaster over it, and make people not see it. You accept it."" Other fighters might have closed the curtains, hidden away... ""Or made a lot of excuses,"" Askren finishes. To work out why he didn't, it's worth looking at what happened before the Masvidal fight, as well as what happened next. Askren grew up in Hartland, Wisconsin, in the US mid-west. He played a number of sports - baseball, soccer, (American) football - and began wrestling when he was five. When did he realise he was good? ""Well, I sucked for a while,"" he says, honest as ever. ""I was terrible. I don't think there was a realisation that I was good - it was a realisation I wanted to be better."" Getting better happened quickly. At high school he was twice state champion, and won a national championship too. But there was never a satisfaction; never a victory parade. Even when he won the National Collegiate Athletic Association titles in 2006 and 2007, his focus moved forward. ""When I won the national titles in college I was like, OK, this is awesome, it was a lifelong dream,"" he says. ""But then I've got to make the Olympic team in a year? How do I do that?"" He did make the Olympic team, but was knocked out in 2008 without winning a medal. When asked which hurt more - the Olympics or Masvidal - his reaction to the five-second fight makes more sense. ""The Olympics was way worse,"" he says, without a second's thought. ""That was a dream for 10-plus years, something I chased after my whole life. Then obviously in the one instant it's gone. ""With this [UFC], I could [win two fights] and I'm right back. We're talking within nine months, I could be right back to the same place I was, maybe faster."" What is UFC? Askren's comeback starts on Saturday night in Singapore, when he takes on the Brazilian Demian Maia in the main event of UFC Fight Night. Has the Masvidal fight made him more scared, more nervous? ""No, not at all,"" he replies. But what if he loses again? ""My results are not married to my self-worth,"" he says. ""And that's where a lot of people get mistaken - especially young kids.

"A National Child Protection Inspection of Lincolnshire Police highlighted the failings in its third report on child care and safety in three years. Progress in some areas had been slowed by coronavirus, the report said. The force said it had robust plans in place to deliver the best service for keeping children safe. More stories across Lincolnshire The report from Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services, said the force's control room was good at identifying risks in cases involving vulnerable children and recording and sharing information when youngsters go missing. But there were ""too many examples"" where records were not created when children had been missing for just a short time, the inspectors found. There had been ""some improvements in the standards of investigations"" although the supervision of some cases was inconsistent. The report said: ""Some supervisors allocated investigations to their staff without clear guidance or instruction."" Additional training for investigation supervisors had been suspended because of the pandemic, but the force had plans to restart training before March. The report's authors also found that body-worn video is not used often enough by officers, especially in domestic abuse cases. Police officers were still not gathering and recording children's views enough, affecting around one third of all incidents involving children exposed to domestic abuse HM Inspector of Constabulary Zoë Billingham said: ""I am pleased to see that many of our previous concerns have been addressed. ""But there is still more work to do in order to provide better outcomes for vulnerable children in Lincolnshire - from ensuring body-worn video is used where it could help children, to actually gathering and recording the views of the children themselves. ""The pace of progress has been impeded partly, but not exclusively, by the impact of the pandemic.

"L'Oreal said that Natura had made a ""firm"" offer valuing the company at 1bn euros (£880m). Earlier this year, L'Oreal said it was reviewing its strategy for the chain, which it bought for £652m in 2006. The Body Shop was set up by Anita Roddick who promoted ethical beauty products. But in recent years it has suffered from increased competition from newcomers also offering products based on natural ingredients and no animal testing. L'Oreal chairman and chief executive, Jean-Paul Agon said: ""I am very pleased to announce Natura as the potential new ""home"" for the Body Shop. ""It is the best new owner we could imagine to nurture the brand DNA around naturality and ethics."" The chairman and chief executive of the Body Shop, Jeremy Schwartz said the ethical values and expertise of Natura made it 'the perfect new owner' of The Body Shop and would help it to rejuvenate the brand. Private equity group CVC and China's Fosun also made bids for the struggling business. Last year, the Body Shop's sales fell 4.8% and its profit margin dropped to 3.7%, far below the double-digit margins achieved by L'Oreal's other brands.

"Philip Gummett, of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (Hefcw), said governors ""should take an imaginative leap"". It comes as Cardiff Metropolitan University fights plans to merge it with two other universities. Meanwhile, two universities in south west Wales have united. In an interview with BBC Wales, Prof Gummett, who retires as Hefcw chief executive this month, re-stated the case for Wales having fewer but larger universities. Hefcw has recommended the creation of a new super university for south east Wales. But Cardiff Met has threatened to complain to public spending watchdogs about the Welsh government's plans for a forced merger between it and Glamorgan and Newport universities. It accuses Education Minister Leighton Andrews of failing to provide a business case. 'Imagination' Although he declined to name universities, Prof Gummett said opponents should not get ""hung up on debates about whether or not one can produce fully-costed business plans"". He said it was ""perfectly understandable for any institution to start a discussion like this from the point of view of the institution's own interests, and to say we're doing a good job and to say what is wrong with what we're doing."" ""But I would say it's important for governors - as they have done in other places and other parts of Wales - actually to raise their eyes above that and say nevertheless within this wider framework what's the best way forward,"" he said. ""And then to look constructively at ways forward, not to get hung up on debates about whether or not one can produce fully-costed business plans, because you can't at a stage like this."" He added: ""So I think one has to have the imaginative leap first that says we think we should raise our sights to a vision of what's best for the people of Wales and in the case you're referring to now the south east of Wales, what's the best way forward there, who should we be working with."" The board of governors at Cardiff Met has said it is considering making a report to the assembly's public accounts committee - which scrutinises Welsh government expenditure - about ""the manner in which the minister's office has behaved in this process with public money"". Mr Andrews says there needs to be fewer universities in Wales. In south west Wales, Swansea Metropolitan University and the University of Wales Trinity Saint David have agreed to unite. Under the merger - which will create a university of up to 13,000 students - the Swansea Met brand will remain, but it will come under the umbrella of Trinity Saint David.","Opponents of university mergers should think about what is best for Wales, according to the outgoing head of the body that funds higher education."
"By Rachel SchraerBBC Reality Check When it comes to becoming a citizen, Kensington Palace says Ms Markle will be treated like anyone else. Prince Harry's communications secretary, Jason Knauf, said Ms Markle would be ""compliant with immigration requirements at all times"". ""I can also say she intends to become a UK citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you may know takes a number of years,"" he added. It is not currently known whether she will retain her US citizenship and take dual nationality. Bringing Meghan into the country First, she will have to apply for a family visa in order to remain in the country. Since 2012, UK citizens have had to meet a minimum income threshold of £18,600 a year, or have cash savings above £16,000, to bring a partner into the country. We don't know precisely how much Prince Harry earns, but he shouldn't have any trouble with that. It's understood that he receives an income via his father. Prince Charles's estate, the Duchy of Cornwall, made him £20.7m profit last year. And Prince Harry also has access to a large inheritance from his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, which had been placed in a trust until he turned 30. Family visa applications will set you back £1,464, or £1,583 for a premium service. Non-EU partners of British citizens coming into the country on a family visa also have to pass an English speaking test - unless they come from one of a list of countries where English is an official language, including the United States. So US-born Ms Markle will be fine on this front. If someone comes to the country as the fiancee of a British citizen, they must marry within six months. With their engagement this month and the wedding planned for May 2018, they should just tie the knot in time. Generally, before someone comes into the country as the partner of a British citizen on a family visa, they must submit a range of evidence proving their relationship is real. This might include: We simply don't know if Ms Markle has begun this process already. Will they have to go to Croydon? The initial visa granted will last up to two and a half years, after which time it must be renewed. Home Office staff can ask couples to come to the Croydon headquarters of the UK Visa and Immigration service or one of six other immigration centres around the country for an interview, although not everyone will have to do this. After coming in on a family visa, individuals must wait five years before permanent residency is granted, also known as ""indefinite leave to remain"". Life in the UK Only then can they apply for citizenship, provided they have spent no more than 270 days outside the UK in the past three years. At this point, Ms Markle will have to take a test with questions on life in the UK, costing £50. According to the website Life in the UK Test Web, this could include multiple-choice questions such as ""Who is married to the Queen of England?"" and ""What is the relationship between the monarch and the government?"" In case Ms Markle needs any help, the Home Office produces an official handbook with everything she will need to know for the test. The citizenship application costs £1,282.

"Ben Gerring, 29, was in the water near Mandurah, south of Perth, when the attack occurred on Tuesday afternoon. Western Australia Police said Mr Gerring's injuries were too severe to overcome and he died on Friday night. On Thursday, a 4.2m (14ft) great white shark was captured near Mandurah, but it is not known if this shark was to blame for the attack.

"Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory, in the city's Chinatown, is the last factory of its kind in the area, after competitors were forced to close when overheads became too expensive. The family-run factory opened its doors on Ross Alley in 1962, and uses the same recipe to this day, as well as retaining the traditional machinery used to make Chinese fortune cookies. ""Even I don't know the recipe,"" co-owner Kevin Chan, whose mother and uncle founded the store, told the BBC. ""It's my mum's secret."" Chan, who stays up until 3am at night writing the fortunes which are inserted into the cookies, says he's proud the store remains open, but he's facing an uncertain future. ""My rent is $6,000 [£4,555] a month. Three years ago, it was $1,400. But I'm not going to just walk away. I'm not going to give up. I will keep going for as long as I can."" Chan's mother still works at the factory, along with three part-time employees. The store used to sell to restaurants and hotels but it couldn't compete with the bigger factories elsewhere in the US. Chan would charge $14 (£11) for a case containing 400 cookies. It takes Chan's factory around an hour and a half to produce one case of cookies. His staff work for eight or nine hours a day and are paid minimum wage - $15 an hour. ""There is no way I could make a profit. And then these other factories came along with modern technology. ""They use these fully automated machines. They can make 1m cookies in a day, individually wrapped, and sell a box of 400 for $8.95. I cannot compete with that."" Chan describes his methods and machinery as ""old-school style"". He has three traditional iron machines in his narrow factory; the oldest one is from 1956. ""It's hard,"" he continues. ""Old school doesn't exist in today's technology. But I'm determined to keep the traditions going."" Chan has switched from wholesale back to retail, and says even though keeping his factory open to tourists slows him and his workers down, he's determined to keep welcoming customers. ""I could just close them and nobody would bother me, but that's not my goal. My goal is to serve people, to offer them Chinese hospitality, to teach them about Chinese culture."" Keeping the doors open also poses logistical challenges; the staff wear gloves to protect their hands from the heat, as the cookies have to be folded while hot, as they shatter when they've cooled. ""In the winter, we have a lot of wastage, as sometimes our staff can't fold the cookies fast enough. And in the summer, it gets really really hot in here. ""But I want people to see how the cookies are made."" Chan, who was born in China but emigrated to the US when he was eight, points to a chip in one of the folding boards attached to the machine closest to the door. ""I put my hand through that board during one summer when I was nine years old. It was so hot in here, and we can't use air conditioning because of the cookies cooling too fast, and I got so frustrated I slammed my hand on the board and broke it."" Everything about the factory is traditional, even down to the bright pink bags Chan gives his customers - red is a lucky colour, but the pigment is expensive, so carrier bag manufacturers mix it with white pigment, resulting in pink. Chan's daughter isn't interested in taking over the business, but the businessman says he's not done just yet. ""I don't think about the future. I just try and carry on as I can right now. You never know nowadays, the landlord could decide to kick me out and I'd have to go anyway. ""But this is the heart of the factory, here on Ross Alley. No matter how much rent they charge me, I say 'go for it'. ""We've been doing this for 56 years and I've only adapted things slightly. No matter how hard things get I still want to do it. The customers make it all worth it."" Chan has made some adaptations to attract more customers into the store, including chocolate and matching tea-flavoured cookies. Customers can also opt to write their own fortune cookie messages, and Chan has even been part of aiding a few wedding proposals. Some customers have written wedding proposals as their fortune. Chan has seen nine people propose this way - one even putting the engagement ring inside. ""They always come back and tell me what happened,"" Chan muses. ""There's been a pretty good success rate actually, 85% in fact.""

"By News from Elsewhere......as found by BBC Monitoring Canon Uladzislaw Zavalnyuk, the rector of the Church of Saints Simon and Helena, told the Belarusian Christian news site Krynica.info that the city government has ordered the church to stop ringing its bells ""because they disturb local residents"". The priest professed himself baffled at this. ""There are many churches in Minsk with bells, but they're not being banned from ringing them,"" he complained to the site. Social media users were immediately suspicious of the city's motives. Above all, they note that there are few houses near what is popularly called the Red Church, a red-brick building that stands among government offices on Independence Square. And people nearby seem to have no problems with the bells. Nadzyeya Hatsak, who lives within sound of the bells, says she likes to hear them of a morning. ""They give the place a European feel, and you can't even hear them when you close your windows,"" she told Krynica. The idea that the pro-Russian government favours the Orthodox Church is common in opposition circles, mainly because the Catholic Church is stronger in western, Belarusian-speaking parts of the country, and is also associated with the Polish minority. This allegation of bias underpins much social media comment on the story. 'Orthodox are jealous' ""This is blatant injustice. The Orthodox cathedral in Nyamiha district rings its bells right next to a block of flats, but it's the Red Church that's the problem… there's a political and cultural subtext here,"" writes Anastasia Damanskaya on Facebook. ""The Orthodox are just jealous,"" says another Facebook user bluntly. Others point the finger directly at officials, given that the church is near the seat of government and many ministries. ""The bells stop the bureaucrats and city officials from having a nap, or the very sound makes their hands tremble and drop their bribes,"" writes Viktar Malyezhyk on the Krynica site. The Minsk city authorities have not commented directly on the story, despite approaches from major news sites, but a spokesman for the Belarusian Catholic Bishops' Conference was able to shed light on the story. Fr Yuryy Sanka told the TUT.by portal that the story has been blown out of proportion. ""No one wants to ban any bells, and I've not seen any banning order"" he said. The Red Church recently installed a set of electronic chimes to celebrate a Bishops' Conferences of Europe council meeting in Minsk, and these need to be switched off at least some of the time while the church closes for restoration work later this autumn. ""No one is against these chimes, it's just a matter of sorting out the reconstruction work. Once everything has been properly assessed and agreed, it's even possible that real bells will be installed. There's no conflict here,"" Fr Sanka says.

"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter And, if you can forget the over-use of what was a wartime propaganda phrase, it is still an instruction that is useful to characterise much of the prime minister's attitude. Indeed, when she's chosen a more dramatic tack it sometimes has not exactly gone well. Calling the election in 2017, her biggest strategic mistake, was an entirely unnecessary drama. And as the real crunch period for Brexit approaches, KCACO (surely there's a Whitehall acronym for this somewhere) is firmly the prime minister's approach. And despite the disagreements in the Tory party being ventilated every moment, Theresa May has, in public at least, little intention of overreacting - if reacting at all. The new heat of the Tory despair and disagreements is because we are now, at last you might say, nearing at least the beginning of the end of the Brexit process. There is less than a school term to go before the overall political deal is meant to be done. The stakes therefore are huge. And when times are anxious, the smallest thing can cause outrage or ecstasy. So in this kind of political atmosphere, every word, every warning, every stray comment, every indiscretion can send people screaming to slam the panic button. Inside government the plan is to keep going, take the knocks, carry on, however strong the resistance is, and to make a more determined effort to try to persuade people of the merits of their proposal. There is frustration inside government that the prime minister hasn't made more effort to expound the benefits of the Chequers approach. She did, after all, make chunky speeches on previous occasions when there were big developments in the government's thinking. Not this time. But in the frenetic run-up to the Tory conference, government ministers will be despatched around the country to at least try to get Tory Party members on side. But the calculation inside government is, as it has been throughout this very bumpy road, that in the end, there will be a Brexit deal and that a majority of MPs will be too alarmed at the prospect of no deal with the EU, which would mean no two year period of getting used to it, to do more than flirt with the notion of voting it down. In the end therefore, the government's assumption is that a deal would go through because of old-fashioned common sense. Here's the thing - politics is not always governed by common sense. People are also motivated by conviction, by ideology, by identity, by emotion, and a different kind of common sense. To many Tories in government it is common sense to try to stay as close to the EU as possible to try to minimise disruption. To many others, that's simply the wrong way to look at Brexit. And those Conservatives who want looser ties are very serious about what they are trying to do which is no less than force her to change tack. Theresa May is trying very hard to KCACO. She's showing no sign of budging - perhaps her deal will acquire a sense of inevitability. But despite warmer words from Brussels, at home with no majority Theresa May won't have the luxury of ignoring her critics forever.","Before 'keep calm and carry on' was a phrase that appeared on cushions, mugs, fridge magnets, and memes, it was a useful phrase to describe a particularly British attitude demonstrated by unflashy politicians who ignored (or should we say tried to ignore) colleagues who were looking for limelight, concentrated on what they were trying to get done and went back for more when times got rough."
"I don't know if schoolchildren are still given lines to write as punishment for doing something wrong. If such punishments are still given, then teachers in Ghana surely have their work cut out for them now. I can foresee pupils across the country being instructed to write the line ""I SHALL TAKE PUNCTUATION SERIOUSLY"" many times over. That's because even if we didn't know it before, we now know that the placing of an apostrophe can make a lot of difference. Ghana has got a new public holiday - on 4 August. Since the holiday this year happened to fall on a Sunday, it was celebrated on the following day. This new holiday in our national calendar has been achieved simply by the power of an apostrophe. Some people think we already have far too many public holidays. Then there are those who believe such holidays have nothing to do with productivity - they point to other countries who enjoy more public holidays and are yet are more productive than us. But the fear or joy of having a new holiday is not the bone of contention right now. Rather, it's about our nation's origins. Founder or founders? The government has formally declared 4 August a public holiday to commemorate Founders' Day - a celebration of those who founded the state of Ghana. The concept of a Founder's Day (note the placement of the apostrophe) had been introduced by the government of late President John Evans Atta Mills. He declared our first president, Kwame Nkrumah, the founder of Ghana and designated his birthday - 21 September - as Founder's Day. But an argument has ensued over whether we had one single founder, namely Nkrumah, or founders in the plural - being the group of people who started and led the fight for independence. You may also be interested in: President Atta Mills and his political supporters felt strongly that Nkrumah was the unchallenged, unquestioned founder of Ghana. It was Nkrumah who led us to independence and defined our identity, our ideology and our place in the world - they reasoned - and so would not hear of him sharing the honour of founder with anybody else. So, they instituted Founder's Day in 2009 when Mr Atta Mills became president. However there is the other political view in the country. This comes from a contingent that feels equally strongly that the state of Ghana was not founded by one person, but by a group of people, and so the honour should not be given to Nkrumah alone. This group argues that other people had engaged in the struggle for independence before Nkrumah came along, and that they were in fact the ones who invited Nkrumah to leave his life in Britain to join the collective fight. Nkrumah later broke away from that group in 1948 to form his own party, the Convention People's Party (CPP), which then led Ghana to independence. But that should not make him the sole founder, the thinking of this wing goes. But these arguments for plural founders did not find favour, and 21 September - Nkrumah's birthday - was duly introduced as Founder's Day and has been celebrated for the past decade. In 2017, the other wing of politics came into office, and earlier this year, the 21 September public holiday was re-named Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Day, and 4 August was declared Founders' Day. Plural. The date is significant for two reasons. Firstly, it was on 4 August 1897 that the Aborigines' Rights Protection Society (ARPS) was formed. It had successfully fought off a proposed law, the 1897 Crown Lands Bill, which sought to expropriate all our lands for the benefit of the British Crown. ARPS mobilised the chiefs and the public at large in the then Gold Coast, as Ghana was called under colonial rule, to agitate against the legislation. The pressure group even sent a delegation to the UK to protest against the bill. Consequently, the colonial power withdrew it, and the ownership of our lands was never an issue again during the colonial period. Many see this as the critical fight that saved our country from the type of land ownership problems that bedevilled British colonies in eastern and southern Africa. The other reason why 4 August is significant is that it was on that date in 1947, 50 years on from the founding of the ARPS, that Ghana's first political party made its public debut. Political battle Called the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), it was from this party that Nkrumah broke away to form the socialist CPP. The rest, as the saying goes, is history: Nkrumah was overthrown in a military coup in 1966, long periods of military rule were punctuated by the short-lived Second and Third Republics. Constitutional rule was re-established in 1993. It was the third head of state under the Fourth Republic, President Atta Mills, who wanted to celebrate Nkrumah as Ghana's founder. His party lost the 2016 election and President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo wanted to celebrate a collection of founders. Simply by moving the apostrophe from before the ""s"" to after the ""s"", we've moved from Founder's Day - one person - to Founders' Day - a collective. I used to be rather sloppy with punctuation. Now I know better. An apostrophe is all it takes to win this particular political battle.

"The total bill in Wales went from just over £5m in 2013/14 to more than £8m in 2015/16, according to six of Wales' seven health boards. It followed Freedom of Information requests to all UK NHS hospital bodies. The Welsh Government said it is working to recruit more consultants and addressing specialist shortages. The figures obtained by the BBC show one health board, Hywel Dda University Health Board covering mid and west Wales, saw its consultant overtime costs triple in the three-year period. The bill went from £266,426 in 2013/14 to £806,354 by the end of the last financial year. Two other boards - Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABMU) and Aneurin Bevan University Health Board - also saw overtime costs more than double. Increased demand Officials at Aneurin Bevan said rising costs reflected measures it was taking to cut waiting lists and improve care. ""Due to the increasing demand for our services the health board has put in place additional clinics to provide extra appointments for our patients both out of hours and on weekends. This resulted in increased staffing costs,"" said a board spokesperson. ABMU also said it had experienced higher than normal emergency pressures and it was working closely with the Welsh Government to reduce the need for extra operating lists. However, two other health boards did see decreases, including the largest in Wales, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which covers north Wales. It reduced its consultant overtime payments from £1.6m in 2013/14 to £775,000 in 2015/16 - a drop of 52%. Powys Teaching Health Board also managed to cut its bill by 28% in the same three years - from just over £500,000 to £360,000. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which runs Wales' largest hospital - the University Hospital of Wales - did not respond to the BBC request for information. The picture in Wales is repeated across much of the UK, with the figures released to the BBC showing overtime payments have increased by a third in the last three years to £168m. Hospitals have blamed the increased use of overtime on a shortage of consultants, meaning the only option is to pay for additional hours. A spokesman for the British Medical Association, which represents doctors across Britain, said: ""The fact is the NHS is only paying overtime on this scale because it does not have enough doctors to do the work."" Decisions on health spending in Wales are a devolved matter. Responding to the overtime figures, a Welsh Government official said: ""The demand for services provided by NHS Wales continues to grow. ""In order to address the challenges this poses, health boards have been working hard to recruit more staff, including consultants."" According to the government, the number of consultants working in the Welsh NHS has risen by 41% since 2005. ""It is also important to view these figures in context - the spend reported by Local Health Boards represents just over 0.1% of total LHB expenditure,"" the spokesman said.","The cost of covering overtime payments for consultants at Welsh hospitals has rocketed by 61% in the last three years, BBC News has discovered."
"The service was halted after 16 women were found to have the disease after originally being given an all-clear. This led to a report into 1,695 cases which were recalled for further tests. It found that needle biopsy tests had not been carried out in enough cases. A random sample of a further 1,000 records was then reviewed, and national standards were found to be met. The National Breast Screening Programme's Quality Assurance team found that although two of these women were later diagnosed with cancer, this was not due to problems with the north Cumbria service. Professor John Ashton, Cumbria's director of public health, said: ""Mammography is the most reliable way of detecting breast cancer early but, like other screening tests, it will not find every cancer. ""Nonetheless, each breast screening programme must demonstrate that it is meeting national standards. ""This final review into other aspects of the north Cumbria breast screening programme has been led by national experts who have analysed the results and judged that the programme was meeting expected standards."" The breast screening programme is now to be run in north Cumbria by Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in partnership with North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust, and will resume in January. North Cumbria University Hospitals Trust's chief executive, Carole Heatley, said: ""I would like to once again apologise on behalf of our trust for the distress and anxiety this issue has caused.""","North Cumbria's breast cancer screening service is meeting expected standards, a new review has found."

"By Tom AireyBBC News But with floods hitting several other parts of the UK in that most unseasonal of summers, the perception soon arose that the people of East Yorkshire were being denied the attention their plight merited and the support they needed. Coining Hull ""the forgotten city"", the council's then leader Carl Minns pointed out that ""if this was Chelsea or Fulham, this would have been plastered over the front pages for weeks"". Paul Tempest, who would not be able to return to his Cottingham home for a year, recalls there was a stark contrast in the way the floods that affected more affluent parts of Britain were reported. ""When there was flooding down south - we never had that level of news exposure - we saw people on the news in six inches deep of water and it made headlines,"" he said. ""We thought, 'wait a minute, we've had it to the waist'."" The floods that hit Hull and parts of East Yorkshire were caused by rainwater overwhelming drainage systems, in one instance with fatal consequences. Michael Barnett, 28, became trapped in a storm drain and died from hypothermia during an unsuccessful four-hour operation to free him from neck-high floodwater, which witnesses described as raging ""like Niagara Falls"". His father, also called Michael, went to the scene, in Hessle, five miles west of Hull, when he heard his son was in difficulty, but was turned away by the emergency services. ""[My son] said to the firemen, 'are you going to get me out of here?' He then passed out - it was too much for him,"" Mr Barnett said. ""He had gone under the water and six or seven of the firemen jumped in to try to save him with no thought for themselves - they all could have been sucked to the gate because it was quite fierce. ""He had a good life, he always enjoyed himself, but he has now lost 10 years - would he have married, had children? ""He used to say to me, 'I will look after you in your old age' - I couldn't look after him in his young age."" What happened in June 2007 - the damage caused was put at more than £40m and affected over 10,000 properties - prompted an independent review of the region's flood defences and led to millions being spent on improvements. However, despite the passing of a decade, some residents and businesses are still dealing with knock-on effects of the deluge. Former Hedon resident Sally Johnson said: ""A friend is still finding problems with her home, she goes out and monitors the rain as she likes to make sure it's not flooding. ""It impacts you for the rest of your life."" Martin Voase, based in the village of Brandesburton, 12 miles north of Hull, said the flood had changed the way he operates his farm. ""Potatoes were one of our main crops. That got completely annihilated and flooded out - we've not grown potatoes since,"" he said. ""We lost £200,000 of crops that year. We couldn't afford to take the risk of growing potatoes again, that was a big change."" Mrs Johnson's daughter took to a dinghy to complete her daily paper round as her mother watched children being evacuated from Inmans Primary School opposite their home. ""There were rats on the street afterwards, it was horrible - I felt so sorry for the children,"" she said. Every classroom of the school ended up underwater - 95 of the 98 schools in Hull suffered flood damage. Sally Morgan, head teacher of Inmans Primary School, said: ""Before the last 20 pupils left, we were gathered in the main hall and water was bubbling up through the floor. The children were standing on chairs. ""A year later we had some heavy rain and one or two of our children got upset and were panicking it was going to happen again; teachers were anxious too. ""We used to take some of the kids with us to check the drains to reassure them."" Clinical psychologists were appointed in the region to help support those children who suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after having to abandon their homes. Paul Tempest recalls there being a ""mad rush"" for rental housing while repairs were being carried out. ""At the estate agents, they had queues and a sign to a desk saying 'flood victims here'. It was like a warzone and you were almost a second-class citizen,"" he said. ""Eventually you couldn't get dehumidifiers, you were in a queue for four months just to get one. They became as rare as rocking horse dung."" His memories include carrying an elderly neighbour to safety and seeing piles of ruined furniture and broken TVs appearing on driveways. His wife Leslie Tempest said: ""I know now how people die in cold water; it was bitter, cold. I would not wish it on my worst enemy. ""There was never the recognition that it was a massive disaster, really."" Down the road from their home, seven lagoons capable of holding four million gallons of water were later created to store run-off from the Raywell Valley during storms. Following the Pitt Review, which looked into the overall impact of the June and July floods that killed 13 people nationwide, increased funding was provided to help deal with surface water flooding. More than £50m has been spent on defences in Hull and East Yorkshire since 2007, with a further £120m to be spent in the next four years, the Environment Agency said. But shoring up defences and renovating homes is only part of the process of moving on, points out Prof Maggie Mort, a Lancaster University academic who researched Hull's recovery from the floods. She said the mental struggle of having to rebound from such an occurrence ""affects people very deeply"". ""It's not the flood itself that causes the trauma, it's how you are treated afterwards and how your community, your family and agencies around you help you rebuild the social and personal fabric of your lives. ""The emergency phase of a flood gets the most attention [in the media], but the long slog of recovery is overlooked."" This effort to rebound from the despair caused by flooding is something that resonates with Jennifer and Michael Fox, whose home on Corona Drive near the city centre was in one of the areas worst hit by the deluge. The couple said what happened made them reassess what was important in their lives and caused them to try to keep a positive attitude, despite their plight. Mrs Fox said: ""Your doors, your walls, your sandbags: nothing can stop the water, nothing at all. By the next morning all of the water had gone, but everything was just absolutely ruined."" They cooked upstairs on a camping stove and washed their clothes in the bathroom while repairs were carried out. ""The men [working on] the house accidentally cut through the water pipe and flooded it again,"" Mr Fox said. ""We just fell about laughing, because it couldn't have got any wetter than it already was.""","On 25 June 2007, Hull was pummelled by rain for hours. Nearly every one of the city's 98 schools was damaged, thousands of people were forced from their wrecked homes, and a young man lost his life in the most horrific circumstances."
"He said an agreement had to be ""within our grasp"" if talks are to conclude at next week's summit of European leaders. He also warned that Theresa May's trade proposals would give UK companies a ""huge competitive edge"" over EU rivals. His comments came as the Democratic Unionists indicated they were prepared to vote against the Budget if it is unhappy with the Brexit deal. BBC Newsnight's Nick Watt said the Northern Ireland party would end its Parliamentary support for the prime minister if she agrees to anything that leads to additional checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Earlier Mrs May urged MPs to ""put the national interest first"" when deciding whether to approve the Brexit deal in a crunch vote likely later this year. The UK and the EU have yet to strike a deal on how Brexit will work, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves on 29 March. One of the key things they have not yet agreed is how to prevent there being new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU. There have been warnings that a so-called ""hard border"" will damage businesses and undermine peace in Northern Ireland. Both the UK and the EU have resolved to put in place a ""backstop"" - which is a kind of insurance policy to prevent a hard border in case the final trade deal they agree does not do this. Speaking to business leaders in Brussels, Mr Barnier said negotiators were ""intensively"" working to find a deal. 'Politically sensitive' He said there would have to be checks on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, because they would effectively be arriving in the EU's single market if there was no hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""I understand why such procedures are politically sensitive,"" he said, but added ""Brexit was not our choice, it is the choice of the UK. ""Our proposal tries to help the UK in managing the negative fallout of Brexit in Northern Ireland in a way that respects the territorial integrity of the UK."" Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Mr Barnier said there were several areas of agreement with Mrs May's plans, published in a White Paper in July. But he also set out key objections to her proposed new trading relationship which involves a UK-EU customs partnership and a ""common rulebook"" for goods travelling across the border. This would lead to a loss of customs duty income for EU states, he said. And on the plans to align rules on goods, he added: ""This type of single market system a la carte would be tantamount to giving a huge competitive edge to UK companies with respect to companies operating within the single market."" However, if an agreement could be reached, the EU will have 10 ""parallel negotiating teams"" ready to start drawing up the details straight after Brexit day, he added.","Brexit negotiators are working ""day and night"" to try to reach a deal, the EU's Michel Barnier has said."
"Using MRI scanners, researchers at the University of Portsmouth will analyse whether the proportion of fat and glandular tissue affects perkiness. Participants will be paid £30 and asked to run on a treadmill while sensors monitor the movement of their breasts. Scientists hope their findings will be used to develop new bra designs. Leaders of the study, being held at the St Mary's NHS Treatment Centre in the city, said the work would offer new insights into variations in women's breasts. Bralet boom and why the underwire is under fire Senior Research Associate Dr Tim Blackmore said: ""This research will be the first time scientists will have evidence on whether the density of breasts affects their movement. ""The results will allow us to better understand the demands different women's breasts put on bras and, for example, why one bra design won't work for every woman. The university's Research Group in Breast Health works with lingerie manufacturers, the military, the NHS and other organisations to develop new bra designs. Penny Daniels, hospital director at the treatment centre, said: ""This is a worthwhile project, as not only may it allow greater comfort for women everywhere at the end of a very long day at work, but it may also reveal valuable insights into women's health and wellbeing.""","A study into the science of saggy boobs - aiming to establish why ""one bra design doesn't fit all"" - is appealing for volunteers."
"Using biometric methods, including an iris scan, the system will log details of India's population of more than one billion people on a central database. It was launched by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi in western India. The data will be stored online in what India says will be the biggest such national database in the world. The unique identification (UID) programme will help those in poor, marginalised communities who find it difficult to access public services and benefits because they do not have official records, officials say. The government expects to give a UID number to every Indian citizen within four years. Birth registration is not universal and it is hoped that the database will give an accurate picture of Indian society. 'Special moment' The new ID scheme was launched in the village of Tembhili in Nandurbar district of western Maharashtra state. The ID numbers were handed out to 10 people, including three children. The tiny village of 1,500 people was colourfully decorated and the villagers were excited to see Congress chief Sonia Gandhi - who smiled and waved at them - although few locals knew what the scheme was about, the BBC's Prachi Pinglay reports from Tembhili village. Prime Minister Singh described the start of the process as a ""special moment"" that would empower the most marginalised in society. ""It will help strengthen the rights of the downtrodden and the poorest, including women,"" AFP news agency quoted him as saying. Mrs Gandhi described the launch as a ""new beginning"" for India. Billionaire IT expert Nandan Nilekani, who was drafted in by the government to run the project, was also present at the function. Under the scheme, all Indians will be issued a 12-digit ID number which they will use to receive welfare handouts, to apply for other documents like passports and even to open bank accounts, the BBC's Mark Dummett in Delhi says. As well as iris scans, photographs, fingerprints and other personal information will be collected and then stored on a vast central database. The government hopes this will prevent corrupt officials from faking the names of people seeking welfare benefits or access to education - potentially saving billions of dollars. Critics, however, complain that the project itself will cost billions of dollars and are also worried about the authorities collecting so much personal information. Others say there is no guarantee that the scheme really will make much of a difference to India's corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy. Some say the focus should be on improving services for the poor, rather than access to them.",India has launched a huge national identity scheme aimed at cutting fraud and improving access to state benefits.
"The plan is part of a series of Scottish government proposals on tackling a funding gap in higher education. Other options in a new Green Paper include a graduate tax and increased support from business and donations. Ministers have ruled out re-introducing up-front tuition fees for Scots. Scottish students studying at home currently pay no tuition fees, while other UK students currently at Scottish universities pay £1,820 per year for mainstream courses. The Scottish government aims to implement its changes in 2012, in line with the reforms in England. 'Fee refugees' The UK government's move to raise tuition fees in England to as much as £9,000 a year has prompted outrage among students and violent protest. The Scottish government says the state should be the main provider for education, with access to it based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay. Education Secretary Mike Russell's Green Paper outlined six options for future funding: Mr Russell has expressed concern that rising fees in England may lead to a flood of so-called ""fee refugees"" coming to study in Scotland. Unveiling his proposals at the Scottish Parliament, said the reforms were also about excellence in higher education, adding: ""We must of course encourage others to study here and encourage more of our students to study abroad. ""But we must never become a cheap option. Our excellence must be our beacon - not our price."" Mr Russell branded the move in England ""flawed"", saying the state had abdicated its funding responsibility, that it was based on the ""mistaken belief"" that only individuals benefited from higher education and that it affected the ability of poorer people to study. ""After all, higher education is one of our most valuable national assets, it would be wrong of us not to protect its value and enhance its reputation,"" he said. ""So that is why the state assuming the prime funding responsibility, coupled with this Parliament's rejection of tuition fees, lies at the heart of the paper I am launching today."" Mr Russell, who said there was ""no silver bullet"" to solve the funding issues, also called for political consensus and ""absolute clarity"" from parties before the Scottish Parliament elections in May next year. He said not all the ideas in the green paper were supported by the government but said a re-elected SNP administration would legislate in the second half of 2011. Graduate contribution The three main opposition parties challenged the education secretary to give a definitive answer on whether the SNP's preferred option would include some form of graduate contribution. Labour education spokesman Des McNulty said: ""This document contains no models, no work-out options and very few numbers. It could have been produced months ago. It takes us no further forward."" Conservative education spokeswoman Elizabeth Smith said: ""Does the Scottish government's preferred option, option one, mean that graduates will now have to make a contribution, and if so how much? ""Secondly, why has it taken the government three years to produce what is little more than a discussion paper, when the universities sector and my party were warning of the urgent need for solutions to address that issue all that time ago?"" Liberal Democrat finance spokesman Jeremy Purvis called on the Scottish government to recognise the inequalities within Scotland. He said: ""Only one in five young people from deprived backgrounds go into further education, compared to four in five from affluent backgrounds, and that's when university places were free."" Liam Burns, President of NUS Scotland, said tuition fees were ""simply unacceptable regardless of where you come from"", and raising fees for other UK students was a ""knee jerk reaction"". But he added: ""If fees go up in Scotland for students from the rest of the UK, it will be directly down to the Scottish Liberal Democrat and Conservative MPs that voted for the trebling of fees in the rest of the UK. ""We warned that this would be the consequence of voting to treble fees in the rest of the UK and today, the seven Liberal Democrat MPs in Scotland that failed to keep their pledge to vote against increased fees should hang their head in shame."" Here is a selection of your comments on this story.","Students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland who go to university in Scotland could face annual fees of up to £6,000."
"But the scandal has since embroiled the police in accusations that they have not been sufficiently robust in disciplining officers accused of trying to discredit the MP as part of a campaign to ""toxify"" his party. BBC News looks back at how the row unfolded. 19 September 2012 Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, then the government's chief whip, has a row with police officers who would not let him cycle through Downing Street's main gate. 20 September 2012 The story is revealed in the Sun newspaper, which reports that he swore at the officers and called them ""plebs"" who should learn their place. 21 September 2012 Mr Mitchell denies using the word ""plebs"" but apologises for being disrespectful. 24 September 2012 Mr Mitchell says he wants to ""draw a line"" under the incident, telling reporters: ""I did not use the words that have been attributed to me."" But speculation about the exact words he did use continues. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urges him to explain ""fully and in detail his version of events"". 25 September 2012 A police log of the incident, appearing to confirm previous reports and contradict Mr Mitchell's position, is leaked to the Daily Telegraph. 7 October 2012 Mr Mitchell remains in his job, but members of the Police Federation wear ""PC Pleb"" T-shirts at demonstrations against police funding cuts at the Conservative Party conference. 12 October 2012 Three local representatives of the Police Federation meet Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office for 45 minutes, telling reporters afterwards that he had still not disclosed the precise words he used in the incident. They criticise him for implying that the Downing Street officers' accounts are not accurate. The chief whip has ""no option but to resign"", one representative concludes. 17 October 2012 David Cameron tells Parliament that what Mr Mitchell ""did and said"" was wrong, but since he had apologised and the officer involved had accepted his apology, he should be allowed to get on with his job. But opposition leader Ed Miliband says that, despite the apology, Mr Mitchell is ""toast"". 19 October 2012 Mr Mitchell resigns, claiming the ""damaging publicity"" means he can no longer do his job. In his resignation letter to the PM, he writes: ""The offending comment and the reason for my apology to the police was my parting remark 'I thought you guys were supposed to f***ing help us.' ""It was obviously wrong of me to use such bad language and I am very sorry about it and grateful to the police officer for accepting my apology."" 16 December 2012 A police constable with the diplomatic protection group is arrested on suspicion of misconduct in a public office, and suspended from his duties in connection with accounts of the Downing Street incident. 18 December 2012 CCTV footage, broadcast on Channel 4 news, casts doubt on the police officers' version of events. The police log said Mr Mitchell's use of a number of expletives had left members of the public looking on ""visibly shocked"". But the footage suggests that no-one other than the officers involved were within earshot. Mr Mitchell says he has fallen victim to a ""stitch-up"". 19 December 2012 Scotland Yard says it is opening an investigation into claims that an officer gave false evidence. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe says: ""The allegations in relation to this case are extremely serious. For the avoidance of doubt, I am determined there will be a ruthless search for the truth - no matter where the truth takes us."" In the ensuing months, eight people are arrested and bailed under the investigation, codenamed Operation Alice, including five police officers. 7 March 2013 Mr Mitchell launches libel action against the Sun over its reporting of the ""plebgate"" incident. 19 September 2013 A year after the original incident, former home secretary Jack Straw criticises the ""inordinate and unjustified"" length of time the investigation has taken. 15 October 2013 Independent Police Complaints Commission deputy chair Deborah Glass says the IPCC disagrees with police chiefs' decision not to hold misconduct hearings on the three Federation officers involved in the October 2012 meeting with Mr Mitchell. The IPCC releases a transcript of the meeting - from a recording made by Mr Mitchell - which shows that, while he admitted swearing, Mr Mitchell denied using the word ""pleb"" or insulting the police. However, after the meeting the three officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should resign. Home Secretary Theresa May says it would be ""quite wrong"" to take no action against those officers. The chief constables of their forces say they will welcome the opportunity to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain why no action was taken against them. 16 October 2013 David Cameron says Mr Mitchell is ""owed an apology"" by police over the row. It also emerges that an internal report which ultimately found no misconduct case to answer by the three officers who met Mr Mitchell at his constituency office had initially proposed disciplinary action. 21 October 2013 The three officers, Ken MacKaill, Stuart Hinton and Chris Jones, apologise for their ""poor judgement"" in talking to the media following their meeting with Mr Mitchell. They say they did not ""plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred"". But friends of Mr Mitchell tell the BBC the statement is ""a regrettable non-apology"". 23 October 2013 The three Federation officers insist to the Home Affairs Select Committee that they do not owe Mr Mitchell an apology. They say they stand by their ""accurate"" account of the meeting and Mr Jones says he is ""not convinced we have done anything wrong"". But the head of West Mercia Police tells the committee the handling of the affair was ""clumsy"" and the internal report and its recommendations should be independently reviewed. 27 October 2013 Sir Hugh Orde, head of the Association of Chief Police Officers, says the conduct of the three officers fell ""below that required"" and they should apologise. 31 October 2013 Three civilians and five police officers on bail over the plebgate affair are re-bailed to a date in late November. 3 November 2013 The IPCC says it is conducting its own investigation into the conduct of the three Federation officers - Ken MacKaill, Stuart Hinton, and Chris Jones - saying there were ""procedural irregularities"" in the earlier internal police probe. It also emerges that the trio will be called back before the Home Affairs Select Committee. Its chairman, Labour's Keith Vaz, says MPs were ""appalled"" by the officers' original evidence and that if they did not ""correct the record"" they would be in contempt of Parliament. 6 November 2013 Stuart Hinton apologises to the the home affairs committee for an ""inadvertent error"" in his earlier evidence. He also says he regrets the ""distress"" felt by Mr Mitchell and his family during the whole saga. Chris Jones, also appearing before the committee, insists he did not mislead MPs over his disciplinary record. 26 November 2013 PC Keith Wallis is charged with misconduct in a public office, accused of falsely claiming to have witnessed the incident in an email to his MP. But prosecutors say there is insufficient evidence to show an officer in Downing Street lied in his account of what happened. Separately, the Independent Police Complaints Commission says five members of the Metropolitan Police's Diplomatic Protection Group will face gross misconduct proceedings linked to the subsequent row, meaning they could lose their jobs. The BBC understands that the officer at the Downing Street gates on the night of the incident is not one of the five. 4 December 2013 PC Toby Rowland, the police officer who was on duty at Downing Street, says he is going to sue Mr Mitchell for libel over comments he made to the media following the incident. 16 December 2013 PC Keith Wallis appears at Westminster Magistrates' Court charged with misconduct in a public office, accused of falsely claiming to have witnessed the incident. He did not enter a plea. 10 January 2014 PC Keith Wallis admits misconduct. 5 February 2014 Metropolitan Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe meets Mr Mitchell to apologise for PC Keith Wallis's role in the affair. 6 February 2014 PC Keith Wallis is sentenced to 12 months in prison. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Sweeney said Wallis had been guilty of ""sustained, and in significant measure, devious misconduct which fell far below the standards expected of a police officer"". 26 February 2014 PCs Keith Wallis and James Glanville are sacked for gross misconduct. The Met said Mr Glanville was dismissed for passing information about the incident to the Sun newspaper. 27 April 2014 It emerges that PC Toby Rowland is seeking up to £200,000 in damages from Mr Mitchell for suggesting he was not telling the truth about the September 2012 altercation by the Downing Street gates. In documents submitted to the High Court, lawyers for PC Rowland justify the claim on the grounds that his reputation has been damaged by Mr Mitchell's remarks and he suffered ""great distress, humiliation and upset"". 30 April 2014 PC Gillian Weatherley is dismissed for gross misconduct by the Metropolitan Police over leaks to the press about the ""plebgate"" affair. 21 May 2014 PC Susan Johnson, a Metropolitan Police officer serving with the diplomatic protection group, is sacked for gross misconduct over the press leaks. 6 October 2014 A High Court ruling finds there was no proper final report prepared for the investigation into the three Police Federation officers who met Mr Mitchell. That probe was conducted by West Mercia Police but supervised by the IPCC. The High Court also quashed the IPCC's decision to investigate the case itself. An IPCC spokesman said it ""welcomed"" the ruling that the decisions of the three police forces had been ""invalid"" and said it would make a ""fresh assessment"" of the case. 3 November 2014 The IPCC again says it is to investigate three Police Federation officers over the ""plebgate"" affair, having re-assessed the case. 17 November 2014 The libel trial involving Mr Mitchell and former PC Toby Rowland gets under way in the High Court in London. Lawyers for Mr Mitchell tell the court that the police spun a ""web of lies"" that led to a ""vitriolic"" campaign against their client. 19 November 2014 Musician and aid campaigner Sir Bob Geldof is cited as a character witness for Mr Mitchell, a former international development secretary. In a written statement submitted to the court, Sir Bob describes Mr Mitchell as a ""good man"" and ""an advocate for the less fortunate"", adding that he had never heard him ""use the ridiculous and archaic expression 'pleb'"". 20 November 2014 A former police officer who was on duty during the ""plebgate"" incident denies wishing to harm Mr Mitchell or the government. Gillian Weatherley, who was sacked over leaks of alleged details of the row, tells the court that text messages she sent suggesting she could ""topple the Tory government"" were meant to be sarcastic. 24 November 2014 A police officer who accompanied Mr Mitchell on two foreign trips says the former cabinet minister was ""unpleasant until he got what he wanted"". Insp Duncan Johnston, who travelled with the then international development secretary in 2011, tells the court Mr Mitchell would ""erupt"" but later be charming. Separately, two former Conservative whips state in written evidence that Mr Mitchell had been unable to recall the exact words he had used in the days and weeks after the event. 27 November 2014 Former government chief whip Andrew Mitchell loses his High Court libel action. Mr Mitchell had sued News Group Newspapers over the story in the Sun in 2012 which claimed he called PC Toby Rowland a ""pleb"". Mr Mitchell acknowledged that he had used bad language but maintained he had not used that word. Delivering his ruling, Mr Justice Mitting said he was satisfied that the MP did say the word ""pleb""",Allegations that Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell called some police officers plebs during a row in Downing Street cost him his government job.

"By Dhruti ShahBBC News We're in a world where billions will log on to social media and chat apps so they can communicate instantly with friends and family overseas. But perhaps we are at a point where people want to return to a more simple world, where physical letters give us a sense of reality. Some businesses certainly think it's time that we do. I'm that friend who keeps every handwritten personal note and letter I've ever received. I have a box at home where these letters live - some are from old friends, some are from now long dead loved ones, and some mark momentous occasions in my life. A few months ago I spotted - on Facebook, ironically enough - a friend posting about a business set up to help unemployed tour guides in Mali make money, be active and tap into a letter-writing community which appears to be seeing a bit of a revival. Postcards from Timbuktu was set up by Phil Paoletta and it does it exactly what the name suggests. You can be anywhere in the world, log on to your computer and send a postcard via one of the most remote places in the world. Mali doesn't get a huge amount of visitors - the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to the country because of the instability it has seen in recent years. However, Mali has a strong literary culture and its spiritual and intellectual capital, Timbuktu, has been an important desert trading post throughout history. To get a postcard stamped at its post office was to know people in a very far away place. Phil was in Bamako in Mali in January 2015 when he received a postcard from a friend in the US. ""It was the first time I had received a postcard in years,"" he recalls. ""You rarely get tangible mail these days."" Coincidentally, that same day Phil ran into his friend Ali Nialy, a former tour guide from Timbuktu who was trying to find a job and having real difficulties. ""Unless you're working for the UN or an NGO, there's nothing out there for you."" The two came up with the idea of setting up the business, word quickly spread, and the operation now involves 10 people. You log on to the site, type out a personalised note, pay $10 (£8) and at some point in the future, a handwritten postcard with a Timbuktu stamp pops through your (or your chosen recipient's) letterbox. Once you've paid up, the words you write are sent via Whatsapp to a writer in Timbuktu. The note is then delivered by the postman on his bike to Timbuktu's Post Office where it gets its all important stamp. Then it's sent back to Mali's capital Bamako, sometimes through a hitched ride on a UN flight down to the city. This is essential as it's only possible to send mail internationally from Bamako. ""We get all sorts of messages. One couple sent a card to the person they wanted to officiate at their wedding. We've had birthday messages, get well soon messages, passive aggressive notes - everything,"" says Phil. ""It's been really interesting for the former tour guides because they are used to interacting with people all over the world and although there are fewer tourists now, they can still be ambassadors for Timbuktu through this."" The team have sent hundreds of postcards with interest surging. Phil says the current business model means the tour guides get about $6 after shipping, printing, the website platform costs and taxes are set aside. ""So for a $10 postcard, they get a decent amount of money for what amounts to a few minutes' work really."" Read more: Postcard from 1937 returned to family Letter gets there by hand-drawn map Meeting Mali's most dedicated postman It's an idea that science educator Jean Pennycook is familiar with. She works in a remote part of Antarctica - Cape Royds - where she lives with Adelie penguins for several months of the year. For the past 13 years, thousands of people have sent her postcards they've designed with pictures of penguins on - so she can return them with a very special Antarctica postmark. ""It's a valuable postmark as you can't get it unless you mail the letter in Antarctica. This project is providing a geography lesson, a penguin studies lesson and a letter-writing lesson as the kids have to do it all themselves,"" says Jean. ""Sometimes an entire school will send postcards down to me. To save money, we do it in bulk and instead of maybe costing $100, we're able to send them all back and it costs them just $5 in prepaid stamps.

Author Jon McGregor edits The Letters Page - a literary journal that only accepts handwritten submissions and pays £100 for those chosen for publication. He gave up email for an entire year, asking people to contact him via letter only in a bid to try to focus on his latest novel. ""A lot of people actually just left me alone. A few people who did write to me and send me stuff by post - those communications actually developed into meaningful connections with other writers. It showed the difference between email and letters and the way you can forge a connection with someone,"" he says. ""But at the same time, I realised how convenient email is. You're able to contact more than one person at once and send documents or pictures. It was quite a relief to get to the end of the year. ""When I started The Letters Page, it was interesting to see how many people shared that nostalgia for letters and letter writing. The envelope it comes in bears the traces of the journey, while the letter itself - the handwriting, the coffee stains, the doodles, the choices of paper - all of these are part of the message. When you get an email, you just get the words and that's that. ""I think people are looking back to letters and letter writing as a general reawakening of things which are hand-made or unique in some way and have a personal touch."" Both Jon McGregor and Jean Pennycook say that many young people are now used to the informal way language is used in social media and so letter writing is an extra skill for them to master. ""There are many who have had no training in how to write a letter or that writing an email can be as formal as writing a letter. That's a life skill - changing your register and recognising your audience,"" says Jon. ""Students can grasp if they are writing a letter for an application for a job or a course, they have to write with a certain level of formality, but they don't necessarily straight away grasp they need a different tone of voice with their friends on Whatsapp than they do with their grandmother."" But could the art of letter writing become a viable business market for some? Go online and you'll see people live blogging events such as Letters Live - where audiences pay to watch celebrities read out letters, or check your phone and come across apps or platforms such as My Postcard or Touchnote which will send your pictures as postcards to loved ones. ""If I get a postcard from someone who's away somewhere, it's as much the thought that they've gone through the hassle of choosing a postcard, working out where to get a stamp from, finding a postbox and then the postcard making that journey through to me. That's part of the value of the postcard as an object which you can handle,"" says Jon.

"Accounts filed at Companies House show that the chain's parent firm raised £100m from shareholders in September. But a spokeswoman told the BBC that Nando's UK was ""a strongly performing business in normal times"" and that talk of a crisis was untrue. She said it was not currently in any detailed talks with banks. In the year to 23 February, Nando's Group Holdings, including its UK operation, saw revenues rise 4.2% to £1.1bn. In that period, it opened 24 new UK restaurants, bringing the total to 434. UK revenues went up 2.8% to £801.5m, with pre-tax profit down from £96m to £70.4m. Nando's said its restaurants in the UK were now open again, with the exception of its Gatwick Airport outlet. Fears over the financial health of the firm were sparked by a report in the Telegraph newspaper which said that the increase in its debt pile had led to crisis talks. But Nando's spokeswoman said that ""just isn't true"". She said the next covenant test on the firm's loans was six months away. ""Given the rapidly changing situation, there are no detailed talks with banks on this yet,"" she added. ""Clearly if the vaccine roll-out progresses, we will be in a different position then than now, but in general, Nando's have had ongoing and constructive talks with all their banks."" The spokeswoman said those discussions had always taken place ""in an orderly and pre-emptive fashion"".",Chicken chain Nando's has denied media reports that it is in debt crisis talks after spending £20m on Covid-proofing for its UK restaurants.
"Total worldwide group sales fell 6.1% in the 12 weeks to 4 January, with UK like-for-like sales down 4%. Chief executive Simon Calver said ""difficult"" trading conditions in the UK and volatile international markets had been behind the sales fall. In the UK, weaker footfall and price cutting hit sales and margins. The drop in the share price wiped about £112m off the company's market value. Mr Calver said full-year profits at the mother and baby products retailer were ""likely to be below the current range of market expectations"". He said Mothercare's international trading had been hit by currency movements. In addition, he said that some of its larger markets, such as Russia and the Middle East, had suffered from ""unseasonal weather which impacted sales"". UK restructuring plan Mothercare's internet sales fell by 1% after the company decided not to repeat last year's free delivery offer for the Early Learning Centre website. Ishaq Siddiqi, market strategist at ETX Capital, said the move was a ""bad call"" by Mothercare. Mr Siddiqi added: ""Management now have to figure out a turnaround strategy or face the real likelihood of a fate similar to that of Comet and Woolworths."" Mothercare acquired the owner of the Early Learning Centre (ELC), Chelsea Stores Holdings, in 2007. Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said Mothercare's takeover of the ELC business continued to cause difficulties with the toy market ""extremely tough"". He said: ""The full extent of the task ahead for the relatively new chief executive looks to have been laid bare."" Mr Bowman said previously ""favourable analyst opinion"" would ""likely be reined in"". The retailer operates 191 Mothercare stores and 40 Early Learning Centre outlets in the UK. It also has 1,201 international stores across 59 countries. It has closed 80 UK stores under its restructuring plan to date. In November last year the company reported a £2m underlying profit in its half-year results and said its plan was beginning to work.",Shares in Mothercare have fallen 31% following a profit warning as a result of Christmas discounting in the UK and weak economic conditions overseas.

"Australian-born Rudd, 61, had originally denied the charges but changed his plea in April. He threatened to ""take out"" a former employee, the Tauranga court heard. When police went to question him over the threats they found a stash of marijuana and methamphetamine. His sentence will be served at his beachfront home in Tauranga, with Judge Thomas Ingram warning he would face jail if he breached the conditions, New Zealand media reported. He had faced a jail term of up to seven years for the threat charges. Arriving at court, Rudd made no comment to reporters but thanked fans for their support. Telephone threats The court had heard how Rudd had fired several employees after the failure of his solo album, Head Job, in August last year. Then in September, he telephoned an associate in Australia saying he wanted one of those former employees ""taken care of"", said court documents. In another call he offered the associate ""NZ$200,000, ($135,000; £88,000) a motorbike, one of his cars or a house"", which the man believed would be in exchange for carrying out the request. Rudd also called the victim of the threat, saying: ""I'm going to come over and kill you."" The drugs were found when police raided his home on 6 November. Rudd was originally charged with attempting to procure a murder, but that charge was dropped, as was a charge that he also threatened the victim's daughter. Rudd's lawyer had said the threats were ""just an angry phone call"" and that a drug conviction would have serious final consequences for the drummer, meaning he could not travel to some countries to perform. Judge Thomas Ingram dismissed this, though accepted that Rudd had reconciled with the victim and paid compensation. ""Some of the affidavit material put before me suggests that you are integral to the band's sound and you are an iconographical member of the band,"" said Judge Ingram. ""That point doesn't persuade me completely. Queen have replaced Freddie Mercury and it's clear that the band is currently touring without you."" Rudd is not currently a member of AC/DC, one of the world's biggest rock bands, and has not been invited to join them on their tour of New Zealand and Australia later this year.","Phil Rudd, a drummer with rock group AC/DC, has been sentenced in New Zealand to eight months in house detention for drug possession and making threats to kill."
"Isobel Harling, 97, has looked after the graves in Kingussie, in the Cairngorms, for more than 70 years. A service was held on Saturday to celebrate her awarding of the British Empire Medal (BEM). She was recommended for the medal because of her dedication to the war graves and also charitable work. The Army in Scotland and Royal British Legion Scotland have helped to organise the small service, taking place at the war memorial in Kingussie. Mrs Harling attended with her daughter Gaynol. Social distancing was adhered to and the event was live streamed so family and friends living in other parts of the UK and also New Zealand and Norway could watch. Mrs Harling, who served with the Women's Royal Naval Service during the war, began tending to the nine graves when she was in her 20s. The soldiers served in Force K6, a Muslim transport corps who rode mules and delivered supplies to front-lines. They died while in the Highlands for training. The youngest of the nine men was Mushtaq Ahmad, who was only 21-years-old when he was killed in action on 19 October 1942. The oldest in the group was Ali Bahadur, who died aged 38. Mrs Harling, from Kingussie, lost a brother in the war when he his aircraft was shot down over Leuven in Belgium. Her own loss influenced her dedication to the graves of the Indian soldiers. For many years, Mrs Harling tended the graves herself. Later, with help from a local gravedigger, she spent years cutting the grass, placing flowers on the graves and keeping the cemetery tidy. Her volunteer work with Royal British Legion Scotland has also seen her help raise thousands of pounds for the care of every war grave and war memorial in her home area of Badenoch and Strathspey. Mrs Harling's BEM was announced in the Queen's New Year's Honours list in December.",A woman who has tended to the graves of Indian soldiers killed while training in the Highlands in World War Two has been honoured in her home village.
"Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The cavernous halls of the Las Vegas Convention Centre have always provided sensory overload during CES. We will be there next week, trying to pick out what's hot and what's ho-hum amongst the thousands of new products vying for attention. Here are some of the themes we hope to explore: A brighter picture For most households, the television is still the most important gadget in their daily lives. And, at CES, the big Japanese and South Korean manufacturers try to excite us with something new. In recent years, the big stories have been about internet connected TVs, 3D and OLED (organic light-emitting diode) - a technology which offers beautiful pin-sharp pictures at eye-watering prices. This year there will be more of the same, although I'm expecting manufacturers to be less eager to push 3D which has met with a lukewarm reception from consumers. Instead the focus will be on bigger, better screens with something called Ultra High Definition - the next big thing after HD - making its debut. Samsung is also rumoured to be unveiling a transparent TV, while there is even talk of flexible screens. How soon these new TVs will be available - and at prices that anyone but the super-rich can afford - is another matter. Smarter phones Two months before the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, CES seems keen to steal its thunder. A host of new smartphones will be launched in Las Vegas, with China's Huawei and ZTE, and Japan's Sony among those unveiling devices. Just as with TVs, the accent is on ever bigger screens with the boundary between phones and tablets becoming blurred. But there will also be gimmicks designed to differentiate new phones in a market where everything looks much the same. To keep mobile users busy with their new devices, there will be a vast array of new apps on show, designed to let you do everything from monitor your health to switch on the lights at home from your phone. Wearable computing Wearable computing is the hot new idea for 2013, though Google Glass - the augmented reality product which has helped spark the boom - won't be in Las Vegas (and may not be available to consumers for quite a while). Wearing glasses, watches or other devices with an internet connection to provide you with data or a new view of your surroundings is a futurist's dream that is now becoming practical as fast mobile networks spread. Many of the devices are aimed at the health and fitness markets, and I hope to try a few in Las Vegas to monitor the way my body copes with the CES experience. Automated cars Another Google innovation - its plan for self-driving cars - appears to have pushed the big players in the automotive industry to start coming up with their own automated driving ideas. Toyota and Lexus will be unveiling what they call an advanced active safety research vehicle, which they've been testing in recent months. It appears to know how to change lanes safely without driver assistance - but years of development and law changes lie ahead before you can climb into the back seat and let the computer up front get on with it. New user interfaces The way we interact with computers has been transformed in recent years, as we move from the mouse and keyboard to the touchscreen experience. CES, once the place to see the latest personal computers, will still have plenty on show. But many PC laptops will be convertibles, designed to turn into tablets for the hybrid environment of Windows 8. We will also see more voice-activated devices, though the jury is out on how keen we are to talk to our PCs and phones. There may be more excitement around the idea of gesture controlled devices, using technology like that in Microsoft's XBox Kinect system.","The technology year always starts with the biggest, brashest gadgetfest of them all - the Consumer Electronics Show."
"Guernsey Dairy General Manager, Andrew Tabel, blames a desire for healthier diets on the sales slump. In 2002, about 900,000 litres of full-cream milk were sold, which had dropped to fewer than 690,000 in 2013. By law, the only fresh milk allowed to be sold in Guernsey is from Guernsey cows on the island. Mr Tabel said people were switching to the semi-skimmed product, but that it could also be a good thing for the company. ""From a business perspective, the more people that consume lower fat products, the more cream we have to produce butter with,"" he said. ""So our butter margins are increasing and the sales of butter products are increasing.""",A restructure of Guernsey's dairy industry may be needed after figures show full-cream milk sales were down by a quarter over the last decade.
"The Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA) is looking for ways of raising money to make 35% savings. One possible plan is to sell the North Lees Estate, which contains a large part of Stanage Edge in Derbyshire - a popular area for climbers and walkers. The authority said it would only sell the estate to the ""right organisation"". 'No compromises' The PDNPA's chief executive, Jim Dixon, said the North Lees Estate was ""very valuable"". ""It is worth an enormous amount to the nation for its landscape, wildlife and access - way more than its capital cash value. ""It's quite unlikely we will end up selling it - it's more likely we'll end up with a long-term lease. ""But I can absolutely guarantee that the decisions we make about the land in the national park will not compromise the access for the community or the conservation."" Henry Folkard, from the BMC, said if the North Lees Estate was sold and shooting rights restored - something which could be considered - access rights would be restricted. ""We're not opposed to the PDNPA raising money but it's the way they go about doing it - some ways are more appropriate than others. ""Anything that restricts access, we would resist strongly."" The PDNPA will meet later this month to discuss its plans.",The British Mountaineering Council (BMC) has started a petition over fears access rights could be restricted in the Peak District National Park.
"The social network said on Thursday that it valued shares at $38 (£24) each, and that its shares would begin trading in New York on Friday. At this price the eight-year-old firm would be worth $104bn (£66bn). Demand is set to be high; earlier this week Facebook said it would be selling 25% more shares than planned. I But questions remain about the firm's ability to generate profits and take advantage of mobile phone platforms. There are also concerns that once the company has to answer to shareholders, there may be a greater emphasis on advertising to generate profits. Limited say Earlier this week, the company indicated the price would be between $34-$38 a share, with about 421 million shares up for sale. This would represent one of the highest value share sales, or initial public offerings (IPOs) in US history. By selling shares at that value, Facebook raised $16bn for itself. However, the new shareholders will not have much of a say in how the company is run. The shares on offer are A shares, which carry one vote per share, whereas the current owners' shares are B shares, which carry 10 votes each. They will control more than 96% of the votes after the public listing, with founder Mark Zuckerberg holding just under 56% of the voting power of the company. Mr Zuckerberg, who owns about 25% of the company, stands to gain the most from taking Facebook public. Fellow founders Dustin Moskovitz and Eduardo Saverin will also become paper-billionares overnight, as will Napster founder and former employee Sean Parker. US venture capital firm Accel Partners and Russian internet investment group Digital Sky Technologies also hold significant stakes in Facebook, while Microsoft and U2 frontman Bono also stand to make a huge profit on their investment in the company. Revenue growth The social networking site has transformed the way in which hundreds of millions of people around the world communicate. It is also transforming the way companies advertise to existing and potential customers. But Facebook's 900 million users helped the company generate just $1bn in profit last year, and there are concerns about its ability to grow profits in the future. For while it holds a depth of personal information advertisers dream about, Facebook only generates about $5 a year per user. This has led a number of commentators to question the company's valuation. ""Facebook will need to generate annual revenue of $30bn-$40bn in order to justify the likely valuation of the business,"" said Victor Basta at Magister Advisors. ""This is a tenfold increase over the revenues that it currently generates. The question is 'where from?'"". The potential revenue from online advertising is huge. ""We know our industry is $1tn worldwide,"" Martin Sorrell, chief executive of advertising giant WPP, told the BBC. ""We know internet advertising is currently 20% roughly [of the total]. We know people are spending almost a third of their time online in one way or another, so there's a vast opportunity for Facebook."" Generating greater revenues from this potential market is the first key challenge facing the company, both in terms of its own business model and in the face of strong competition from the likes of Amazon, Apple and Google. ""We're telling our investors to hold off,"" Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, told the BBC. ""Number one, we don't know what the guts and the balance sheet of the company looks like yet so that's a big red flag for us. We want to understand the business before we tell people to invest."" 'Knife edge' Facebook has identified mobile devices, phones and tablet computers as key areas for revenue growth, but observers say this will not be easy. ""[Facebook is] the holy grail for advertisers. It holds the minutiae of everybody's lives, the perfect concoction of information - age, sex and what you like,"" technology analyst Ernest Doku told the BBC. ""[But] so many people are engaged for so long, it's very difficult to lure them away to what you're trying to sell them."" The second big challenge is not alienating users while trying to maximise revenue. ""[The company] is balancing on a knife edge between servicing its users and pleasing its investors,"" Mr Doku said. ""It has been able put the user experience first and foremost, but now investors are going to want [a return].""",Facebook has priced its shares ahead of one of the most eagerly-anticipated share flotations in recent stock market history.
"The figures, for the seven days up to 27 February, reveal around 1-in-230 people has the virus in the community. It suggests that the number infected has fallen by about a third in the most recent week of data. Infections have also dropped in the over 70s age group in England, potentially as a result of the vaccine rollout, say experts. The latest R number - 0.7 and 0.9 - suggests infection numbers are shrinking overall in the UK. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 7 and 9 other people. People are still being advised to take precautions to stop the spread. Low virus levels are needed to get the best out of the vaccination programme. It takes time for immunity to build after having a jab and protection may not be absolute even after two doses. People who are vaccinated may still be able to pass on the virus to others. High infection rates also give the virus more opportunities to mutate. Experts are already concerned about new and emerging variants that could evade some immunity from vaccination or prior infection. More than 20 million people across the UK have now received a first dose, with a target to invite all over-50s by mid-April and people in their 40s and 30s after that. Schools are reopening on Monday in England in the first easing of rules. It remains to be seen what effect this will have on infection rates. The ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest: Sarah Crofts from the ONS said: ""Infections continue to head in the right direction across the UK, with levels now similar to what we saw in early October and around a quarter of levels seen at the start of the year."" There is some regional variation, with the rate decreasing faster in some areas than others. The trend in the north-east England, the East Midlands and eastern England is uncertain, the ONS said. North-east England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus at around one in 150 people. The West Midlands had the next highest estimate, one in 160. The other estimates are: Prof Kevin McConway, Emeritus Professor of Applied Statistics with The Open University, said: ""Overall, the position is looking good. The virus hasn't gone away yet, and hasn't yet fallen to levels that we could live with in the longer term, in my view. But we're getting there, and we've got effective vaccines now.""

"By Althea Williams and Sarah Ehrlich BBC News In February 1943, 11-year-old Simon Gronowski was sitting down for breakfast with his mother and sister in their Brussels hiding place when two Gestapo agents burst in. They were taken to the Nazis' notorious headquarters on the prestigious Avenue Louise, used as a prison for Jews and torture chamber for members of the resistance. Today, Gronowski lives a two-minute walk from this building, where he was held for two nights without food or water. ""My parents had made a mistake - only one, but a serious one, which was… to have been born Jewish - a crime that, at the time, could only be punished by death,"" he says. From there, Simon and his mother and sister were transferred to the Kazerne Dossin, a detention camp 30 miles away in Mechelen, Flanders. ""People were randomly hit sometimes just for the crime of 'looking Jewish', so you had to keep a low profile,"" says Gronowski. ""For the smallest infraction, we could be beaten up and locked in a cell until we were deported. Sometimes they collectively punished the entire room of 100 of us, or make us stand in the courtyard for hours, day or night whatever the weather."" Most of the prisoners knew they would be deported but had no idea, Gronowski says, that they would be executed en masse. On 18 April, Simon and 1,630 others, including his mother, Chana, were informed they would be deported by train the next day. His father, Leon, had been in hospital when the Germans had raided their home a month before. His mother had quickly thought to tell them she was a widow. His older sister Ita - born in Belgium and already 18 - had Belgian citizenship and was therefore taken in a separate convoy. Simon, who like his parents and most of Belgium's Jewish population was stateless, remembers seeing her for the last time, crying and waving to him as they left. ""I didn't really understand what was going on and what deportation would mean. I was still in my own little world, where I was a boy scout,"" he says. ""I thought to myself, 'Goodbye my Brussels, my Belgium, my father, my dear sister, my family and my friends'."" Conditions inside the train were atrocious. ""We were packed like a herd of cattle. We had only one bucket for 50 people. How could we use it? How could we empty it? Besides, it would have been impossible to get to it,"" says Gronowski. ""There was no food, no drink. There were no seats so we either sat or lay down on the floor. I was in the rear right corner of the car, with my mother. It was very dark. There was a pale gleam coming from a vent in the roof but it was stifling and there was no water to be had."" Soon after leaving Mechelen, the 20th convoy was attacked by three young members of the Belgian Resistance armed with one pistol, red paper and a lantern. They made a red light, a sign for danger ahead, forcing the train driver to brake sharply. This was the first and only time during World War II that any Nazi transport carrying Jewish deportees was stopped. Robert Maistriau, one of the resistance members, recalled that terrifying moment later in his memoirs. ""The brakes made a hellish noise and at first I was petrified. But then I gave myself a jolt on the basis that if you have started something you should go through with it. I held my torch in my left hand and with my right, I had to busy myself with the pliers. I was very excited and it took far too long until I had cut through the wire that secured the bolts of the sliding door. I shone my torch into the carriage and pale and frightened faces stared back at me. I shouted Sortez Sortez! and then Schnell Schnell flehen Sie! Quick, Quick, get out of here!"" After a brief shooting battle between the German train guards and the three Resistance members, the train started again. Some had escaped from the opened wagon and the mood among the remaining deportees had changed. Those who had dreamed of escape suddenly become more determined and more desperate. An hour later, men in Simon's wagon succeeded in breaking open the door. Cool air flowed into the stifling, crowded carriage. Chana Gronowski gave her son a 100-franc note which he rolled and slid into his sock, then she pushed towards the door. Simon was too small to reach the footrail beneath the door by himself, so his mother lowered him down by his shoulders. ""My mother held me by my shirt and my shoulders. But at first, I did not dare to jump because the train was going too fast for me,"" he says. ""I saw the trees go by and the train was getting faster. The air was crisp and cool and the noise was deafening. I remember feeling surprised that it could go so fast with 35 cars being towed. But then at a certain moment, I felt the train slow down. I told my mother: 'Now I can jump.' She let me go and I jumped off. First I stood there frozen, I could see the train moving slowly forward - it was this large black mass in the dark, spewing steam."" But the train slowed to a stop for a second time that night and the German guards began shooting again, this time in Simon's direction. ""I wanted to go back to my mother but the Germans were coming down the track towards me. I didn't decide what to do, it was a reflex. I tumbled down a small slope and just started running for the trees."" Simon walked and ran all night, through woods and over fields. ""I was used to the woods because I'd been in the cub scouts. I hummed In the Mood to calm myself, which was a song my sister used to play on the piano,"" he says. Simon wanted to get to Brussels and his father, Leon. Simon knew he risked arrest but, by dawn, he knew that he would need help. With torn, muddy clothes, he knocked on a village door and told the woman who answered that he had been playing with friends and had got lost. At the time, Belgians who failed to turn in Jews to the Gestapo would be shot and the woman took Simon to the local police officer. For the first time, Simon was terrified. ""The sight of this man in his uniform with his gun in his belt, terrorised me. I was sure he would bring me back to the Germans. He asked me what had happened and I kept telling him that I had got lost and I was playing with children and that now, I had to go to Brussels."" The policeman, Jan Aerts had guessed Simon came from the Auschwitz convoy. The bodies of three escapees were lying in the police station at that very moment. However, Aerts had no intention of betraying Simon. His wife fed him and gave him clean clothes. Aerts arranged for Simon to catch a train back to Brussels where he arrived that evening. Simon was reunited that night with his father, a shopkeeper, although they spent the remaining years of the war hidden separately by Catholic families. Chana Gronowski was sent to the gas chambers on arrival at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Simon's sister Ita, 18, arrived in Auschwitz on the next but one convoy, and also died there. In all, 25,483 Jews and 351 Roma were deported from Kazerne Dossin. Of the 233 people who attempted to escape from the 20th convoy with Simon Gronowski, 26 were shot that night, 89 were recaptured and 118 got away. The 20th convoy was unique in that there was an attempt to rescue the deportees. It was unique in being the only convoy from which there was what could be called a mass breakout. According to some sources, it was also unique in that although 70% of the women and girls were killed in the gas chambers immediately on arrival, the remaining women were sent to Block X of Birkenau for medical experimentation. As for the three young Belgian Resistance members who stopped the train, Youra Livschitz was captured later and executed. Jean Franklemon was arrested soon after and sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he was freed in May 1945. He died in 1977. Robert Maistriau was arrested in March 1944. He was liberated from Bergen-Belsen in 1945 and lived until 2008. Jan Aerts was declared a ""Righteous Gentile"" by the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem. Leon Gronowski died within months of the end of the war. Simon Gronowski paid his way through university. He chose to be a lawyer because, he says, the Nazis had tried to dispossess and demean him, and he saw the law as the best way of countering that. Today he lives in Brussels and still practises law. He has children and grandchildren. He plays jazz. For more than 50 years he hardly spoke about his past but Maxime Steinberg, a Belgian historian and specialist in the persecution of Jews in Belgium, persuaded him to write a book. He now also speaks regularly in schools. ""I speak about what happened to me so that you will protect freedom in your country,"" he explains to children. ""I want you to know that the most important words are 'peace' and 'friendship'. I speak to bear witness, to combat anti-Semitism, all forms of discrimination and Holocaust denial; to honour the dead and the heroes who saved my life - Jan Aerts, who risked certain death in protecting me, the Catholic families who hid me during the war, and my mother, the first of my heroes."" Simon Gronowski's story, and those of many others, is also told in the new Kazerne Dossin Museum and Documentation Centre of the Holocaust and Human Rights, which opened in December. Built facing the actual transit centre - now an apartment block - the museum cost 25 million euros and was financed by the Flemish government. Its archives include 1,200 photos of the people on the 20th convoy.

There was mixed reaction to the new levy with some sweet on the idea, but others slightly more bitter. In the immediate hours after the Chancellor delivered his Budget, the hashtag #Budget2016 was tweeted an estimated 175,000 times, while the search term ""sugar tax"" was used around 14,000 times on the social media platform. Some referred to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Opposition response, where he welcomed Mr Osborne's sugar tax but said the Budget overall had ""unfairness at its core"". Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver - an exponent of healthier diets, particularly among children - quickly posted his reaction on Instagram which got over 40,000 likes. Again, the reaction in turn to the celebrity campaigner's tweet was both sweet and sour. Meanwhile, the exact sugary drinks to be affected became an issue in itself with some choosing to focus on the various - political and non-political - implications for the brands in question and their loyal customers. Many were also quick to notice the fact - crucially for some - that while a tax had been placed on sugary beverages, beer and cider duty were left alone, along with any levy on whisky and other spirits. Clearly an issue that affects all ages and lifestyles, then - regardless of their political persuasion. Compiled by Stephen Fottrell.",One of the major talking points following this year's Budget is the introduction of a new tax on sugary soft drinks to tackle childhood obesity.
"Lewis Bagshaw was stabbed twice in the chest during the attack in Piper Crescent, Sheffield, on 21 July 2019 before collapsing in a nearby garden. A jury heard how on the day he died he had challenged the four accused about an assault on his father linked to a row about drugs a few weeks earlier. All four deny murdering Mr Bagshaw. Nicki Humphrey, 42, Jervaise Bennett, 20, Callum Ramsey, 18, and a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, are on trial at Sheffield Crown Court. Prosecutor Nicholas Campbell QC said two of the accused, Mr Humphrey and the 17-year-old - a known drug dealer - had attacked Mr Bagshaw's father, Darren Cutts, in May 2019 in a row about £200 worth of crack cocaine, fracturing his skull. The barrister said on the day Mr Bagshaw died he had confronted the boy over the attack. Shortly after 22:00 BST that day, the boy, Mr Humphrey, Mr Bennett and Mr Ramsey, had met on Southey Avenue and driven to Piper Crescent where they saw Mr Bagshaw getting out of a car. Mr Campbell told jurors Mr Bagshaw was then attacked and chased into a nearby garden where he collapsed from his injuries. He later died in hospital. ""The prosecution can't say precisely where Lewis Bagshaw was when he was stabbed [and] there's no surviving witness to say who wielded the knife,"" he told jurors. ""[But] the prosecution case is that it's on the wider context of the evidence we can be sure that the intention of those who were chasing Lewis Bagshaw ... was to ensure that he was seriously injured."" Mr Humphrey, of Avenue Grove, Harrogate, Mr Bennett, of Bishopholme Close, Sheffield, Mr Ramsey, of Batworth Drive, Sheffield, and the 17-year-old boy, of no fixed abode, all deny murder. Mr Humphrey also denies a charge of causing GBH to Mr Cutts while the 17-year-old has pleaded guilty to the offence. The trial continues. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"Mont Cuet, a former granite quarry, has been a landfill site for 15 years and will be available to use until 2022. Currently gas created by the waste decomposing is collected by 27 gas wells and the gases, a mix of methane and carbon dioxide, are burnt off. The States is tendering for a contractor and hopes to have the equipment in place by the end of 2014. Mark Torode, senior manager for operations at States Works, said the gas produced by hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rotting waste at the site was of high quality. He said landfill was the ""least sustainable form of waste management but having anything that helps environmentally-wise is definitely a benefit"". Mr Torode said while he could not discuss the cost of installation during the tendering process, the States hoped to get a return on the investment within five years. Producing electricity from the gas is expected to last for 10 years. The States is investigating how to deal with the island's waste before the landfill site fills up, with its current preferred option being more recycling combined with exporting what is left.",Electricity generated from gas produced by Guernsey's landfill site could power 850 homes.
"Ahmed Sheikh had his sentence reduced to seven years for kidnapping by judges in Sindh High Court on Thursday. He had been on death row for the killing of Daniel Pearl since 2002. Sheikh's lawyers believed he would be free in ""days"", but Sindh officials ordered three more months' detention. A Sindh government official said they had concerns that Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and three other acquitted men, who were serving life sentences for their roles, may act ""against the interest of the country"". The law being used to detain the men in prison has previously been used to keep other high-profile militants detained, Reuters news agency reported. The decision came after the US's top diplomat for South Asia decried the acquittals as ""an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere'. What happened to Daniel Pearl? Pearl, who worked for the Wall Street Journal, went missing in January 2002. He had been researching links between Islamist militant activity in Karachi and Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a passenger plane using bombs hidden in his shoes. According to prosecutors, Sheikh lured him to a meeting with an Islamic cleric. The two had built a relationship discussing concerns about their wives, who were both pregnant at the time. Almost a month later, a video showing the 38-year-old's beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi. Pearl's son, Adam, was born in May 2002. Sheikh was convicted of Pearl's murder in July 2002 by an anti-terrorism court, and has been on death row since. Who is Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh? Sheikh was born in London in 1973, where he attended public school before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He did not graduate, failing to return after driving aid to Bosnia after his first year. He was arrested for being involved in the kidnapping of four tourists - three British and one American - in Delhi in 1994. He was released from prison as part of demands by militants who hijacked a plane in 1999. According to news agency Reuters, police in India later accused him of transferring money to one of the militants who flew a plane into the World Trade Center in New York on 9/11.",Pakistan officials are refusing to release the British-born militant found guilty of a US journalist's murder - despite judges throwing out his conviction.
"By Katherine Sellgren & Judith BurnsBBC News What do parents make of the government's ditching of a plan for all primary school years in England to go back to school for four weeks before the end of term? Jonathan Wills a parent from Barnton Primary in Northwich in Cheshire says families need to get back to some sort of routine. ""I think it's going to be extremely difficult for kids and some families, because it's a long time to try to recreate the structure that schools give you. ""And I think without that structure, a lot of schools and kids will struggle, particularly with the stresses of financial problems and then all the types of psychological problems. ""I think the kids that were struggling before will be struggling even more now."" Mother-of-two Victoria Rogers agrees: ""I do think children should start coming back to school, as we need to get back to some form of normality."" But elsewhere, mother-of-one Molly told the BBC she is relieved that not all primary years will be returning this term, as she would not have been prepared to send her daughter back to school. ""Until it is safe for parliament to sit next to each other and until it's 'safe' to cuddle your own blood mother, then how is it deemed safe to mix your children with numerous other households? ""But our children can be placed into school with numerous other households' children. Even at small groups of 15, how is that safe? When we are only allowed to meet up in groups of six? ""It's either dangerous to us all or it's not as dangerous as what they are making out. ""As much as my daughter needs to go back to school and the lockdown has taken its toll with her, I will not be sending her back. ""If it's this big killer, keeping us away from blood relatives, then it's not safe."" Divided opinions at home For some families, there is a difference of opinion even within the family. One mother-of-three - who was expecting two of hers to return to school before the summer - told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that her children had opposing views on the matter. ""I know that one of them is going to be really disappointed at the prospect of not seeing her friends. ""That's been something she's really counting down to, even though we knew it was uncertain. ""But the boy in Year 5 will be absolutely delighted!"" As for her, she remains ambivalent on it all: ""I feel sort of resigned to it really. I just feel sad for them that they're not going to see their friends for such a long time now."" Another mother told Today said she was ""unsurprised"" but ""incredibly disappointed"" by the news. ""I feel really sad for my son. I've got one son in year two, and another one in reception. ""My child in reception's gone back, albeit only four days a week, every other week. ""And my older son, who is just about to turn seven, is desperate to go back, can't understand, thinks it's so unfair - which it is. ""He and the school are going to have to put up with my rather inadequate home schooling, while I'm stuck at home, also with a one-and-a-half year old, trying to juggle a business and everything else."" But another mother, with two children aged eight and six, told Today she thought a return before the summer was too early. ""I'm actually relieved if schools don't go back until September because I think it's too soon. ""They don't socially distance at that age. I don't think there's enough protective equipment available in school."" However, for Nigel Rowlands, the past few weeks have been very difficult and he is glad to have his daughter back in school. ""It's been difficult - we've been through a lot. There's no structure, learning at home is entirely different to learning at school,"" he told the BBC. ""I've been working from home. So we've just spent a huge amount of time together, confined within four walls with not a lot of other places to go to. ""We try to get out and do a daily walk, but that's not the same as spending all day in school with other people. ""Having her back in school now has given some of that structure back and that's reflected in her being connected with other children and you can see that in that her demeanour is completely different since she's been back in school.""","Relief that children will be kept away from school for another few months, or despair that they are losing out on education and time with their friends?"
"The British Geological Survey report was commissioned to assess the potential reserves of fuel in Scotland. It estimates there are 80 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in central Scotland and six billion barrels of shale oil. That compares to 1,300 trillion cubic feet in the north of England and 4.4 billion barrels in the south. The amount of oil and gas which could be commercially recovered is expected to be ""substantially"" lower. The report says: ""The complex geology of the area and historic mine workings mean that exploratory drilling and testing is even more important to determine how much can be recovered."" Energy mix UK energy minister Michael Fallon said shale gas and oil reserves in central Scotland would not provide ""an energy bonanza"". Mr Fallon said: ""Making the most of Britain's home grown energy is crucial to keep job and business opportunities, widen tax revenues and reduce our reliance on foreign imports. ""We know that shale gas alone won't be able to supply all our energy needs, but the environmentally responsible exploration of shale gas could contribute to our energy mix."" He added: ""Only the broad shoulders of the United Kingdom can attract investment in new energy sources and maintain the UK's position as one of the world's great energy hubs - generating energy and generating jobs. ""The UK's energy security is among the best in the world, backed by a large consumer and tax base that can afford to support our world-leading energy industries and make us such an attractive place to invest."" Scottish energy minister Fergus Ewing said he would continue to consider fracking applications ""on their merits"". He added: ""Our responsible approach to the development of unconventional gas was confirmed in the Scottish planning policy published last week. ""It introduces rules to ensure that no operator can undertake hydraulic fracturing unless they first gain explicit planning consent for that activity."" Environmentalists have mounted a series of protests in England against the controversial ""fracking"" system of extracting shale gas and will campaign against any proposals to frack or drill in the central belt. WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: ""It's clear that there's not going to be a shale gas or oil bonanza in Scotland any time soon. ""While this study should change nothing about Scotland's aim to decarbonise its power sector and go fully renewable, in the wider interests of tackling climate change it's time for Scottish ministers to commit to start leaving some fossil fuels, including shale gas, in the ground. ""We already know our planet's climate can't afford the risk of burning the fossil fuels we already know about. So, to plan to find and burn even more should really be a non-starter. 'More drilling' ""Only last week it was revealed that Scotland is now generating record amounts of renewable electricity, while other studies have shown we could generate all of our electricity needs without the need for new fossil fuel burning. ""Whether it is shale gas, coal or oil, Scotland really needs to begin transitioning away from polluting fossil fuels."" Prof Mike Stephenson, director of science and technology at the British Geological Survey, said: ""The central estimate of shale gas in place is 80 trillion cubic feet and the central estimate for shale oil in place is six billion barrels. ""But reserves cannot be calculated at this stage before drilling and testing take place."" Green MSP Patrick Harvie said the results proved fracking ""has no place in Scotland's energy future."" He said: ""This study puts paid to all the hype we've been fed about a shale bonanza."" Tom Greatrex, Scottish Labour's shadow energy minister said: ""Shale should not be presented as a silver bullet - rather a potential contributor to where we source the gas eight in 10 of us use for heating."" Scottish Conservative energy spokesman Murdo Fraser called for more drilling and testing to establish Scotland's shale potential. He said: ""If we are sitting on billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas, it's essential we at least check it out.""","Scotland has only a ""modest amount"" of shale gas and oil, according to a new study."
"The men were about 10 miles (16.5km) off France when French authorities spotted them after midnight. the Prefecture Maritime de la Manche said. Border Force officials brought the group ashore at Dover. Forty migrants, including two children, were rescued on Christmas Day. The Home Office has blamed organised crime, but Dover's MP has demanded action. Coastguards said they were not involved in the latest incident on Boxing Day. Forty migrants in Christmas Day rescues Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? A Home Office spokesman said: ""Evidence shows there is organised criminal gang activity behind illegal migration attempts by small boats across the Channel. ""We are working closely with the French and law enforcement partners to target these gangs, who exploit vulnerable people and put lives at risk."" The Home Office said the three rescued by French teams overnight were transferred to UK authorities and brought to Dover. The group, who presented themselves as Iranian, were medically assessed and passed to immigration officials, the spokesman said. Those rescued on Christmas Day presented themselves as Iraqi, Iranian and Afghan. 'Incredibly dangerous' Dover's Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has said the Home Office and National Crime Agency ""do not appear to be on top of this situation"". He said: ""With well over 100 migrants having broken into Britain in recent weeks they need urgently to explain what they are doing to put a stop to these crossings. ""This is an incredibly dangerous crossing to make in the middle of winter. ""Our volunteer lifeboat crews are being called out nearly every day - even during Christmas. ""The British and French authorities must get a grip and find and stop the traffickers behind these crossings before there is a tragedy in the English Channel."" A statement from the French authorities also warned migrants planning to cross the the Dover-Calais strait - the world's busiest shipping lane - they were endangering lives. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",Three migrants spotted in a small boat in the Channel have been brought ashore by the Border Force.
"By John CampbellBBC NI economics & business editor The survey of 350 firms also suggested that about that 75% of them anticipate business growth in 2014, albeit at a modest rate for the majority. The services sector looks like being the main engine of job growth. In the last quarter of 2013, recruitment intentions in services increasingly translated into actual jobs, though seasonal recruitment will have played a part. Some firms are also reporting difficulties in finding suitably skilled and experienced staff for the positions they wish to fill. The survey showed that about half of manufacturers trying to recruit are experiencing difficulties, particularly in relation to skilled manual workers. Interest rates are increasingly emerging as a concern for businesses, though most economists do not believe they will rise from their historically low rates until 2015. Ann McGregor, chief executive of NI Chamber of Commerce, said the results suggest the economic recovery ""gathered pace"" over the past three months and businesses are generally more confident about the future. Francis Martin, from business consultants BDO which helped compile the survey, said that while confidence was definitely improving some of the issues in the survey matched concerns of his clients. ""Ongoing recruitment issues and potential skills gap, the increasing pressure on businesses to raise prices and fundamental cash flow issues continue to be a concern and a barrier to growth,"" he said.","More than half of businesses in Northern Ireland intend to take on new staff in 2014, a survey by the Chamber of Commerce has suggested."
"By Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent, BBC News Papers have been lodged at the High Court by a mother and a nurse against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the UK's only gender-identity development service (Gids). Lawyers will argue it is illegal to prescribe the drugs, as children cannot give informed consent to the treatment. The Tavistock said it had a ""cautious and considered"" approach to treatment. Papers were formally lodged on Wednesday by the lawyers for the complainants. The Tavistock will have three weeks to submit its response, after which a judge will consider the case and decide on the timings of any hearings. Referrals up The nurse, Sue Evans, left the Gids more than a decade ago after becoming increasingly concerned teenagers who wanted to transition to a different gender were being given the puberty blockers without adequate assessments and psychological work. Since then, she says, even younger children are being given the drugs, which block the hormones that lead to puberty-related changes including periods and facial hair. The number of young people referred to the Gids rose from 678 in 2014-15 to 2,590 in the past year. Of these 2,590: Ms Evans said: ""I used to feel concerned it was being given to 16-year-olds. ""But now, the age limit has been lowered - and children as young as perhaps nine or 10 are being asked to give informed consent to a completely experimental treatment for which the long-term consequences are not known."" 'Too young' The mother, known only as Mrs A, has a 15-year-old with autism who is on the waiting list for treatment at the Gids. She told BBC News her child presents to the outside world as a boy but, while she is happy to allow that, she is extremely concerned about the possibility of drugs that are not fully understood being prescribed. ""I'm worried that they will look at her age and say, 'Well, she still says this is what she wants and therefore we will put her on to a medical pathway,'"" Mrs A told BBC News. ""And given her communication of what she feels internally is slightly different because of her autism spectrum, I worry that what she says and what she means are often two different things."" What are puberty blockers? They are drugs which can pause the development of things like breasts, periods, facial hair and voice breaking They can be prescribed to children with gender dysphoria who feel their sex at birth doesn't match up with their gender. This is meant to give them more time to weigh up their options before they go through the physical changes of puberty. Although puberty blockers are described by the NHS as reversible, Gids acknowledges that their impact on brain development and psychological health is not fully known. Read more: What are puberty blockers? Mrs A said her child was too young to really assess the potential impact of puberty blockers on the rest of their life, including such things as fertility. ""As an adolescent, what we think will make us happy is not necessarily what will make us happy,"" she told BBC News. ""It might help us in the short term - but it might not help us in the long term."" 'Rated good' A Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust official said: ""It is not appropriate for us to comment in detail in advance of any proposed legal proceedings. ""The Gids is one of the longest-established services of its type in the world with an international reputation for being cautious and considered. ""Our clinical interventions are laid out in nationally set service specifications. ""NHS England monitors our service very closely. ""The service has a high level of reported satisfaction and was rated good by the Care Quality Commission.""",Legal action is being launched against the NHS over the prescribing of drugs to delay puberty.
"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons. A few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head. Carrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election. Eyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front. Faizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital. ""I knew he was gone,"" Zarifa told me. A heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead. Faizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest ""martyr"". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan. Faizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day. Five things to know about Kashmir The voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties. The soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with ""protests and provocation"" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me. One report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds. Separatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the ""anti-people"" agenda of the Indian government. Disillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away. Why Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear. By all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire. Whatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy. A picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - ""he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,"" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera. ""He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,"" a cousin told me, when I visited the family. Grief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn. ""My son, my son, where will I find you now?"" she cried, again and again. Then she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains. ""The blood of a martyr never goes waste,"" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. ""One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule]."" A brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy. ""I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit."" Outside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness. They said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because ""they are our brothers and don't kill civilians"" and are ""fighting for freedom"". More than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces. ""We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,"" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk. Since February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape. The army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments. Recently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army. ""Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,"" an army officer told me. The region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with the security forces during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley. Kashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule. Many say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated. Militancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s. But young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of ""becoming irrelevant"", as a leader of an opposition party told me. ""This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,"" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher. ""India needs to be worried, very worried about this.""","The day 12-year-old Faizan Fayaz Dar died, he woke up in the morning in his hilltop home in Budgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, had a cup of salted tea, recited the Koran and pottered around in the kitchen where his mother prepared breakfast for the family."
"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent, BBC News Simon Stevens suggested he wanted to see a European model of ""generalists"" adopted to work alongside specialists. He told a conference of health managers that the rise in multiple conditions required greater co-ordination of care. The speech builds on comments he made last week about ensuring there was a role for smaller hospitals in the NHS. In recent years there has been a focus on creating larger, specialist hospitals. But Mr Stevens said that while that was desirable in areas such as stroke care, smaller hospitals still had an important role to play. Mr Stevens said the large expansion in consultant numbers - up by three-quarters since 2000 - had led to more and more specialisation by consultants. He told the NHS Confederation's annual conference that while this was desirable it had sometimes ""fragmented care for older inpatients"". He said: ""One study has found that using single condition-specific guidelines a 79-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, hypertension respiratory problems, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis could be prescribed 19 doses of conflicting and adversely interacting medicines each day."" Having general physicians - or hospitalists, as they are sometimes known - is commonplace in countries such as Sweden and Germany. The call for this model of medicine mirrors one that was made last year by the Royal College of Physicians. Mr Stevens also set out other steps he wanted to take. These included reform of the funding system for hospitals to take more into account the outcomes they achieve for patients. At the moment, funding is largely based on throughput of patients. But he told the conference in Liverpool that it was important that local areas came up with their own solutions rather than relying on a one-size-fits-all approach. He said the coming years were a ""defining moment"" in the history of the NHS. ""I know there are enormous pressures, but the NHS is up for change and necessity truly is the mother of invention."" Mr Stevens replaced Sir David Nicholson as NHS England's chief executive in April.","The care of frail elderly patients has become fragmented because of the drive for hospital doctors to specialise, the new boss of NHS England says."
"Ursula Myrie organised Breaking the Cycle of Abuse in Sheffield because she said the subject was ""taboo"" in many black families. She also made a film on the issue as part of Black History Month. In December, the government said the Mental Health Act should be rewritten to better represent black and ethnic minority (BME) communities. Ms Myrie grew up in care homes in London in the 1980s and was relocated to Sheffield in the 1990s because of domestic abuse. ""Mental health issues are seen as a white man's problem,"" she said. ""It's juju, voodoo, but meanwhile we're over-represented in mental health wards and prisons."" More Yorkshire stories In the film, which will be shown as part of the campaign at a conference on Saturday, people from BME communities discuss family, gender and institutions. Student Hayden Barrows-Gayle said mental health was ""not even [seen as] a real thing in many communities,"" adding: ""You're either crazy or you're lazy."" Black rights activist Zara Adeyemi said the stereotype of the ""ridiculously strong"" black person has led to mental health problems. ""Men and women in the black community now can't be open about our true feelings and emotions,"" she said. ""Talking about issues in your life is not weakness"". More on Black History Month: Ms Myrie is one of hundreds offered compensation by Lambeth Council because she was placed in Shirley Oaks children's home in Croydon in the 1980s, which became notorious for its links with a paedophile ring. She said abuse she experienced as a child meant she was in and out of psychiatric units all her life so she started a black women's support group in Sheffield called Adira. ""Abuse in the black community is still perpetrated, why do we not talk about the real root causes?"" Ms Myrie said. ""I need to recycle this pain, to change the culture."" NHS figures have shown nearly twice as many white British people accessed mental health support, yet BME women are most likely to have a mental condition. Psychotherapist Angela Barrows said the ""cycle"" of mental health problems and abuse must stop. ""It was only when my mum told me what my grandmother experienced in Panama, Jamaica then Britain that I realised three generations in my family have gone through their own mental health experiences,"" she said.

"Glassheart was originally set to go on sale in November 2011. It was then pushed back to spring 2012 but now it's been confirmed it will be even later in the year. A spokeswoman for the east London singer couldn't confirm a date but online retailer Amazon now lists Glassheart's sale date as 26 November 2012. Last month, in an interview with Newsbeat, she denied that a recorded album was scrapped. She said her introduction to producer Fraser T Smith meant she wanted to might some more music with him for the release. Recorded in Sweden, LA and New York she said she ""wasn't disappointed"" that the album's release got pushed back.

"The child, who was inside the property on Chatham Road, Northfield, was treated for minor injuries at the scene following the crash at about 07:15 BST. His mother said she panicked as she could not initially reach her son after there was a loud bang and a cloud of dust as they were walking downstairs. The van driver was also treated for minor injuries and has been taken to hospital. According to the family, who did not want to be identified, the van crashed through the front door and the porch before coming to rest in the property's hallway. Another child, who had been upstairs at the time, and the woman's partner walked out of the house unscathed. West Midlands Fire Service said gas and power would need isolating and a structural engineer had been called to assess the damage to the property. A specialist unit has been at the house to reinforce the structure, it added. The housing association which owns the property is providing temporary accommodation for the occupants. Jack Kelly, from Midland Heart, said: ""What we've done is made sure that they've got somewhere tonight and for the next few nights while we assess exactly what's going to have to happen.

"Craig Lindley, 35, from Barnsley, did not have travel insurance when he was paralysed by Guillain-Barré syndrome, a rare illness of the nervous system. His friends raised £32,000 for his treatment via an online appeal. Mr Lindley was staying on a Thai island to celebrate a friend's wedding. His brother, Karl, said he collapsed on New Year's Day morning. ""He woke up, went on to his balcony and collapsed, he couldn't feel his legs,"" said Karl. Guillain-Barré syndrome affects the peripheral nervous system and affects about 1,200 people in the UK every year. Mr Lindley was paralysed from head to toe, excluding his left arm. Speedboat costs His brother said the ambulance and speedboat from the island to Koh Samui Hospital in Bangkok cost £17,000, plus hospital bills of £3,000 a day. Mr Lindley is originally from Hoyle Mill but had been travelling for five years. He had a five-day course of treatment for the condition, at a cost of £20,000, before being flown home to the UK. Craig said doctors were amazed by his recovery, and that his friends and medical staff had been ""incredible"". They raised £31,733 via the online appeal after discovering Mr Lindley had no valid travel insurance in his documents. ""My friends never bothered me about the financial side - they just let me get better,"" he said. ""On the second day of treatment I started to feel a positive change. I was paralysed from the top of my head to my toes but I was confident and strong that I would get through this and I would be home soon.""","A man whose medical bills rocketed above £20,000 when he fell seriously ill in Thailand on New Year's Day has returned home to South Yorkshire."
"Cho Hyun-min, 36, a Korean Air senior vice-president, also reportedly splashed water in a colleague's face. She said she had been ""foolish and reckless"", but a spokesperson for the airline denied the latter accusation. She is the younger sister of Cho Hyun-ah - the airline heiress who infamously delayed a flight over a packet of nuts. The antics of wealthy business families in South Korea often make headlines. According to local media reports, Ms Cho, who is also known as Emily, lost her temper because she was unhappy with answers to her questions during a meeting. She issued an apology for the incident on her Facebook page on Thursday. ""I apologise with my head down for my foolish and reckless behaviour,"" she said. ""I have no words to say for my action that I should not have done under any circumstances."" An airline spokesman denied water was thrown at an employee during the incident. ""During the meeting, she thought the manager's answer was not sufficient, so she threw a water bottle on the floor, not at the manager's face,"" the spokesman told Reuters news agency. The new incident has caused South Koreans to complain about the family again - making them trend on Twitter. The owners of Korean Air have been under intense scrutiny since Ms Cho's sister, who is also known as Heather, famously flew into a rage when macadamia nuts were served to her in a bag and not on a plate on a Seoul-bound flight from New York in December 2014. The case attracted intense attention in South Korea, reopening a national debate about the Korean business system, which is dominated by family firms known as chaebols. The incident was eventually brought to trial, and Cho Hyun-ah was convicted of violating aviation safety, coercion and abuse of power in 2015. An appeals court later reduced the sentence to a suspended term, and she recently returned to a management role at the firm's hotel wing.",The youngest daughter of the CEO of Korean Air has apologised after allegedly throwing a bottle of water at a wall during a company meeting.
"Britain's beaches are increasingly facing some unusual visitors, with research suggesting jellyfish numbers are on the increase in UK waters. It's not only beach-goers who have to watch out. Torness nuclear power plant in Scotland recently had to shut down after moon jellyfish blocked the water intake system. Several tonnes of the creatures had to be cleared out. Some areas, including the Irish Sea and the east coast of Scotland, have been invaded by so many they now resemble a ""jellyfish soup"", says the Marine Conservation Society (MCS). So why do they appear to be on the increase? According to research there is strong evidence that an increase is linked to three main factors - pollution, overfishing and possibly climate change. Pollution such as sewage and fertilisers run off the land and into the sea, causing increased nutrients in the water. This can boost jellyfish numbers as the nutrients increase plankton which they feed on, along with fish. Overfishing means jellyfish do not face their usual predators and competitors, which usually regulate population growth. Large fish, which eat jellyfish, have been drastically reduced by bad fishing practices, says Ocean 2012, a pressure group which campaigns to stop overfishing. So have smaller fish which compete for food with the stingers. It is argued that climate change can cause more favourable conditions for jellyfish, with their adaptability giving them an advantage over some other sea creatures. Huge blooms It is difficult to estimate the jellyfish population in UK waters because very little research has been done and in the past they were ignored in long-term fishing surveys, says Dr Victoria Hobson, from EcoJel, a project researching the distribution and abundance of jellyfish. Its current study has been running since 2008. ""This also makes it difficult to get a handle on how numbers have changed,"" she says. ""Even in recent years people are doing a lot more watersports so are spotting more. ""With the development of smartphones it is also much easier to report those sightings. It makes it difficult to interpret if there are actually more jellyfish or just more sightings."" The MCS has been running a national jellyfish survey since 2003, where the public report sightings. Dr Richardson agrees it's probably too early to draw any firm conclusions from the data, but says a few other organisations have been doing systematic at-seas surveys over recent decades and they have shown a rise in jellyfish numbers in UK waters. ""Our survey reflects that,"" he says. ""Some of the people who have been reporting jellyfish to us say they have lived by the coast for years and never seen anything like it. ""This year we received our first reports of the huge but harmless barrel jellyfish off north Wales back in early January. This species has occurred in huge numbers in the Irish Sea and beyond ever since, with reports received from north Somerset to the Firth of Clyde."" There are hundreds of types of jellyfish, with a few common species in the UK. These include the moon jellyfish, which can grow to the size of a saucer, and the barrel jellyfish, which can get as big as a large household dustbin. Some do sting, but in most cases it causes just a mild rash. The occasional Portuguese man o'war has been spotted in UK waters and its sting is far more serious. Economic impact A group of jellyfish is called a ""bloom"". Scientists say it is difficult to measure blooms because of the sheer numbers involved and the fact jellyfish spend time at depth, as well as on the surface. But a bloom of barrel jellyfish can cover an area the size of Carmarthen Bay in Wales and numbers can run into hundreds of thousands, says Dr Hobson. EcoJel's project involves tagging jellyfish to study their movements. Monitoring jellyfish numbers is important because they are an indication of the state of oceans. If they overtake fish and start to dominate an area - as they have off the coast of Namibia - this causes environmental and economic problems, says Dr Hobson. In 2007 a jellyfish invasion wiped out Northern Ireland's only salmon farm, killing more than 100,000 fish. At the time a spokesman said the attack could cost the company more than £1m. They can also have an impact on tourism. In 2008 the Red Cross treated 400 people for jellyfish stings in a single day on a beach in Malaga, Spain. But one consequence to come from the growing numbers is increased sightings of leatherback sea turtles, which feed on them, in UK waters. Dr Richards says there has been an unusually high number of sighting in 2011 - six in six days recently. ""That's an amazing number, it's definitely a good year for turtles.""","Jellyfish numbers appear to be on the rise in UK waters, research suggests. So why is the sea turning into ""jellyfish soup""?"
"By Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent A commission was set up after Welsh ministers scrapped plans to build a £1.6bn relief road around Newport. To encourage people out of their cars, its report suggested considering a ""workplace parking levy"" and ensuring public transport was ""affordable for all"". The panel was told not to consider plans for another motorway. The M4 around Newport is the fourth most congested stretch of road in the UK. The South East Wales Transport Commission recommended tripling the number of train stations between Cardiff and the River Severn, from three to nine, as well as establishing bus and cycle route networks in Newport. If all the recommendations were acted on, it suggested more than 90% of people in Cardiff and Newport would live ""within one mile of a rail station or rapid bus corridor"". The report recommended better integration and coordination of rail and bus networks and integrated tickets across all services. Services should run every 15 minutes and stations should be more accessible on foot and for cyclists. Currently, common M4 journeys are poorly served by public transport alternatives, it said, with Newport served particularly poorly by rail. It said ""flexible office hubs"" should be established in major towns and cities, in order to support remote working. Although most M4 journeys cannot be substituted by walking or cycling because of their distance, the report said active travel had ""a key role"". The commission suggested making walking or cycling the ""natural choice"" for the first and last mile of public transport journeys and recommend establishing ""a major cycleway"" linking Cardiff and Newport. Although travel habits have changed due to Covid-19, the report said those changes ""do not fundamentally alter"" the need for more transport options and claimed the pandemic provided ""an opportunity to prepare significant transport improvements while demand is reduced"". A 20% reduction in flow on the M4 would have a significant positive impact on journey times, it said. The commission, chaired by Lord Burns, described its recommendations as ""ambitious yet achievable"". It said its ""fast track"" recommendations - made in a progress update in December 2019 - were ""consistent"" with their final recommendations. This included the introduction of a 50mph average speed control and more lane guidance on the westbound approach to the Brynglas tunnels in Newport. The report said the cost of the recommendations would be between £600m and £800m: At peak times, between 3,000 and 5,000 vehicles approach the Brynglas tunnels every hour. Alleviating congestion on the M4 by moving commuters and travellers on to public transport would benefit goods and services traffic which are less able to switch to other modes of transport, according to the report. First Minister Mark Drakeford scrapped plans to build a £1.6bn relief road last year after declaring a climate emergency because of its environmental impact, as well as the effect on the public purse. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said in October the UK government had not ruled out bypassing the Welsh Government to build to road. The commission said in principle it was in favour of road charging, but was not recommending this due to the absence of a UK-wide scheme, but said it should be considered again in future. The UK government said it continued to believe that a relief road remained the ""most viable solution to the ongoing congestion problems"" around Newport. A spokesman added: ""The report is welcome and highlights the undoubted necessity for improvements in south Wales' transport infrastructure. ""The need to make improvements for people using the road and rail network is why the UK government launched its Union Connectivity Review last month.""","£800m should be invested in public transport to help ease traffic jams on the M4, a report has recommended."
"The legendary London club has been shut down after recent deaths blamed on a ""culture of drugs"". The end of Fabric follows a wave of club closures with nearly half the UK's nightclubs shutting their doors in just 10 years. Fabric launched in 1999 and over its 17-year life became an iconic venue for dance music - from house to drum and bass. Anyone who's ever been clubbing there will see for themselves how different it looks now the party is over. On Tuesday night Radio 1 Newsbeat hosted a discussion from its deserted premises. Saul Milton from Chase and Status said that drug laws in the UK needed to be looked at because venues shouldn't be ""in trouble"" for the actions of individuals. Alice Woods, a club promoter in the north of England, said the emotion around the closure had been felt across the UK. It's about ""saving a culture"" not just Fabric itself, she added. Simon Roberts tweeted that ""Fabric was unfortunately the beacon for drug use"". But Bill Brewster, one of Fabric's first resident DJs, thinks authorities in London need to ""rethink their drugs policy"" and be ""sensible"" about club life. Ollie Beavis tweeted that ""half the reason I started DJing was to play Fabric"". He added that ""it's like Wembley closing for a young footballer"". Police say they're willing to ""enter a dialogue"" with club owners and the government about new rules around clubbing.

"The survey will collect data on the number of people living in the island, as well as their age, sex, ethnicity, education, and employment. States members have agreed to include four additional questions on health, disability, sexuality and gender. Statistics Jersey will anonymise and analyse the data, before publishing the results. Islanders will be asked to submit their information on 21 March via forms sent to each household by the government. While the health and disability questions will be mandatory, those relating to an individual's sexual orientation and gender identity will be optional. The census is expected to cost the government £700,000, which will include the recruitment of 35 temporary staff to assist with the project. Officials said it would help to plan for future services, including housing, education and transport. They added data security would be the government's ""foremost priority"". Jersey's last census, completed in 2011, calculated the island's population at 97,857.","Jersey will take its next census in March 2021, the States Assembly has agreed."
"By Louise WilsonBBC Holyrood Live The Referendums Bill aims to put in place a generic framework for all future referendums. But scrutiny has focused on question testing for indyref2 and the powers ministers would have over such a vote. Holyrood's constitution committee last week urged ministers to strike a deal with the Electoral Commission over testing the question. It also recommended primary legislation should be required for any referendum on a constitutional issue. What else is happening at Holyrood this week? Tuesday - Euro 2020 The bulk of Tuesday afternoon will be spent on the legislation to allow four Euro 2020 matches to take place at Hampden Park. It includes measures to prevent ticket touting and unauthorised street trading. To that end it will create four new offences, all of which largely model those introduced ahead of the Commonwealth Games in 2014. Before that topical questions will be on drug consumption rooms, prison officers quitting after sick-leave and a call for more support for families of people who die abroad. Green MSP Ross Greer leads the evening's member's debate on Flamingo Land withdrawing its planning application to build a £30m tourist resort on Loch Lomond. In the morning, the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform Committee will take evidence from the Committee on Climate Change. The session will focus on the government's climate change adaptation programme, in light of the newer, tougher targets. The committee will also discuss investment priorities for Scottish Water.

"By Peter FrayEditor, PolitiFact Australia As it dawns on her what's happened - guilty - she breaks down, her palms press hard up against her bowed forehead. Then, quaking, red-faced, palms out in Buddha fashion, she turns to her equally confused, soon-to-be apoplectic family: ""Mum, it's OK."" But it isn't. And it won't be for a long time. This is how, almost nine years ago, millions of Australians witnessed live on TV Schapelle Corby make the descent from one-time Gold Coast beauty student to convicted drug smuggler, sentenced to 20 years in an Indonesian jail for importing 4.1kg of marijuana in a boogie board bag. Those few minutes, her confusion giving away to terror, are burnt into the nation's memory. Ever since, Corby, now 36, has lived out her term in Bali's Kerobokan prison in quasi-public - her blue eyes and arched eyebrows often staring out from behind bars or her body squeezed between prison officials on the way to court. Protesting her innocence and claiming the drugs were planted, Corby has gone from arrest (in Oct 2004), trial (Jan 2005), conviction (May 2005), appeal (2006), appeal rejected (March 2008), a presidential clemency requested (April 2010), clemency granted (May 2012), application for parole (Oct 2013) and now parole signed and delivered. With time in jail offset with remissions for good behaviour, she will have served more than nine years and be free to return to Australia after serving out her parole at her sister Mercedes's house in the backstreets of Kuta, Bali's party district. She is not expected to be free to leave the country until 2017. Lurid headlines The exhaustive legal process, at times a burr in the side of Australian-Indonesian relations, has at times seemed more like the macguffin to the real plot: the raw, sensational and hotly-contested journey of an Aussie surfie chick trying to survive in a crowded Asian prison. This has played out in supermarket magazines (in a series of content deals with the Corby family), books (including her own), tabloid TV shows and tele-movies, the latest of which is due to air across Australia on Monday night. In the court of public opinion, Schapelle, as she is simply known, has been at various times seen as an innocent duped and then trapped in an uncaring, harsh country or a willing drug mule of her late father, Mick Corby, who, according to journalist and author Eamonn Duff, was part of a marijuana smuggling syndicate. Corby senior, who died in 2008, denied any knowledge of the drugs found on his daughter. Asked if she's guilty or not, Duff, whose book, Sins of the Father, informs the new tele-movie, replies: ""absolutely guilty"". But he has sympathy for her ""years lost"". ""It's a massive chunk of your life,"" he says. Not since Lindy Chamberlain, jailed and eventually acquitted of killing her own daughter, Azaria, in 1980, has there been a more divisive female Australian inmate nor such a feast of lurid headlines, allegations and political pressure points. Much of it has been pure tabloid. There has been Schapelle's prison baby (untrue), her fight against depression, possible suicide attempts, doubts about her sanity, a song to bring her home - to the tune of John Lennon's Happy Xmas (War is Over) - petitions to do the same, and, in one of the most bizarre episodes, a push by her mother, the feisty fish and chip operator Rosleigh Rose, to swap herself for her daughter in prison. ""My daughter is innocent, I'm an innocent person too, so why shouldn't I be able to take her place for a crime she never committed?"" she told Woman's Day magazine in September 2009. But there has been a deeper, more serious side. Successive Australian prime ministers have been pressured to intervene and the former premier of Queensland, Anna Bligh, offered to bring her home. More recently, the recent revelations that Australia spied on Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in 2009 have reportedly set back Corby's release. But Ross Taylor, the chairman of Perth-based Indonesia Institute, a think-tank that aims to foster relations between the two countries, argues that politics has played little role in the travails of Corby, especially not now with the Indonesian election season fast approaching. ""The starship Indonesia is at best on auto pilot because the crew is out the back working out who is going to fly the plane and where it's going to land,"" he says. 'Enormous interest' Where consensus can perhaps be found is on the length of her sentence: many Australians believe it was too long. A poll in May 2012, in Fairfax Media, found 43% in favour of her gaining clemency, even though 60% of those surveyed agreed she was guilty as charged. There is a sense in Australia that Corby, irrespective of her guilt, has been treated harshly - or could have been treated with more leniency - because she is an Australian. Around the time of her conviction her sentence was compared with the 2.5 years given by Indonesian courts to Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Islamic cleric found guilty of conspiracy in relation to the 2002 Bali bombing that killed 200 people, including 88 Australians. This argument ignores the fact that three of the actual bombers were killed by firing squad, albeit in 2008, three years after Corby was sent down. It also sidesteps the well-known fact that Indonesian authorities, from the president down, employ a zero tolerance approach to drug importers. When Corby was first arrested it was reported she could receive a death sentence. With Corby free, the burning question is will she sell her story? How much will it cost? And will she tell the truth, the whole truth? Speculation, informed by past celebrity deals, is that she'll be worth A$3m ($2.7m, £1.6m) to a commercial TV channel with magazine and book add-ons. Though unable to nominate a sum, the network news director of Channel 7, Rob Raschke, says: ""I think it is very hard to overstate her currency as a story. Enormous interest."" Celebrity agent Max Markson, who is not representing Corby, argues Schapelle's story will keep giving. ""She's so controversial: half the public think she's guilty, half the public think she's innocent. There will be stories galore coming out."" Indeed. But, as Duff suggests, Corby's answers may not satisfy the public. ""People want some serious questions answered after all this time,"" he says. ""They want some proper questions answered."" And what if the stories of her depression and questions about her sanity are in fact true, even though she's reportedly looking forward to some unsurprising and pretty sane comforts: clean sheets, a swim and a beer with mates. Hounded by sections of the media and holed up in her sister's compound, is Schapelle Corby about to swap one prison in Bali for another? Peter Fray is the editor-in-chief and founder of the political fact-checking site, PolitiFact Australia, an adjunct professor at Sydney University and the former editor-in-chief of the Sydney Morning Herald.","She is standing, shaking, dumfounded, looking around for a friendly face, angry and crying. Her white skin and western clothes — black top, light pink pants — contrast with the brown skin and uniforms of police and court officials."
"The new feature called ""fleets"" is similar to vanishing posts on Snapchat and Instagram Stories. The changes prompted the hashtag #RIPTwitter to trend as users complained the new feature would make the micro-blogging site too similar to other social media platforms. So far Twitter is only testing the function in Brazil. Kayvon Beykpour, the company's product lead, said the new feature would allow people to post thoughts they might have felt uncomfortable sharing publicly. He said posting on Twitter can feel ""permanent and performative"" which can intimidate some users. ""We're hoping that Fleets can help people share the fleeting thoughts that they would have been unlikely to Tweet,"" he wrote in a seven-part post on Twitter. The vanishing messages will appear when a user's profile picture is clicked. Users will not be able to reply, like, or publicly comment on any of the disappearing messages. Some Twitter users made plain their reservations. Mr Beykpour acknowledged that Fleets did sound a lot like the Stories features from Facebook and Instagram. He said Twitter was making a ""few intentional differences"" to its version. The company did not say when Fleets would be rolled out globally.","Twitter is testing a feature that will allow some tweets to disappear after 24 hours, it announced on Wednesday."
"It follows a meeting between the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and council officials to discuss possible action to support people in flood-hit Somerset. On Wednesday Owen Paterson announced amphibious vehicles could be deployed to help flood victims within 24 hours. But Pat Flaherty, council deputy chief executive, said the military would ""remain in Somerset"" on stand-by. At a news conference earlier, Mr Flaherty said the military had ""come in at short notice"" and had been working with council teams ""to assess and plan for what is required"". ""The fire service has met that need through its national specialist vehicles and trained staff,"" he said. But he added with the ""potential for high winds and high tides and more rain"" over the weekend on an ""already soaked catchment"" there was potential for further flooding. ""With that in mind we're still working very closely with the military who remain in Somerset, planning with us,"" he said. ""We also have the resilience of knowing that their equipment and personnel are ready to be mobilised should we require them."" 'Contingency plan' The Devon and Somerset Fire Service now has 10 high-volume pumps on stand-by in a ""strategic holding area"" and use of high-axle 4x4 vehicles as well as access to two hovercraft. And Chief Supt Caroline Peters, from Avon and Somerset Police, said she was confident the civil authorities could manage. ""The military have been able to come in, with the support of the fire service, and put in place contingency plans so that we are able to respond,"" she said. ""At this stage though, we are very comfortable with the civil contingencies that we have in place and the resources we have, we can manage this."" Another meeting of Cobra, the government's emergency response committee, was convened earlier chaired by the environment secretary. Following the meeting, Mr Paterson said the council had been ""very grateful"" for the ""logistics help"" and ""help with some specialist vehicles"" given ""The military are on standby as sadly there is a spell of bad weather coming in and they may be needed for further activities,"" he said. '100 Military personnel' Earlier, the MoD said up to 100 military personnel, the majority from Taunton-based 40 Commando, were on standby. And routes that could potentially be used by vehicles were being ""reconnoitred"" and tested. ""As well as vehicle crews, up to 100 military personnel are standing by for duties likely to include sandbag filling and loading,"" the MoD said on its Twitter feed. The Somerset Levels have been badly hit by flooding in recent weeks. Villages such as Muchelney have been cut off for almost a month and about 11,500 hectares (28,420 acres) of the Levels are flooded. More heavy rain is expected over the next few days. Maj Al Robinson, from the Royal Engineers, who has been assessing how the military can help, said they were ""concentrating on understanding the situation"" and ""very much supporting the planning which the local council are doing"". 'Welcome news' Councillor David Hall, deputy leader of Somerset County Council, said: ""We've been promised that we'll have access to whatever we need in terms of personnel and military vehicles at very short notice. ""What it potentially means is that we will have military personnel to supplement what we are doing already to help people. ""The second biggie - we are expecting more rain, high winds, and potentially some tidal surge problems this weekend so it's very reassuring we are going to have extra support on hand if needed."" David Heath, the Liberal Democrat MP for Somerton and Frome, said it was ""very welcome news that the military are going to lend a hand"". ""We are expecting another high spring tide at the weekend along with a lot more rain. ""Where there is specialist equipment I would certainly like to see the engineers see what they can do to improve access."" 'Huge pumping operation' MP Maria Eagle, Labour's shadow environment secretary, has criticised the government's response to the flooding. She said environment secretary Owen Paterson had ""dithered"" and ""failed to take flooding seriously"". ""Just days after the environment secretary announced that he wanted to see a concrete plan presented to him in six weeks, David Cameron has had enough of Owen Paterson's dithering and called in the army.""

"Dawn Butler told BBC 5 Radio Live she was in a members-only lift when an unnamed Commons member told her: ""This lift really isn't for cleaners.""

"Gregory McMichael, aged 64, and Travis McMichael, aged 34, were detained on Thursday by the state bureau of investigation. Both were charged with murder and aggravated assault, investigators said in a statement. Mr Arbery, 25, was jogging in February when he was confronted by the pair. For more than two months, police did not charge the McMichaels, who are white, until the shooting gained widespread attention in the national media and provoked outrage. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced late on Thursday that both men had been taken into custody. The bureau said the father and son followed Mr Arbery and confronted him with two firearms, and the younger McMichael shot and killed him. How did Arbery die? Mr Arbery was out running in the coastal city of Brunswick early in the afternoon of 23 February. Gregory McMichael told police he saw Mr Arbery and believed he resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins. Mr McMichael and his son armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and pursued Mr Arbery in a pick-up truck. Gregory McMichael told police he and his son said ""stop, stop, we want to talk to you"" and claims Mr Arbery then attacked his son. Video footage of the incident appears to show Travis McMichael firing a shotgun at point blank range at Mr Arbery and the victim falling to the street, in the Satilla Shores neighbourhood. Mr Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, said police told her after the shooting that her son had been involved in a burglary before the incident, but the family say they do not believe the keen jogger had committed a crime. He was unarmed and carrying nothing. A number of calls were made to police around the time of the confrontation, according to a CBS News report. In one 911 call, a neighbour said a black man was seen at a home under construction in the area. When asked what the man was doing now, the caller said ""running down the street"". Mobile phone video of the shooting incident has now emerged. The footage, apparently filmed by another man in the neighbourhood, appears to show the McMichaels waiting for Mr Arbery as he jogs down the road in broad daylight. The 36-second clip was shot from a vehicle following the pick-up truck said to be involved in the incident. Mr Arbery is seen jogging and then approaching the stationary pick-up from behind. He then tries to bypass the truck and is seen struggling with a man carrying a shotgun - believed to be Travis McMichael. There is muffled shouting and shotgun shots. A second man is standing in the bed of the pick-up - understood to be Gregory McMichael. The second man is then shown with a pistol standing alongside the other armed man with Mr Arbery no longer in view. 'Lynched before our very eyes' The victim's father told PBS Newshour on Thursday that his son exercised in the area daily and stayed across the street at his mother's house. ""I don't know why they racially profile him and done him like that,"" said Marcus Arbery, ""because all he did is work out and ran and just took care of his body, because he had dreams now."" Asked about the suggestion that his son could have been implicated in a burglary, Mr Arbery said that was ""just a lie and a cover-up"". ""The video speaking everything for itself,"" he said. ""Check that lynch mob out."" The family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said the footage showed a ""horrific execution"". The attorney also claimed Gregory McMichael was not initially charged because he had worked as a police officer and a detective for the local district attorney for more than 30 years. The shooting has led to a wave of outrage from national figures, including presidential candidate Joe Biden and basketball star LeBron James. Mr Biden said Mr Arbery had been ""shot down in cold blood"" and ""essentially lynched before our very eyes"". ""This family and the country deserves justice and they deserve it now. They deserve a transparent investigation of this brutal murder. But our nation deserves it as well. We need to reckon with this, this goes on. These vicious acts call to mind the darkest chapters of our history,"" Mr Biden said.","A father and son have been arrested and charged in the US state of Georgia for the fatal shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man."
"Stephen Lawrence was 18 when he died, and 18 years later his name is back on people's lips as Gary Dobson and David Norris are convicted at the Old Bailey. His death in Eltham, south-east London, was a tragedy for his family but also became an event which led the nation to reflect on attitudes to race and justice. A public inquiry into the unsolved murder - one of the most high-profile in Britain - accused the Metropolitan Police of ""institutional racism"" and incompetence. The Macpherson Report's recommendations in 1999 also triggered a major reform of the justice system in England and Wales. Film extra Stephen was born on 13 September 1974 at Greenwich District Hospital in south-east London to Neville and Doreen Lawrence, who had emigrated from Jamaica in the 1960s. He had two younger siblings - Stuart and Georgina - and the family grew up in Plumstead and attended Trinity Methodist Church in Woolwich, where Stephen was christened. Stephen's character at home and school was shaped by an ethos of tolerance, religious faith and education. His father Neville, now 69, was a carpenter, upholsterer, tailor and plasterer, while Doreen took a university course and became a special needs teacher. As a young child, Stephen was good at most subjects at school, but loved to draw and paint and favoured art and maths. By the age of seven he had resolved to become an architect - a career path he never deviated from. At 16, his interest in design led him to set up a small business with a friend, designing and selling T-shirts, caps and jackets of well-known bands, rappers and politicians such as Malcolm X. He loved music, particularly soul and R&B. As his confidence in himself and others grew, friends say he developed a good and trusting nature. At one time he worked as a film extra alongside actor Denzel Washington in the film For Queen and Country. Stephen also excelled out of the classroom. He was an active member of the Cambridge Harriers Athletic Club and once ran for Greenwich. As a Cub, then Scout, he won badges for everything from cooking to sailing. Like many teenage boys, he liked going out and girls. At the time of his death, aged 18, he was studying A-levels in English, craft, design and technology, and physics at Blackheath Bluecoat Church of England School. 'Rebellious streak' It was there that he met Duwayne Brooks, his close friend who witnessed the attack that led to Stephen's death. Mr Brooks told the trial he met Stephen on the first day of school aged 11, and that by the time of his death, they were best friends. He said he had begun a course at Lewisham College, while Stephen decided to stay on into the sixth form. Stephen planned to study architecture at university and after his GCSEs, his family helped him find work experience with architect Arthur Timothy's practice. The Royal Institute of British Architects later established an annual architectural award in his memory. The Stephen Lawrence Prize is intended to encourage fresh, emerging talent working with smaller budgets. Stephen's mother Doreen told Sir William Macpherson's judicial inquiry into the killing: ""I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future. ""He was well-loved and, had he been given the chance to survive, maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white because he didn't distinguish between black or white. He saw people as people."" In 1998, Doreen set up the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, which gives bursaries to young people who want to become architects. Stephen had never been involved in crime, but the Reverend David Cruise - who led the church where the Lawrences worshipped - said it would be wrong to paint him as a saint. Speaking after his death, he said: ""Stephen was no goody-goody. He had his rebellious streak. Mrs Lawrence asked me to talk sense into him when he hadn't been behaving well. ""When I tried he just smiled his cheeky, knowing grin."" Stephen was a normal young man gifted with maturity and charm, he added. ""The irony is that the Lawrences behaved exactly how every black family is supposed to behave. They were law-abiding, close, stable, relaxed and upwardly mobile."" Marion Randall, the Lawrences' neighbour in Plumstead for 13 years, said after his death: ""I feel like I have lost one of my own. But though my kids and Stephen's friends are now grown-up, just who Stephen would have been we will never know."" Stephen's father was 18 years old when he left his birthplace of Kingston, Jamaica, in 1960. And it was the Caribbean that the family decided should be the final resting place for the teenager killed on a London street. Stephen's remains were buried 35 miles (56km) west of the capital in Jamaica's Clarendon parish. He lies beside his great grandmother.","Two men have been found guilty of the murder of Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager stabbed to death by a gang of white youths at a London bus stop in 1993. The high-profile case has had a major impact on race relations in Britain. So who was he?"
"The lower house approved a law to reduce the number of MPs from 630 to 400 and senators from 315 to 200. The reform was a manifesto promise of the populist Five Star Movement, the main party in Italy's governing coalition. They say it will streamline parliament and save hundreds of millions of euros in salaries and expenses. However, critics say the move will weaken democracy and increase the influence of lobbyists. The new law is potentially subject to a confirmatory referendum as it makes changes to the Italian constitution. ""It's done! Promise kept"" a blog post from Five Star said after the vote in the lower house on Tuesday. In a post on Twitter, Five Star said the bill - which was supported by almost all parties - would save the country €1bn (£897m) over 10 years. ""It's the day we've been awaiting forever,"" Cabinet Secretary Riccardo Fraccaro said, according to Ansa. ""After almost 30 years of broken promises, the cut in MPs and senators is a reality. A new political season is starting, now the citizens are at the centre."" The news agency AGI (in Italian) calculated that as an MP costs €230,000 per year and a senator €249,600, the cuts in the lower house would save €52.9m annually and those in the senate €28.7m. The new law should come into effect after the next elections which are due in 2023. A governing coalition between Five Star and the far-right League party broke down in August. Last month Five Star entered into a new coalition with the centre-left PD and made the new law a condition of its alliance. The government's other main objective is to pass a budget to block a rise in VAT (sales tax), which is set to kick in on 1 January if the government fails to reach its debt-reduction target.",Italy's parliament has voted to cut the number of representatives in both houses by more than a third.
"The men received the Arctic Star, an honour awarded for the first time this year in recognition of service on the dangerous maritime missions. The sailors worked to keep supplies flowing to the Soviet Union. The ceremony was held near Loch Ewe, where many of the convoys of ships carrying food and weapons sailed from. Jock Dempster, from Dunbar, had been among the veterans expected to attend the event. However, the 85-year-old died on Sunday. He received the Arctic Star during a ceremony at Downing Street in March. Mr Dempster was 16 in 1944 when he first sailed in the convoys, battling extreme weather and German bombardment to help keep a supply line with Russia open. Veterans, including Mr Dempster, and politicians campaigned for many years for a specific medal to be created in recognition of service on the convoys. Between 1941 and 1945, merchant ships left Loch Ewe - as well as the Clyde and ports in Iceland - to deliver supplies, weapons and ammunition. About 3,000 men died during the convoys. Great Britain, the US and Canada were involved in shipping the supplies. PQ17 was the most disastrous and infamous of the convoys. In July 1942, more than 20 vessels were sunk following orders to scatter because of fears of an attack by warships, which included the Tirpitz. After attending the medal ceremony, Veterans Minister Keith Brown paid tribute to the efforts of the Arctic convoy sailors. He said: ""This group made an immeasurable contribution to the Allied forces' efforts, facing the enemy in some of the toughest conditions anywhere on the planet. ""Their bravery meant vital supply routes were never cut off."" Mr Brown added: ""Along with many others, I consistently made a case to the UK government to ensure that this group were not forgotten or lost in history."" Fund-raising is ongoing to cover the costs of building a planned Arctic Convoy museum near Loch Ewe.",More than 30 veterans of World War II's Russian Arctic Convoys have been presented with medals at a ceremony in Wester Ross.
"Charlotte Rumsey came across the rare find while sorting through a box of unwanted things at her mother's house in Blackpool. The hardback copy of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is one of only 500 printed. Book expert Jim Spencer said it could reach £50,000 in an online sale held in Staffordshire on 11 December. Ms Rumsey had initially discarded the book in a 50p box destined for a car boot sale in July. After watching the TV programme Antiques Roadshow, Ms Rumsey had second thoughts and asked her mum to check the copy with Hansons Auctioneers. On finding out the book was a genuine first edition, a ""delighted"" Ms Rumsey said she ""couldn't stop hopping about"". Another first edition of the book sold in October for a hammer price of £60,000. 'We are still pinching ourselves' Ms Rumsey said: ""A friend of the family gave it to us for me and my brothers to read as they thought we might enjoy it. ""We are still pinching ourselves - things like this don't happen to normal families like us,"" she said. Bride-to-be Ms Rumsey said she plans to split the money from the winning bid on her wedding and her mother's new home. It is the fifth hardback issue of the book that Mr Spencer of Hanson Auctioneers had discovered in under two years, he said. He said he was ""delighted"" for the family. Mr Spencer said: ""Charlotte said she was hopping about when I called her confirming it was a first issue."" ""Of the 500 copies printed, 300 went to schools and libraries - so this is a good example of one of the scarcer 200 that went to shops,"" he added.

"They had addressed a public meeting a couple of days ago, denouncing the federal government for rendering arms help to the Lankan government which, they said, were decimating the Tamils there. The pair had warned Tamil Nadu itself would secede from the Indian union if the atrocities against Lankan Tamils went on unchecked. While Vaiko was arrested at the state capital of Chennai, his deputy Kannappan was picked up at his native village in the western part of the state. Vaiko was later remanded in custody until 06 November. ""Instigating"" Tiger supporters The state has been witnessing some intense activities in recent weeks by Tamil nationalist groupings. Even the ruling DMK has warned that if the Centre does not ensure a cease fire in Lanka, its MPs would be resigning from the parliament. DMK is a key constituent of India's ruling coalition. Another protest demonstration was held on Thursday in Chennai by the Viduthalai Chiruthaikal Katchi (VKC), led by Thol Thirumavalavan, a strong supporter of the Tamil Tiger rebels. Last week there was a rally by film directors and artistes in Rameswaram when some strident speeches were made. Only Wednesday, Jayalalithaa, the most important opposition leader, had denounced the state government for allegedly instigating Tiger supporters and described them as anti-nationals. The state Congress too, whose support in the legislature is critical to the DMK government, has expressed its unhappiness over the frenetic activity of the Tamil nationalist elements.","Two prominent pro-LTTE leaders of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Vaiko, general secretary of the MDMK and M Kannappan, presidium chairman, were arrested by the state police on charges of sedition."
"Ray Harmer told the House of Keys a ""draft business case"" to upgrade the line between St John's and Kirk Michael had been ""submitted to treasury"". He said work on the old track between Douglas and Peel was already under way. The additional works would be ""the start of linking Douglas and Peel with Ramsey,"" he added. Alex Allinson MHK said using the former steam railway track was ""an intrinsic part"" of the government's Active Travel Strategy, which aims to encourage travellers to use transport other than motor vehicles to get to work. The steam railway routes between Douglas and Peel, and St John's and Ramsey were closed in 1968. During the same debate, Mr Harmer dismissed a suggestion by Bill Shimmins MHK to run the Manx Electric Railway (MER) on a single track between Douglas and Ramsey to accommodate walkers and cyclists. Mr Shimmins had claimed it would create a ""safer walking and cycle route"" on the eastern side of the island, but the infrastructure minister said the cost of converting the track would be ""absolutely immense"" and create ""very deep safety concerns"".","A former railway line in the west of the Isle of Man could be turned into a safe walking and cycling route, the infrastructure minister has said."

"The stolen Volvo S60 hit Tom Carey, 27, as well as two other cars and a wall in Bevois Hill, Southampton, before bursting into flames on 27 March. Mr Carey, a surveyor, spent 12 days in hospital with broken bones and a torn liver, Southampton Crown Court heard. Gentjan Lalaj, 21, of London, was convicted in November of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. At his trial, Albanian national Lalaj claimed he was subject to a blood feud, a tradition where descendants were killed in revenge for murders committed by their ancestors. He told the jury he thought the unmarked police car behind him contained Albanians involved in the feud. Police abandoned the pursuit as the Volvo overtook cars, reaching a speed of 60mph in a 30mph zone, the court heard. Lalaj was previously found not guilty of two counts of possessing Class A drugs with intent to supply. It was alleged heroin and cocaine had been in the petrol cap of the car and were ejected when Lalaj pressed the release cap button. In a victim impact statement, Mr Carey, from Rochester, Kent, said he had suffered night terrors and ongoing pain, after injuries to his knee, shoulder, collarbone, liver and nose. Mr Carey, who was marking a pavement when he was hit, had been left unable to work, the court heard. 'Life-long injuries' Passing sentence, Judge Nicholas Rowland said the jury had rightly rejected Lalaj's defence of duress of circumstances. ""You were trying to outrun the police because you were driving a stolen vehicle,"" he said. ""The police were trying to stop you but they had to give up because you were driving so dangerously."" He imposed a six-and-a-half-year driving ban on Lalaj, of Hazelwood Lane, Palmers Green, who previously pleaded guilty to driving with no licence or insurance. After the hearing, Mr Carey said Lalaj had left him with ""life-long injuries"" and the sentence was ""a lot less than I've got"".","A driver who hit a workman, catapulting him over a wall, while fleeing police has been jailed for three years."
"By Hazel ShearingBBC News ""Have a good look at the cameras now,"" the audience is told. It's best not to stare at them while you're singing. But two people in the audience already know the drill. They've been coming for years. Trevor and Christine Ransome, a couple in their 70s from Cambridgeshire, joined hundreds of others at a Songs of Praise recording in Leicester's De Montfort Hall this week to count down the nation's top 10 favourite hymns. It was their 37th recording, their latest excursion for a hobby that has taken them from Glasgow to Penzance in the past year alone. Two weeks earlier they had travelled to the Isle of Wight. ""I would do every one if I could,"" jokes Trevor, sitting in the stalls as the performers sound check in the background. Christine, eyebrows raised, agrees: ""He'd fly to Timbuktu if they were doing it there."" On their way through a crowded backstage area, a producer stops Christine for a hug. ""We know them all by first names,"" says Trevor. ""It's almost like being part of a family."" Trevor and Christine met as teenagers at a church in Suffolk, where they bonded over their love of singing and music. Hobbies have played a big part of their relationship ever since: two days before coming to Leicester, they celebrated their 58th wedding anniversary in Prague, where Trevor, 78, had run a 10km race. ""Although I wasn't the fastest runner, I wasn't last either,"" he beams. ""But I was the oldest."" He says he is one away from his goal of completing 50 races. Their trips to recordings began over 10 years ago, when they were a few years into retirement. Before then, Trevor had worked for a packaging company while Christine had been a shorthand typist. They had always sung in choirs, and played keyboard in church groups. ""We sang here a few years ago,"" says Christine, looking up at the hall's arched ceiling. Their first recording was in 2008 at a church in Ealing, London, where they were singing as part of a choir. Trevor describes it as an ""awesome experience"" that left them with a ""real feel-good factor"". Not long afterwards, a woman who joined their local church told them that she had been inspired to come after watching Songs of Praise. ""She wanted to know where such happiness came from - the happiness she saw on the faces of the people singing,"" says Trevor. 'Touching heaven' Their next recording was in Peckham in 2010, and since 2014, once Trevor stepped down from his role as a church elder, they have gone to every one they can make. ""To me, with all the wonderful things that the Songs of Praise technical team do - lighting up the place - and with all these different people and different [church] traditions, it's a little bit like touching heaven,"" says Trevor. Recordings with gospel choirs are his favourite, he adds: ""I love the freedom, I love the joy with which everyone approaches it. The choir is singing it, the congregation are up on their feet and I can't help myself, you know? I'm joining in."" They have to balance their trips, however, with the demands of a large family: two sons, four grandchildren and four great grandchildren. ""We go regularly to church, we're sad that none of our children do,"" says Trevor, before adding that their family are very supportive of their hobby. ""They all watch it to see if they can pick us out in the audience,"" says Christine. They also watch when they are not at recordings - although they say nothing compares to being in the congregation. Asked for tips for people who shy away from singing at church events, Trevor suggests taping yourself. ""Try hearing the sound of your voice the day before you go to a wedding or a funeral, where you know you might be singing, to get used to it,"" he says. ""Do not be frightened of your own voice."" Song of Praise has been running a national vote to find the audience's favourite hymn. For Christine, it is Carl Boberg's How Great Thou Art. ""It makes me want to worship, because sometimes I don't feel like worshipping,"" she says, lamenting that people can say ""slightly hurtful"" things about their faith. ""Everyone has their own [beliefs],"" says Trevor. ""We believe that God allows us to have free choice."" For him, the opening lyrics to Keith Green's There is a Redeemer are the most resounding. ""It isn't I hope I'll stand in glory, it starts: when I stand in glory,"" he smiles. ""That's a certainty in an absolutely uncertain world. And that is a great comfort."" The couple have no plans to stop attending the show. ""We're going to celebrate our 60th wedding anniversary in September 2021. Wouldn't it be lovely if we managed to get to 60 Songs of Praise recordings at virtually the same time?"" ""We've got to go some,"" Christine laughs. The recording of Songs of Praise in De Montfort Hall, Leicester, will be aired on BBC One on 29th September.","A buzz of excitement echoes around the audience as a gospel choir files on stage, lining up in front of an organ tinted pink by the lights above."
"Gloucestershire Warwickshire Steam Railway (GWSR) currently runs between Cheltenham and Laverton but wants to extend to Broadway in Worcestershire. A public share scheme raised more than £500,000 in 2014 but to complete the extension it now needs to raise £1.25m. Mr Waterman, GWSR president, said: ""There's nothing wrong with the railway now but the jewel was always Broadway."" Along with funding the last mile of track, it is hoped the public share issue will also pay for a station at Broadway which is due to open in 2018. Ian Crowder, from GWSR, said it would put Broadway ""back on the railway map for the first time in half a century"". ""We've been laying track at the rate of about a third of a mile a year since 1984 and by the time we reach Broadway we'll be the fourth longest heritage railway in Britain,"" he said. Mr Waterman said he was optimistic the target could be reached, following the success of a similar £1m emergency fundraising appeal in 2010. ""I think the response that we got for the landslides six years ago was colossal and I think that's what spurred us all to believe we could get this far,"" he said.

"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is using surgical beds for medical patients and has had to create more in-patient beds to cope with demand. The Queen Elizabeth University Hospital had to cancel 14 operations on Thursday. It blamed winter pressures from flu, respiratory infections and norovirus. Jane Grant, chief executive of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: ""We planned for these winter pressures by creating extra capacity - such as extra in-patient beds at Gartnavel Hospital and restricting staff holidays. 'Additional pressures' ""Our winter plan is designed to create extra resilience and enable us to respond to these additional pressures and open additional in-patient beds where appropriate. ""These winter beds are currently being used. ""We accept that a number of our patients have waited longer than we would have liked. ""However, this is due to the high level of demand and we apologise to those patients who experienced lengthy waits. ""When our patients are kept waiting for admission to hospital they are still receiving care from our doctors and nurses."" The number of flu cases in Scotland during the last week of December was double that during the same period last year. The total recorded suffering from the virus went from 22 per 100,000 in the last week of December 2016 to 46 per 100,000 in 2017. Health Protection Scotland (HPS) said half of NHS Boards are reporting significant ward pressure as a result. Health Secretary Shona Robison has thanked staff for their ""ongoing dedication and hard work throughout this exceptionally busy winter period"". She said: ""Health staff across Scotland are dedicated to helping patients and are doing a fantastic job in difficult circumstances. ""These figures show once again the challenges they are tackling. ""So far, the vaccine is proving to be effective against the most commonly encountered flu strains this season although it is still too early to have a complete picture. ""But there's no doubt that the increase in cases, particularly affecting people with complex and multiple conditions, is putting increased pressure on our systems."" The flu increase caused a big rise in demand for NHS services. According to HPS, in the final week of 2017: The health minister said: ""Our £22.4m winter funding, the highest amount in any one year, will continue to be invested in health boards throughout winter to help them cope with pressures. ""Scottish government ministers, clinicians and senior officials are continuing to monitor the situation closely and keep in contact with boards to fully understand and assist with the pressures they are under. ""It is important for patients to be aware that while health boards continue to take all appropriate steps to respond to increased demand in line with their winter plans - which may include some deferral of non-urgent elective surgery - there is no blanket cancellation of non-urgent elective procedures for the month of January as is the case in England.""

"It is now considering a system with digital versions of established currencies, including the dollar and the Euro, according to Bloomberg and tech site The Information. The Libra Association, which Facebook founded to create the currency, will continue its work, the reports said. The plan will include Libra, the company said in response. The social network's digital wallet is now expected to launch this autumn, several months later than initially planned, according to the reports. Of earlier reports that it might drop Libra itself, the firm said: ""Facebook remains fully committed to the project."" Facebook announced in June last year that it would launch the Libra digital currency, with a goal of making payments easier and cheaper. Its partners in the Libra Association include Lyft, Spotify, Shopify, but several other high-profile members such as Visa left after the idea was criticised by authorities.

Some parents have criticised the decision and questioned why it has only been put in place now, two weeks into the term. 'Protect our children' One, from Glen Hills Primary School in Glen Parva, said: ""I realise that we need to do everything we can to prevent the spread of the virus but we've been dropping off and picking up for weeks now and nothing has been said until today.

She said: ""It's a good idea, especially when hospital admissions and cases are going up. We need to do everything we can to protect our children."" Parents outside Ashby Hill Top Primary school had differing opinions. Karen Blythe said: ""They didn't ask us to do it before, I just don't see the point. ""If we were going into the school I would do it but when I am walking on a public path and not even entering the school gate, what's the point?"" But Claire McLaren said: ""Totally agree 100%. I think everyone should be wearing masks if they are able. ""It's a good step in the right direction. I think it will make everyone safer."" Rebecca Shearer said: ""I don't have a problem with it at all, any means of protection is worthwhile. ""We have to protect our children, we have to get the Covid rate down. ""It's not about following government guidelines, I'd do it anyway."" Oadby and Wigston reported the second highest rate of coronavirus infections in England after the number of cases tripled in a week, from 25 to 76. The latest government data shows the district's rate went from 43.8 by 5 September up to 133.3 by 12 September. Leicester City Council confirmed the decision was made in conjunction with Leicestershire County Council. 'Outside the box' A spokeswoman for the city council said: ""We are recommending that parents wear face coverings when they pick up or drop off their children at school. ""This is as an added preventative measure to help stop the spread of Covid-19 at a time when cases are rising."" She added it should help lower the risk where ""social distancing is difficult"" at school gates and was a ""sensible precaution"" for parents as infection rates in the area rise again. A Leicestershire County Council spokesperson said the decision had been taken to ""further support children's return to education"". ""It is vital that children are in school, that schools are supported to ensure they remain a safe environment for children and we all play a part in preventing the spread of infection,"" they added. The county's director of public health, Mike Sandys, previously said he does not see schools as a ""hotbed"" of infection, but did have concerns about the ""outside the box"" side of schools, including parents gathering outside of gates or going on play dates after pick up time. The government does not recommend the universal use of face coverings in schools, however it added in areas where local lockdowns or restrictions were in place, they should be worn by pupils, staff and visitors outside the classroom - such as in corridors and communal areas - where social distancing was difficult to maintain.

"Damian McBride told BBC Two's Newsnight that many in the Labour Party regarded him as a ""traitor"" for serialising his memoirs during its annual conference. But he added Labour must ""learn lessons from his mistakes"". He said the party needed to move on from ""destructive"" feuds of the past. Mr McBride has admitted leaking details about the personal lives of Labour ministers seen as a threat to Gordon Brown's ambitions to replace Tony Blair as prime minister after the 2005 election. The revelations, published in the Daily Mail, have caused anger among senior Labour figures past and present and provided a reminder of the bitter divisions during the Blair-Brown years. Interviewed live on Newsnight, Mr McBride said: ""I do feel ashamed, I do feel sorry to those individuals whose careers I affected and even more so to the sort of innocent bystanders who were caught in the way."" In his book he suggests Mr Brown had been aware of his methods and gave his unspoken approval. 'Exorcise demons' But he told Newsnight Mr Brown did not know about the ""intricacies"" of his actions or ""understand"" how he operated, and current leader Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls ""knew even less than Gordon"". ""I don't think he (Brown) knew what I was doing a lot of the time,"" Mr McBride said. ""I operated quite a lot in the shadows."" In his first broadcast comments since the serialisation began, Mr McBride also used a recorded section with the programme to defend its timing, suggesting such books ""always come out at conference season"" and it would have done more damage if it had been published closer to the next election. He added: ""I know many people in the Labour movement think I'm a traitor for publishing a book lifting the lid on some of [the Blair-Brown] feuding, especially at party conference. ""But I believe if Labour's going to avoid repeating its mistakes, it's got to learn from its past, exorcise its demons, and make sure that when it says those days are over, it means it."" Interviewed later on Newsnight in front of Labour activists, Mr McBride said he agreed with Mr Balls, who has said his actions were ""despicable"". Describing himself as ""still a Labour supporter"", Mr McBride said ""there's no good time to publish a book like this"". But he added that he had been offered a ""much more lucrative contract"" than the £100,000-plus he received from the Daily Mail to publish the memoirs just ahead of the 2015 general election. He said he had left his job with nothing and built up debts which the money from the book would help to pay off. The book's revelations include claims that Mr McBride: 'Unconscionable' Mr McBride has also attempted to implicate Mr Miliband in the spin culture that prevailed in parts of the Labour government, suggesting he might ""have problems"" if email exchanges between Mr Miliband and spin doctor Derek Draper came to light. Mr Miliband has insisted that although he knew negative briefings were going on, he did not approve of them and had urged Mr Brown to get rid of his aide. Speaking on Monday, Mr Balls - a close ally of Mr Brown when he was chancellor and prime minister - said ""many people"", including himself, had been unaware of what Mr McBride was up to. ""What Damian McBride did was wrong and, to be honest, unconscionable,"" he told BBC News. ""I have never seen people behave in this way - personal, nasty, smeary, made-up stories. I think it is hideous and people are shocked by it."" Meanwhile, Conservative MP Alun Cairns has called for the police to investigate whether Mr McBride may have broken the Official Secrets Act and the Computer Misuse Act after Mr McBride admitted in his book that he had accessed Gordon Brown's email account without authorisation. Mr McBride told Newsnight he ""would not leak classified comments and I would take pains to avoid doing that... I'd be happy to talk to police if they wanted an explanation of this"". Another Tory MP, Henry Smith, demanded that Mr McBride be stripped of his civil service pension if he was found to have breached the civil service code and the special advisers' code of conduct.","Gordon Brown's former spin doctor has said he is ""sorry and ashamed"" about those affected by his actions, as he defended writing about his attacks on the ex-PM's opponents."
"And it warns that if coastal defence work is withdrawn the figure would rise to 580 houses and businesses lost. The Shoreline Management Plan (SMP) was produced by the Environment Agency and councils to inform planning policies. The south Devon report suggests that bolstering defences in coastal villages Branscombe, Torcross and Beesands may be unsustainable as sea levels rise. Erosion 'accelerating' The SMP, which takes climate change and the geology of the area into account, says that in the north Devon area , 19 residential and commercial properties risk being lost over the next 100 years. If defence works were withdrawn the figure could rise to 325 properties. Tony Burch, a retired strategic planner and policy advisor in Devon for the Environment Agency, said: ""We have a very active coastline in Devon, East Anglia and in other parts of the country. ""Over the generations people have built on the coastline and with sea level rises, greater storms and climate change, erosion is accelerating in some locations."" Twelve houses in Cliff Road, Sidmouth in south Devon are losing their gardens at a rate of 6.5ft (2m) a year. A working group has been set up to consider ways to slow down the erosion. The Environment Agency, which publishes SMPs on its website , said: ""Approximately 10% of the population in England and Wales are at risk from coastal flooding; billions of pounds of infrastructure are at risk from this and coastal erosion. ""Coastal flood risk management needs to take account of the local features of each section of the coast in order to be managed effectively: a 'one size fits all' approach won't be cost effective. ""As a result of this, coastal flooding is managed through the Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) on each stretch of the coast. ""We work alongside local authorities in developing each SMP to ensure that coastal flooding is managed sustainably.""","About 160 properties could be lost to the sea in south Devon over the next 23 years, according to a report."
"Suffolk County Council approved plans for a 420-place primary school to meet demand from new housing close to RAF Lakenheath. However, parish councillors are challenging the move, claiming noise levels would exceed World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines. A county council spokesman described the challenge as ""misconceived"". RAF Lakenheath is home to the US Air Force's 48th Fighter Wing. Planning permission for the school off Station Road was granted by the county council's development and regulation committee in October after the green light was given for 660 new homes, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. But councillor Hermione Brown, chairman of Lakenheath Parish Council's planning sub-committee, said the school ""should be appropriately situated, well away from the jet flight path with all its noise and safety implications"". ""Above all we want to protect the children of our community, which is why we have so strongly resisted the inappropriate siting of a proposed school on land directly under a military jet flight path,"" she said. A spokesman from Suffolk County Council said: ""The new school has been designed to be suitable for use in Lakenheath, taking into account site specific concerns including noise. ""The proposed location is shown by official figures to be in the quietest part of the village.""",A dispute over plans to build a school under the flight path of USAF jets in Suffolk is to go the High Court.
"At the time of the payments, Soco was operating in Virunga National Park in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The company strongly rejects any suggestion that the payments were connected with the alleged abuse. Last year, Soco ended its activities in Virunga, which is home to some of the last remaining mountain gorillas. The BBC's DR Congo reporter Maud Jullien says the months the company spent exploring for oil in the park, a Unesco World Heritage site, angered campaigners and sparked international outrage. Africa news updates The 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) park is one of the most ecologically diverse places on Earth, but it has suffered from the years of lawlessness and conflict between armed groups based in eastern DR Congo attracted by the area's rich mineral resources. Soco used Congolese government soldiers to secure its staff and infrastructure in the volatile region. 'Threatened and tortured' Cheques and receipts obtained by the campaign group Global Witness, and seen by the BBC, show the company paid an army major called Burimba Feruzi. The payments total $42,250 (£27,290) over the course of two weeks in spring 2014. That is the equivalent to several years' salary for a Congolese army major. Several people have said they were threatened by Maj Feruzi. One person said that men following the major's orders had tortured him, stating it was because he had opposed oil exploration. Virunga: DR Congo seeks Virunga park boundary change The London-listed company said it has never denied funding the work of the Congolese army ""or that Maj Feruzi was the DRC army's military liaison officer assigned to Soco's security"". ""However, we strongly refute any suggestion that this funding was in any way improper or connected with alleged acts of intimidation or violence,"" it said in a statement. It said it was not allowed to enter the area where it carried out exploratory tests without a military escort. ""The soldiers assigned to Soco's security escort were always under the full command and control of the DRC army,"" it said.",The BBC has seen evidence that British firm Soco made payments to a Congolese army major accused of using violence to intimidate oil exploration opponents.
"Stoke-on-Trent MP Tristram Hunt is meeting arts minister Ed Vaizey to discuss the Wedgwood Museum's future. The museum in Stoke-on-Trent was put in administration in March after the transferral of a £130m pension debt from the pottery firm. Mr Hunt said he hoped the collection would not be dispersed. The museum, which remains open, won the £100,000 Art Fund prize in 2009. Labour MP Mr Hunt said he was not expecting the government to buy the collection but he hoped minister Ed Vaizey would support a plan where organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Arts Fund and local businesses could put a funding package together. Waterford Wedgwood Plc went into administration in January last year with a pension fund shortfall. The museum is linked to the firm by a shared pension fund, although only five members of the pension plan were employees of the museum trust when Wedgwood's firms became insolvent.",An MP is hoping money from businesses and lottery funds can be put together to make sure a ceramics museum does not have to sell its valuable artefacts.
"Politicians across all parties have said the referendum will mean fundamental changes to the current devolution settlement. Prime Minister David Cameron said Wales must have more say in its own affairs. Mr Jones earlier tweeted he was pleased Scotland voted to stay in the Union. In a speech on Friday morning he said Wales could not play second fiddle when the future of devolution was discussed. The BBC announced Scotland had voted to reject independence at about 06:15 BST on Friday. Nationally, the margin of victory was about 55% to 45%. The result brought an end to a two-year campaign and talks will now begin on devolving more powers to Scotland. Analysis: Tomos Livingstone, BBC Wales political correspondent Scotland has voted to stay in the United Kingdom - but that doesn't mean it 's back to business as usual. Politicians have been falling over themselves to say that nothing will be the same again, and with good reason. In Scotland itself there's a job of work to be done to heal the wounds of a divisive campaign. It won't be easy when the country as a whole voted no but the largest city, Glasgow, went for yes. But attention's already turning to what it means for the rest of the UK. The prime minister is due to make a statement later this morning, and he's expected to announce a version of ""English laws for English issues"". That would mean stopping Welsh MPs voting on some issues at Westminster; a beguilingly simple solution to English resentment, but there may be trouble ahead. Working out what's exactly is or isn't devolved to Wales isn't easy - a few disputes have already ended up in the Supreme Court. There have been more hints overnight that the Wales Bill will be altered before it becomes law, to remove restrictions on the income tax powers being proposed for the Welsh government. And then there's the money question - has the Scottish referendum finally cleared the way for a new system of funding the Welsh government, to replace the Barnett formula that so many Welsh politicians argue is unfair? There's a feeling that there's plenty up for grabs - but the exact shape of things to come is far from being decided.",First Minister Carwyn Jones has spoken about what the Scottish independence No vote could mean for future devolution in Wales.
"Michael Jones Jewellers was targeted for the fourth time in five years by a gang who smashed their way in with sledge-hammers on Tuesday morning. They grabbed Rolex watches but fled when a security device discharged smoke in the shop. One raider was then apprehended by a passer-by outside. Stuart O'Grady, a director of the jewellers on High Street, said: ""It was great to see. The British public are getting sick and tired on this going on."" The four raiders travelled down High Street on two mopeds as they targeted the jewellers at about 10:40 BST. Sledge-hammers Mr O'Grady said: ""These people are mindless - they rode down a pedestrianised area without any thought for the public. ""Two of them jumped off the mopeds with sledge-hammers and broke through the front door of the shop which is only unlocked for customers."" He added: ""They grabbed a number of watches but we have a security device... which was deployed. ""It means you cannot see your hand in front of your face, that prompted them to run from the shop. Helmet ripped off ""Members of the public ripped the helmet off one of the men and the other was apprehended by three or four local people."" Mr O'Grady told how members of the public attempted to stop the other two members of the gang, who were waiting outside on mopeds, by throwing A-board signs at them. ""We want to thank everyone from the local community for their help - without doing what they did all four men would have got away,"" he said. Mr O'Grady confirmed he and his staff were not threatened by the gang, but told of his frustration at the fourth raid in five years. ""We come to work to do a job but unfortunately the business we are in is classed as high risk,"" he said. ""We've had a loss of between £100,000 and £300,000 on the three previous occasions."" A 23-year-old London man has been charged with robbery in connection with the raid. He was remanded in custody at Banbury Magistrates' Court, and is due to appear before Oxford Crown Court on 17 September. A 21-year-old man from Essex was arrested on suspicion of robbery, and also of supplying drugs.

"Ms King added that if elected she would bring in an independent body to vet mayoral appointments.

He told BBC One's the Politics Show that he will fight the government's plans for cuts ""as I fought Thatcher"". 'Fight cuts' Former Bethnal Green MP Ms King accused her rival of ""cronyism"" over his former race advisor Lee Jasper who faced allegations about funding irregularities. Mr Jasper was cleared by police and City Hall. She said: ""I don't think we can deny that the perception was and remains that there were people at City Hall who were channelling funds to organisations they knew, their friends, and what we need to do is to restore trust. ""I think there has been a perception of cronyism without the shadow of a doubt. ""So that's why I am proposing a tough new appointments commission that would vet any of my appointments.""

"David McAllister, adviser to Chancellor Angela Merkel on the negotiations with the UK, said some of the UK's other EU reform proposals looked achievable. But the benefits limit risks violating EU non-discrimination rules, he said. The UK is to hold an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017. Restricting the rights of EU workers in the UK, such as tax credits, is an especially thorny issue. Poland in particular - with a large diaspora working in the UK - has voiced strong opposition. Freedom of movement for EU workers is a core value of the 28-nation bloc, and national restrictions can be challenged in the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Mr McAllister said the four-year qualification period for British in-work benefits, such as tax credits, was the trickiest part of the reform package put forward by Mr Cameron. And ""we cannot have quotas for EU workers"", he stressed. But he said there was understanding in Germany regarding UK concerns about abuse of the benefits system by some migrants. The son of a British civil servant who was based in Berlin, Mr McAllister is an MEP for Mrs Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU). He was speaking in London, as a guest of the Association of European Journalists. 'Fighting like mad' Reducing the incentives for EU migrants to move to the UK is seen as a way to cut immigration - something that Mr Cameron has pledged to do. In the year to March 2015, net migration to the UK reached an all-time high of 330,000, of whom 183,000 were EU citizens. Speaking in Bulgaria on Friday, Mr Cameron said changing the way the EU operated was ""hard, it takes time"". ""I expect us to have a full discussion in December but it is going to take longer to get the deal that Britain wants, that Britain needs,"" he said. ""I want to get the substance right before we hold our referendum and I am fighting like mad to get that done."" EU leaders will meet on 17-18 December, but their discussions are expected to focus on Europe's migrant crisis and terrorism threat. European Council President Donald Tusk said the summit ""should pave the way for a deal in February"" for the UK. He said he would be writing to all EU leaders on Monday with his assessment of Britain's proposals.

"By Catherine BurnsNewsbeat Reporter The number of 16-24 year olds in business has gone up from 26,000 in 2008 to over 30,000 in 2010. ""The cost is quite low, and can be done from back bedrooms"", says Adam Swash from Experian. A third of those start-ups stop trading after 3 years, according to research. Failure rate If someone over 25 years old starts their own business there's a 50:50 chance of it surviving for more than 3 years, the Experian figures say. But it's closer to a one in three chance for the under 25s. One explanation for this is people in their late teens or early 20s don't tend to have as much experience, business know-how or cash. Another reason is younger bosses are more likely to start-up in easier areas, Adam Swash from Experian says. ""Retail, hospitality, catering, construction,"" Adam lists as the most common areas of business. ""But these industries are pretty much at the whim of consumer spending at the moment and they're tough.""

"Plymouth's Derriford Hospital has seen an ""unprecedented rise"" in 12 months and has had to cancel operations. The Royal Devon (RD&E) and Royal Cornwall hospitals also saw a rise. South Western Ambulance Service, which runs the NHS 111 service, said it used ""appropriate pathways"" for patients. ""If the emergency department is the appropriate place for them, then that is where they will be taken,"" it said. It added that calls had increased ""in line with the NHS around the country"" and there had been further pressure from an influx of holidaymakers. ""In May 2014, 51.5% of all our patients were treated via other care pathways and not conveyed to emergency departments,"" it said. It worked with the NHS ""to ensure... patients get the right care, in the right place, at the right time"". The 111 helpline, which replaced NHS Direct, began in Devon in September 2013. Kevin Baber, chief operating officer at Derriford, said: ""About 270-280 people are attending every day, which is somewhere between 30 and 40 extra people each day. ""Many are attending with minor illnesses and injuries. ""I think it's difficult to say it's down to one thing, but we think there is possibly a link to the new NHS 111 number."" However, he said more work was needed to confirm the link. In June, the A&E department saw its highest ever daily attendance with 337 people. The RD&E said on average an additional 30 people a day had attended its A&E department between April and June 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Matthew Bryant, divisional director of medical services, said it was investigating whether there was a link between the 111 service and the rise. ""We are working closely with the 111 service and partners to learn any lessons and make appropriate improvements as soon as possible so that we can help avoid sustained increases in attendances as we experienced between April and June."" The Royal Cornwall Hospital saw A&E attendances rise from 6,438 in June 2013 to 7,002 in June 2014. Dr Mike Richards, from the Devon Local Medical Committee, said the NHS 111 service ""has been designed to be very safe for patients and to err on the side of caution"". ""A consequence of that could well be that a higher number of patients maybe being referred to A&E. ""It's not a criticism, but that is what is inherently within a very safe system.""","A rise in people using accident and emergency (A&E) departments could be linked to the rollout of the NHS non-emergency helpline, health bosses have said."
"By Tom EdgingtonBBC Reality Check Mr Davis's resignation was followed by that of the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - also over the government's Brexit strategy. But what is the common rulebook and why are some Brexiteers unhappy with it? What is the rulebook? Currently, EU member states have to follow the same standards and regulations. This is part of the single market rulebook on goods and services. Harmonised standards exist in all sorts of areas, such as chemicals, emissions, pharmaceuticals and food safety. The government wants to maintain parts of this rulebook to allow ""frictionless trade at the border"" after Brexit. Some of the detail was contained in the three page government document, released after the Chequers summit. The document says a treaty would be signed to allow for ""ongoing harmonisation on goods"" including agriculture and food. It also said the UK ""would strike different arrangements for services"". That suggests the UK is not looking to follow the model of the EEA (European Economic Area) countries - like Norway and Iceland. They are not EU members but they follow the single market rulebook on both goods and services. Services are very important to UK businesses: In 2016 the UK exported £106bn in services to the EU and the four European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. That compares to £158bn in goods exports. The government also believes the proposals will allow it to negotiate its own free trade deals with other countries, such as the US - but that is disputed by some Brexiteers. The sovereignty issue The UK will lose its place in the European Council, its representation at the European Commission and all of its 73 MEPs. The fear amongst some is that the UK will become a rule taker and no longer a rule maker. But the government says that if the EU decides to change the rulebook in the future, it will be the UK Parliament that decides whether to accept the changes. Others, like Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, believe the proposal strengthens parliamentary sovereignty: ""There's a world of difference between parliament being unlikely to vote down a new regulation and parliament being unable to vote down a regulation"", he said. ""Unable is where we are now."" But it's not clear what the consequences would be if the UK rejected any changes to the rulebook and standards consequently started to diverge, according to Jill Rutter from the Institute for Government think tank. ""Imagine the UK didn't like a change to regulations in the chemical industry"", she says. ""In order to maintain access we might have to set up our own regulatory body or set up new arrangements to check chemical goods at the border. ""That could mean big set-up costs."" The government document acknowledges that if Parliament voted to reject any changes to the rulebook, it would have to recognise ""that this would have consequences"". In her response to David Davis's resignation letter, Theresa May said not signing up to certain rules would lead to consequences for ""market access, security cooperation or the frictionless border."" Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon There's also the question of disputes and how to resolve them. The UK wants to set up a joint committee and independent arbitration in the event of a dispute over the rulebook. Cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom says the dispute mechanism would be ""equally presided over by UK courts and the European Court of Justice"". But the detail of how this would work in practice is still to be worked out. More detail is expected in the coming days when the government publishes its Brexit White Paper. Of course this is all predicated on the UK securing a Brexit deal with the EU. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News The museum has had 1.7m visitors since the start of April, 25% up on 2012, and was the UK's most popular cultural attraction for the sixth year running. Visits in May were up 42% up on last year and were the highest on record. ""What's really pleasing about those figures is that visitors are so young,"" said museum director Neil MacGregor. The report for 2012/13 said the 43% of visitors were aged between 16-34. Future shows will include an in-depth look at sex in Japanese art and an exhibition on Germany in 2014 to mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Most popular exhibitions ""Germany is a critical force in the shaping of Europe,"" Mr MacGregor told the BBC. ""We want to look at the long history of Germany and how German identity is shaped by elements from its deep past. ""Most of us in Britain tend to think of German history as essentially from 1914 to now. They are hugely important years but they are part of a much longer story."" The current blockbuster show Life and Death in Pompeii and Herculaneum achieved its original visitor target of 250,000 in three months of a six-month run. It is on course to be the third most popular charging exhibition in the British Museum's history - after 1972's Treasures of Tutankhamun and 2007's The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army. The exhibition Shakespeare: Staging the world was seen by more than 105,000 visitors, while Ice Age Art closed in early June with more than 90,000 visitors - a 133% increase on the original target of 40,000. Overall, the British Museum had more than 5.575 million visitors in 2011/2012, slightly down on the previous year's 5.8 million visitors. Mr MacGregor also said the British Museum would have to ""think very carefully"" how to accommodate an expected 5% cut in government funding to museums for 2015-2016. ""We don't know what we'll be able to continue to do, or what we'll have to reduce,"" he said. ""Here you have very successful museums in London and how we can keep offering to our visitors what they want is going to be the big challenge.""","The British Museum's Pompeii and Ice Age exhibitions have helped attract record numbers of visitors this year, the museum's annual report has said."
"By Margaryta MaliukovaBBC Monitoring Journalist Pawel Lukasik was reporting live for private channel TVN24 on a traffic jam caused by a bus, when Dmitry Salogub strode up to the bus and began to push it. The journalist, microphone still in hand, joined in. They got the bus moving and the journalist praised him for his effort. Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski has now commended the Belarusian migrant for helping in a ""difficult situation"". As the TVN reporter approached Mr Salogub at the back of the bus, he asked him: ""Are you rushing to get home?"" ""I don't speak Polish,"" the migrant replied in Polish before switching to Belarusian, which Poles can partially understand. When asked where he was from, he said: ""Belarus. Let's do it together."" Once the bus had begun to move he left before the Polish TV reporter could ask his name. The video was then shared online and the 28-year-old was identified by Belarusian journalists. He told Belarusian media he had no idea he was on air while pushing the bus. He had been stuck on a bus a kilometre (0.6 miles) further back and had decided to find out what was holding up the traffic. 'Instead of helping, people make videos' Mr Salogub said he had done nothing special and was surprised nobody else had tried to help earlier. ""In our world, instead of helping, people make videos of everything. I don't understand it,"" he told Belsat TV. Mr Salogub, who is studying and working in Warsaw, has said he has no plans to return to Belarus because of his opposition to the country's long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko. Mr Lukasik's report, meanwhile, was widely shared on Polish media and went viral on social media. There was praise for the journalist too for capturing the story and lending the Belarusian a hand. ""I respect real engaged journalism,"" tweeted journalist Pawel Biedrzycki. Others pointed out that everyone else sat in their cars and waited. ""We need such immigrants in Poland. People selflessly wanting to help,"" said journalist Pawel Jaskiewicz. Some saw the story as a symbol of the tenacity of Belarusian protesters who have taken to the streets to challenge the widely disputed presidential election victory claimed by Mr Lukashenko last August. Meanwhile, Mr Salogub insists he is no hero. ""It just happened this way. You should always be human and think of others. Then the world can change for the better,"" he said. As well as a 90-day travel pass from the Warsaw mayor, he's been offered a free course in Polish by a Warsaw language school, and plans to start shortly.

He added TfGM would be be reviewing Defra's proposals ""over the coming weeks"".
