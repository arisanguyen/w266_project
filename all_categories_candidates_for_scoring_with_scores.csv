This effectively makes the device useless, even if a different sim card is inserted into it, MSPs on the Scottish Parliament\'s justice committee have now approved the technology for use, after Justice Secretary Michael Matheson offered assurances that it was unlikely to interfere with mobile phones being used by people living close to prisons. Plan escapes Mobile phone use has become a major problem in prisons, with inmates using them to plan escapes or indiscipline, intimidate witnesses or to continue organising drug dealing or violence while they are behind bars. So far this year, 285 handsets and 116 sim cards have been recovered in Scottish prisons, and 76 prisoners have been charged with possession of a mobile phone. It was reported last month that prisoners at Saughton Prison in Edinburgh had posted nude photographs of themselves on social media. With mobile phones the size of matchboxes available, it is difficult to prevent devices and sim cards being smuggled in - and for prison officers to find those that are already in circulation. \'Serious risk\' The SPS has been Trialling ""']",0.181069959,0.049792531,0.098765432,0.098765432,25.02929837
