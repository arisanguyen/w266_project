"In a statement, the White House said more than 5.6 million fingerprint records were stolen from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). An initial investigation suggested only 1.1 million were lost. The OPM acts as the personnel office for the US government and keeps records on 21.5 million federal staff. Identity risk The OPM attack was uncovered in April this year and saw attackers make off with ID and security clearance information about US government staff. Social security numbers, names, addresses, health, financial and biometric data were all taken. Fingerprint records were also stolen and the continuing investigation into the breach has revealed that far more went missing than initially thought. The OPM played down the significance of the fingerprint theft saying that the ability to abuse the data was ""currently limited"". However, it acknowledged that the risk could rise as technology improved and fingerprints were increasingly used as a guarantee of identity. ""An inter-agency working group with expertise in this area ... will review the potential ways adversaries could misuse fingerprint data now and in the future,"" it said in a statement. The FBI, Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security are all part of the task force assessing how losing fingerprint data might affect victims. The OPM said it would soon start a massive project to inform all the people whose data had been stolen. Ken Munro from security firm Pen Test Partners said: ""The biggest concern about biometrics since day one has been revocation. ""It is easy to get a new password, pin or credit card after a breach but it's rather harder to get new fingers."" The announcement about the scale of the hack comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping makes a state visit to the US. Security experts have pointed the finger at China as the source of the attack but it has always denied any involvement. Mr Xi and President Obama are due to talk about cybersecurity when they meet later this week.","['Hackers who breached US government networks stole far more fingerprint records than first thought, officials have said.']",['US government employees have been affected by a massive data breach that exposed sensitive personal data.'],0.1818181818181818,0.06451612903225808,0.1818181818181818,0.1818181818181818,25.732927857600828
"Fourteen fire engines were sent to tackle the blaze, which affected a row of buildings on The Esplanade, in the early hours of Sunday. West Sussex fire service said some of the properties were derelict and the buildings were completely destroyed. Emergency teams were at the scene throughout Sunday and inspections by firefighters were due to continue throughout the night. Residents were evacuated to a leisure centre as crews faced ""difficult storm conditions"", the fire service said. Sussex Police said the fire broke out at Beach Restaurant and affected derelict buildings next to it. A police spokesman said a gas supply caught fire and had kept the flames going, but emphasised emergency teams were not dealing with a gas mains explosion. About 30 residents were evacuated from flats close to the fire when crews were called just before 04:00 GMT. Fifty firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze at its height. Lead officer Adrian Murphy said: ""This incident has taken place in the midst of a major storm and it was difficult to stand when we arrived on the seafront. ""Our key priority now is to work with the displaced residents to get them safely home as soon as possible."" One person was treated for smoke inhalation but no other injuries were reported. The Esplanade remained closed at the junctions with West Street and Lennox Street and the closure was likely to remain in place throughout the day and potentially into the week, police said. The blaze is being investigated. Some local residents described the restaurant as selling the best fish and chips in Bognor.

"The 240-turbine Atlantic Array would be double the size of any windfarm currently operating in Britain. The EC confirmed it is taking up the matter with the UK Government due to the ""failure to propose protection sites for the harbour porpoise"". A Defra spokesperson they were working to identify further sites. A letter from Gunter Raad, acting head of environment directorate of the European Commission, said they had received a ""wide-ranging complaint"". ""As a result of our investigations we have now decided to follow this matter up with infringement action,"" the statement said. Mr Raad said the EC was now waiting for a reply from the relevant UK authorities. 'Extensive survey' The EC raised their concerns following a World Wildlife Fund (WWF) report into the delay to designate sites as Special Areas of Conservation, which identifies six possible sites around the UK for the protection of harbour porpoise. The EC warned that the delay has meant that potentially damaging activities are being allowed to progress, potentially without sufficient regard to the needs for the protection of the species. Developer RWE npower said in a statement: ""We have carried out extensive ecological survey work, site investigations and consultation. ""The results and findings have helped shape the development of the wind farm design which we have taken forward into the application. ""Detailed assessment of potential impacts upon marine mammals conclude the proposed wind farm would have no significant adverse effects on Harbour Porpoise."" A Defra spokesperson said: ""We are working to identify further sites to protect this important species in line with EU requirements."" A number of measures had already been taken, they said, ""including introducing measures to prevent accidental entanglement in fishing nets"". Joanne Bell, spokesperson for campaigners Save Our Marine Mammals, said: ""There are a massive amount of harbour porpoises in the Bristol Channel. ""We've been told the EC is taking infringement orders against the UK government, because they believe, as we do, they haven't done enough to protect the porpoises. They haven't designated any special areas of conservation."" The scheme, which would see the 220-metre high turbines built nine miles (16km) off the North Devon coast, was rejected by North Devon Council earlier this month. However Torridge's District Council planning committee voted not to oppose the Atlantic Array. Now independent councillor Chris Leather has put forward a new motion, calling on the council not to support the project. That motion is due to be debated by the full council on 23 September. The proposal will be considered by the Government's Planning Inspectorate, which is responsible for deciding large-scale infrastructure projects.",['The European Commission (EC) has launched an investigation into whether a major windfarm off the Devon coast could endanger wildlife.'],['The European Commission has taken infringement action against a proposed wind farm in Devon.'],0.3529411764705882,0.125,0.3529411764705882,0.3529411764705882,35.45608560579966
"It is believed the patient contracted the infection while visiting Nigeria, Public Health England (PHE) said. According to the World Health Organisation, the condition is similar to human smallpox and although it is much milder, it can be fatal. The patient has been transferred to a specialist infectious disease centre at Guy's and St Thomas' in London. What is monkeypox? PHE and NHS officials said they had been implementing ""rapid infection control procedures"" and contacting passengers who travelled in close proximity to the patient on the same flight to the UK. ""We are following up with those who have had close contact with the patient to offer advice and to monitor them as necessary,"" said Dr Meera Chand, consultant microbiologist at PHE. PHE says the infection is usually a self-limiting illness and most people recover within a few weeks, however severe illness can occur in some individuals. The infection does not spread easily between people and the risk to the general public in England is very low. This is not the first time the virus has been detected in the UK. The first reported cases in the UK were in September 2018. The first patient to be diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK had been staying at a naval base in Cornwall.

"By Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter The rise in prices will ""accelerate rapidly"" during 2017 as the fall in sterling is passed on to consumers, according to the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR). The revised figure is sharply higher than the 3% it forecast in August. The economy also faces ""significant risks"" that could restrict growth. ""Households have really got a choice. Do they spend less or do they start saving less?"" Dr Angus Armstrong, director of macroeconomics at NIESR, told the BBC's Today programme. He said given the savings ratio was at its lowest level since 2008, ""the most likely scenario is that they spend much less, hence the weaker [growth] forecast for next year."" Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rose to 1% in September, up from 0.6% in August, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said last month. That was the highest rate for nearly two years as the cost of clothes, petrol and hotel rooms increased. Inflation means inflation, but who wins? Q&A: Inflation explained The Bank of England is expected to raise its forecasts for inflation in its quarterly Inflation Report on Thursday. The pound has fallen sharply against the dollar and euro since the Brexit vote and NIESR expected sterling to remain at about $1.22 and €1.11 both this year and next.

Recent price increases blamed on falling pound The cost of a cuppa: Typhoo tea, which imports all its tea leaves, said the sharp fall in the pound meant it had no choice but to increase prices Marmite and Pot Noodles: Food manufacturer Unilever says the pound's drop forced it to raise the wholesale price of these and many of its other products, which some supermarkets have passed on to customers Wine: Online wine retailer Naked Wines said it would raise the cost of its wine by 5% from November because of increasing import costs linked to sterling Rising prices for clothes, hotel rooms and petrol drove the official rate of inflation to 1% in September, its highest level for almost two years Model trains: Hornby and Dapol have both said they've increased prices between 10 and 20% due to the higher cost of imports Apple has increased the prices of its laptop and desktop computers in the UK by hundreds of pounds citing currency fluctuations as one of the reasons Microsoft said some of its UK business service prices would go up by 22% in 2017, reflecting the pound's weakened value against the euro 'Hefty price rises' Simon Kirby, head of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting at NIESR, said the fall in sterling had been the most striking feature of the economic landscape since the EU referendum. ""This will pass through into consumer prices over the coming months and quarters,"" he said. ""While we expect this to be only a temporary phenomenon, it will nonetheless weigh on the purchasing power of consumers over the next couple of years."" The last time CPI inflation hit 4% was in 2011, before falling back over the last five years. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""NIESR is right to warn that households are about to endure a renewed period of falling living standards due to soaring inflation. ""Fuel, food and technology prices already are rising in response to the weaker pound, and hefty price rises will be seen across the whole spectrum of consumer goods next year."" Although the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is not likely to raise interest rates in response, according to Mr Tombs, he said that the fall in sterling meant the MPC had little room to manoeuvre. NIESR predicted that the economy would expand by 2% in 2016 - higher than its previous forecast of 1.7% - but would fall to just 1.4% growth next year. ""Rather than a significant change to our view of the future, this is largely due to revisions to historic data,"" it said. 'Heightened uncertainties' Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said inflation hitting 4% would result in ""a major squeeze on consumer purchasing power"". That could then make GDP growth of 1.4% in 2017 ""hard to achieve given the likely heightened uncertainties"" once the UK starts Brexit negotiations, he said. Lower growth along with uncertainty could affect hiring by companies, NIESR warned. It expected unemployment to peak at 5.6% next year, before gradually falling. The think tank also predicted that inflation would only return to the Bank of England's target of 2% in 2020. NIESR is the UK's oldest independent economic research body and was founded in 1938.","['UK inflation will quadruple to about 4% in the second half of next year and cut disposable income, a leading think tank has forecast.']",['The Bank of England is raising its inflation forecast for the second year in a row.'],0.4,0.052631578947368425,0.25,0.25,28.148352011675538
"It's the first time a rap song has won both categories - although Gambino did not attend or perform at the event. He was the first artist to be absent from collecting one of the ""big four"" Grammys since Amy Winehouse in 2008. Gambino - aka actor Donald Glover - beat competition from Drake, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in both categories. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's All The Stars, Brandi Carlile's The Joke and The Middle by Zedd, Maren Morris and Grey were also up for both awards. This Is America, which was accompanied by a symbolic music video, sparked debate when it was released in May. It looked at the representation of black people in America and the prejudices they faced. While record of the year recognises everyone involved in a song, including the artist, producers and engineers, song of the year is awarded to the writer. This Is America co-writer Ludwig Goransson collected the awards on Gambino's behalf. He said he did not know why Gambino had declined to attend but explained how important recognising rap and hip-hop artists at the Grammys was. ""I think if you listen to the radio or if you just watch our culture, if you look at the most downloaded, streamed artists... you see what people are getting inspired by,"" said Goransson backstage. ""It's about time that something like this happened with the Grammys. They're getting the same kind of senses as the people."" In addition to song of the year and record of the year, This Is America won awards for best music video and best rap/sung collaboration. Rapper 21 Savage, one of the collaborators on the track, was unable to attend the ceremony because he is being detained by US officials over an expired visa.

"By Eleanor Gruffydd-JonesBBC Politics Wales AM Angela Burns and the charity UK Sepsis Trust said help for survivors was non-existent. They want patients to be given more information when they are discharged and follow-up help with their recovery. More than 10,000 people get sepsis each year in Wales and about 2,000 of them die, the charity said. People get sepsis when the body attacks itself in response to an infection. Many recover within 18 months, but some suffer serious long-term physical and psychological problems - associated with what is known as ""post-sepsis syndrome"". The UK Sepsis Trust says these include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression, insomnia, poor mobility, fatigue and muscle wasting. Mrs Burns, who speaks on health matters for the Conservatives in the Welsh Assembly, contracted sepsis when she had pneumonia. After being discharged, she said she there was no help for the psychological effects. ""You are very alone. I didn't have any support, I didn't understand, what was going on, and I had never really in my life suffered depression, so that was a new thing for me. ""I know sepsis survivors who have woken up and had their limbs amputated. ""It's like being in a massive road traffic accident where your entire life was turned completely upside-down,"" she said. Mrs Burns said her GP was not told she'd had sepsis, and she needed counselling. ""It was just a rollercoaster ride - I was blindfolded and I had no idea,"" she said. Mrs Burns still has memory loss, fatigue and lower immunity. Terence Canning, from the UK Sepsis Trust, said NHS support for sepsis survivors across Wales ""isn't existent"". ""I think because sepsis is relatively new in terms of health care. It certainly doesn't have the aftercare that, say heart attacks, strokes, cancer would have. It just isn't there for them,"" he said. ""I think early follow-up appointments would be really useful or basic signposting on discharge, even to a charity like Sepsis Trust or support groups, so people can access support early."" Mrs Burns wants patients to be given information packs and GPs to be notified. 'You leave hospital after having sepsis and you get nothing' Cardiff dad Chris Toozer, 45, contracted sepsis twice after stomach and bowel surgery in 2016 and 2017. ""I had PTSD, severe anxiety, weight loss, lots of vitamin deficiencies, and other problems,"" he said. ""Out of desperation I Googled it and found the Sepsis Trust website and I spoke to the nurses there. ""It was the first time in months that I thought, it isn't me feeling thinking all this, this is actually real. ""I started going to the support group meetings then and that's when I found out about post-sepsis syndrome. ""You leave hospital after having sepsis and you get nothing.""

"Youngsters on a Halloween insect hunt found the bug at Craig Gwladus Country Park, near Cilfrew, on 30 October. It has since been identified as the Turdulisoma cf turdulorum millipede, so rare it is only the third known site where it has been found. The first was Aberkenfig, Bridgend, in 2017, by local expert Christian Owen. It was subsequently confirmed as a new species by Dr Jörg Spelda at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Germany. All findings have been in south Wales, with the Craig Gwladus discovery uncovered among leaf litter and under old wood along the former Gelliau Colliery Tramroad at the park. Liam Olds, from conservation group Buglife Cymru, said sites associated with Wales' coalmining heritage were ""very important places for rare and scarce animal and plant species, especially invertebrates"". He added: ""Discoveries such as this highlight the importance of such sites and why they need to be conserved. ""As the species is new to science, we know nothing about it. ""It could be a native species that has been previously overlooked because so few people record invertebrates in south Wales, or it could have been an introduced species from abroad.""

"The family said they could not have afforded a QC themselves after the Legal Aid Agency decided the case ""was not in the public interest"". Seven-year-old Zane Gbangbola died at his home next to the Thames in Chertsey, Surrey on 8 February 2014. The coroner is to deliver his verdict on 6 or 7 September. Over five weeks, the inquest heard detailed scientific evidence about what gas may have killed the boy. A post-mortem examination suggested it could have been carbon monoxide fumes from a petrol-driven pump used to clear floodwater from the premises. But the hearing was told the amount of carbon monoxide in his blood was significantly lower than fatal. Zane's parents believe he was killed by hydrogen cyanide in floodwater polluted by a former landfill site to the rear of their home. The family's campaign managed to raise £70,000 to hire a lawyer, including £25,000 from an anonymous supporter. Zane's mother Nicole Lawler said: ""We could not have done it on our own. There is absolutely no way we could have represented ourselves. And without the funding the public put together to help us get a QC, we really did not stand a chance.""

"By Meredith BakerBBC News, Johannesburg But the surge in mobile phone use - there are currently 695 million mobile phone subscribers in Africa - has given Africans a simple and pervasive means of sharing information and conducting business. In recent years, a few innovative African companies have found ways to harness the e-potential of mobile commerce and information sharing, changing the way in which Africans communicate and conduct business. SlimTrader, founded by Nigerian-American Femi Akinde, is an e-commerce firm that is meant to ease the exchange of goods and widen the online markets for Africans. Mr Akinde and the SlimTrader team created Mobiashara, a mobile technology that allows users to search for and purchase products via text message. This technology provides retailer's information and inventory, and also partners with mobile payment providers such as M-PESA and MTN so someone can make a purchase with a press of a button on their mobile device. With partners such as Aero Airlines, SlimTrader even facilitates once complicated transactions such as buying plane tickets. Umuntu Media is another African-based host website that caters to the mobile world. Umuntu was founded only one and a half years ago by Johan Nel, a native of Namibia. The idea of Umuntu, Mr Nel explains, is to ""close the local content gap, to provide users with information that is useful to them."" Umuntu provides local news, job listings, and directories specific to each country and region in which it operates. After only 18 months of operation, Umuntu has portals in nine countries, and its Namibia portal, iNamibia, is already the largest local website in Namibia. Brainchild After Umuntu took off in web and mobile form, Mr Nel had a vision to use it as a springboard to further tap into mobile e-commerce with the creation of the mobile site, Mimiboard, which has been live for a month. Mimiboard ('mimi' means 'I' in Swahili) is Mr Nel's brainchild to deliver hyper-local content in the form of a traditional notice board. First, a mimiboard is created for a specific area. People in each community can post a notice to Mimiboard about wanting to buy or sell something, and then someone else can purchase the service posted through mimiboard. ""For example,"" Mr Nel explains, ""a fisherman in Mombasa can post about his catch of the day to mimiboard, then other users in the area can go buy the fish."" It uses the same technology that radio and TV stations use to feed live streams of texts from listeners and viewers and can be accessed through text, android phones, and online. Not only is mimiboard linked to the Umuntu sites of each country, but students from four big universities in Kenya have already started using Mimiboard as a platform to buy and sell textbooks - and a university dean in Canada has also inquired about using the product. Mimiboard is creating a space for local mobile notices while also creating new ways for users to earn money. The Mimiboard team has created its own currency, mimibucks, which incentivizes mobile transactions for users. In Mr Nel's words: ""If someone wants to sell their car through a specific mimiboard, the person who created that mimiboard will receive a micropayment for the transaction."" He anticipates that Mimiboard will have a million users in the next ten months with the help of mobile bank and mobile advertising collaborations. Mobile demographic One such collaboration of Umuntu/Mimiboard is the relationship the company has with Primedia Online, which represents Umuntu in the digital ad business. Primedia Online supplies tailored news content in portals across the southern continent, in addition to providing technology and ad business to local publishers wanting to tap into the mobile market. Primedia business development manager Susan Hansford explains that advertising on mobile phones is more competitive now amongst companies. ""E-commerce shouldn't be in desktop form for Africa, I think the focused efforts on the mobile side of e-commerce will change the way business is done in this continent,"" she says. ""It should be noted however that the mobile demographic is a little different than e-commerce on computers, which would be more middle and upper class."" The mobile demographic is expanded to consist of people in small villages, and so it wouldn't make financial sense for an advertiser of high-priced consumer goods to advertise to this demographic. Ms Hansford notes that the mobile environments in Africa are better suited to financial services, citing cheap funeral insurance and student loans as some of the top mobile advertisers. Although problems arise in the mobile e-commerce world such as product delivery, Africa has made great strides in conducting business online and on handhelds. Companies like Umuntu and SlimTrader have seen the opportunity for Africa on mobiles, an opportunity unique to Africa because of the importance of business at the micro-level, and the lack of other forms of technology. As Mr Nel puts it: ""This type of technology we are working to develop is one that we hope will solve African problems while putting Africa on the map for innovative solutions.""","['Across the African continent, internet penetration is low, computers are often too expensive to purchase, and online business transactions can be logistically complicated to execute.']","['Mobile e-commerce is not in desktop form for Africa - it should be in mobile form, says Susan Hansford.']",0.0909090909090909,0.0,0.0909090909090909,0.0909090909090909,12.719625927208469

He said: ""We're a family run home and have always prided ourselves on our attention to detail. ""The new national guidelines have meant that only very limited visits are allowed for palliative care and the majority of residents can only have Zoom calls. ""But that's just not the same. ""We thought we could come up with a better solution than some of the outdoor sheds that we'd seen - especially as it's getting cold. We did not think that was very dignified."" He said the pod has been fully booked by families for the 30-minute slots which allow for full cleaning between visits. Mr Singh has built another which will start to be used by some of the home's 65 residents next week. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The six-week-old male bird was found at Loch Arkaig in Lochaber. The Scottish SPCA first took the chick to Inverness and then to its national rescue centre in Alloa for treatment. It will remain with the animal charity until it fledges at about 12-weeks-old and will then be released near the loch. The hooks were removed during a surgical procedure.

"LGSS Law is owned by three councils and was founded to offer a ""new model"" for public sector legal services. Critics called the fall in revenue and £1.2m loss in 2018-19 a concern while an independent councillor questioned the scrutiny of outsourced services. LGSS Law said its finances had improved and it expected a profit this year. The law company is owned by Central Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire county and Cambridgeshire county councils. Last year the BBC revealed Northamptonshire had offered the firm a £1m overdraft. It has now emerged Cambridgeshire has offered an extra £499,000 credit line. LGSS Law's revenue in 2018-19 fell from £8.7m to £7.8m and its losses grew from £300,000 to £1.2m. In its annual accounts, LGSS Law said: ""The directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. ""However, the directors are aware of certain material uncertainties which may cause doubt on the company's ability to continue as a going concern."" 'Reliant on shareholders' It is understood these ""uncertainties"" include cash flow management and the financial issues in setting up the business. The firm said it ""continues to be reliant on the support of its shareholders in the firm in the form of loans, overdrafts and trade payable balances"". It said it was pursuing higher-margin lines of business, increasing the efficiency of its fee-earning lawyers and increasing its headcount ""in response to higher workload volumes"". Adam Zerny, leader of the Independent group on Central Bedfordshire Council, said: ""It is a real concern to see losses at LGSS Law rise to £1.2m, especially when this represents 15% of the company's turnover. ""I have significant concerns about outsourcing to a third party which cannot be scrutinised in the same way a local authority can. I remain strongly opposed to legal services being outsourced."" Northamptonshire County Council - twice forced to stop all non-essential spending in 2018 - said it offered the 1.62% per annum overdraft, of which £950,000 has been used, to help the firm's cash flow. It is understood £375,000 of the Cambridgeshire overdraft has been drawn down. A Cambridgeshire council spokeswoman said: ""The purpose of the overdraft facility is to provide a working capital to ensure the law firm avoids any cash flow difficulty in the 'lag' between work, billing and receipt of payment."" Debbie Carter-Hughes, executive director at LGSS Law, said the latest accounts were out of date, adding ""the firm has made significant changes to its financial position"" and was ""forecasting a profit for the end of the financial year"".

"By Laurence CawleyBBC News That search, which took place on Sunday and Monday, has now been called off after they were unable to ""find any trace of any animal"". The most likely explanation for the sighting now appears to be that the suspected big cat was Ginny Murphy's pet Teddy Bear, a three-year-old Maine Coon cat. The drama, which unfolded over the bank holiday, has amused those for whom tracking big cats is a day job. Rich Laburn, of the Londolozi Game Reserve in South Africa's Kruger National Park, told BBC News there are simple things to look out for - the most obvious being paw prints. 'Listen for growl' ""They are unmistakeable,"" he said. ""If you take your hand and spread it out on the floor, then the circumference of a man sized hand will be about the size of a male lion's paw print. ""A female lion's paw is slightly smaller,"" said Mr Laburn. ""You can also look for dirt inside the tracks as other creatures have moved over it - that will give you an indication of how fresh the tracks are,"" said Mr Laburn. Asked whether the recently well-watered soils of Essex would be a harder place to find lion paw tracks, Mr Laburn said: ""No, in the mud it will be easier. We find that tracks left in the mud of river beds are the easiest to track."" He told how trackers, once they have found their lions, had to listen ""very closely"" for the sound of a growl. ""A lion will growl a warning,"" he said, ""and the growl will get louder as a person gets nearer. ""Eventually, it will either run away or it will charge at you,"" he said. ""And you don't want a lion to charge at you.""","['When police learned a suspected lion was on the loose in an Essex village, they brought in helicopters with thermal imaging kit and experts from a nearby zoo.']",['A search for a big cat in Essex has been called off after it was found in the mud of a river bed.'],0.27450980392156865,0.0,0.19607843137254902,0.19607843137254902,16.229126369121357
"Conner Marshall, 18, was beaten to death at Trecco Bay in Porthcawl in March 2015. Killer David Braddon, who was 26 at the time, pleaded guilty to murder and is serving a life sentence. Braddon was subject to two community orders at the time. A Pontypridd inquest into Mr Marshall's death heard Braddon had repeatedly missed appointments to supervise his behaviour. During the hearing, probation officer Kathryn Oakley broke down and said she had been given an impossible job. The court heard she was new to the role and Braddon was her first case. She was employed by Wales Community Rehabilitation Company. The barrister for the Marshall family, Kirsten Heaven, asked Ms Oakley if she told the probation service when Braddon, who was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, had stopped taking his antidepressant medication without talking to his GP. Ms Oakley said she had encouraged Braddon to speak to his doctor. She was then asked whether she would have handled the situation differently. Ms Oakley broke down and said: ""In an ideal world I wish I had. But I did the best I could under the heavy workload."" ""You're talking about an impossible task."" The inquest heard that Braddon had drug and alcohol issues. He had missed a treatment appointment and was still drinking. Ms Oakley said she was unaware of the missed appointment because she was on holiday in Mexico at the time. Ms Heaven asked her: ""You were told he was drinking four cans a night and you were told alcohol led to an increased risk of harm. Why were alarm bells not ringing?"" Ms Oakley said she ""was a bit concerned about that"" but said because of the pressure of the workload it meant she did not investigate this further, which she would have normally done if she wasn't having to deal with 60 separate cases. Ms Oakley told the court she felt let down by her employer. The inquest continues.",['A probation officer who had been monitoring a serial offender when he went on to murder a teenager told an inquest she did the best she could under the heavy workload.'],"['A probation officer has told a court she was ""an impossible task"" to deal with the case of a teenage killer who killed his friend.']",0.3928571428571428,0.07407407407407407,0.21428571428571427,0.21428571428571427,31.57244988030975
"By Gerry HoltBBC News Sometimes seen as a ""working-class gong"", the BEM was founded in 1917 and was awarded for ""meritorious"" actions whether by civilians or military personnel. But the honour was scrapped in 1993 by former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, as part of his drive towards a ""classless"" society. However, nearly two decades on, the prime minister has announced its revival, and from next year, to coincide with the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, about 300 will be awarded annually to community volunteers. The families of those who received the honour the first time round have welcomed the move - as long as it remains the ""unsung heroes"" who are recognised. 'Unexploded bomb' Mabel Siddal was honoured with the medal for her bravery as a 22-year-old air raid warden in Devonport, Plymouth, during World War II. She pulled survivors from devastated homes during the Blitz - even as attacks continued around her. The citation for her award, which she received in 1942, states: ""Madam, I recently drew the attention of the Minister of Home Security to your gallant conduct when during the severe air raids on Plymouth and district on the nights of 21, 22 and 29 April 1941 you rescued people from bombed houses while raiding was still going on, fought fires, evacuated a number of people from the area where an unexploded bomb had fallen, and generally behaved in a resourceful and courageous manner in circumstances of great danger with complete disregard for your own comfort and safety."" Her daughter Barbara Roche described her mother's actions as ""amazing"" and said the BEM had been a source of great pride. Mrs Siddal died last year at the age of 92. Mrs Roche welcomed the revival of the honour, but added: ""As long as it goes back to the concept of it being an award for services to the community, which very much was the case for my mum, then I have no problem with it. ""I think it had become devalued before it was abolished - the prime example was that it was given to Margaret Thatcher's cleaner, according to the newspapers, and mum was really irate about that."" Armed terrorists Douglas Hogg's story is as equally hair-raising as that of Mrs Siddal's. As a young young police officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary during the late 1960s, he chased a gang of armed terrorists from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland. The terrorists had previously robbed two banks in the town - now city - of Newry, County Down. ""I was unarmed at the time and I was briefly captured by them and made to plead for my life,"" explained Mr Hogg, who told how the men held a gun to his head. He was only saved after some children passed by and he pleaded with his assailants not to kill him until they had gone. They later let him go. Mr Hogg said of the honour: ""Being 24 years of age it is not often that you get a gallantry medal presented by the Queen."" He said he was surprised when the BEM was abolished, and added: ""I think people got the impression then - wrongly or rightly - that to receive an MBE you needed 'greater qualifications'."" He said bringing back the BEM was an ""excellent idea"" because it offered an opportunity for more people to receive a bravery medal. A search through the BBC News archives throws up many tales of local heroes who received the BEM. Take Henry ""Shrimp"" Davies, a lifeboatman who saved about 500 lives during more than 30 years as coxswain of the Cromer lifeboat. He was awarded the medal in 1970 for ""maintaining the highest traditions of the lifeboat service"". Margaret Miller was recognised with the BEM for services to her community through volunteering for more than 70 years. She began working with the WRVS, helping older people remain active and independent in the community, in Glasgow in 1939. Dale Howting, a former postman, who cycled hundreds of miles on the same spot in Roman Square, Sittingbourne, was honoured with the BEM for his charity work. Mr Howting raised more than £200,000 over 30 years. 'Very brave' William Craddy was awarded the BEM in 1946 for ""meritorious conduct"" during World War II. His son, also named William, said his father received the honour for an ""accumulation of acts of bravery, quick thinking, morale-raising and compassion"". ""In order to get any sort of medal an act of bravery performed needed to have been witnessed by an officer,"" says Mr Craddy, 63, from Leeds, whose father died aged 76 in 2004. ""Now that never happened with my dad although from the various stories told about him (we knew) he was an extremely brave man. ""He never got a medal other than the campaign medals but at the time we lived in a small village called Ormesby and the local people there gathered some stories about my dad and they passed them all to the Lord Lieutenant. He recommended my father for the BEM and it was awarded in 1946."" Mr Craddy recounted several of the stories that led to his father, who became an RAF sergeant, being honoured. ""The regiment was on a forced march in wet, muddy, terrible conditions and had marched for miles and miles. One of the men said to my dad 'Christ, sarge, how much further? I'm walking on my knees', to which my father replied: 'Never mind your knees, I'm walking on my cap badge'. This comment caused much laughter and being overheard by an officer, earned my dad a Mention in Despatches for keeping up morale,"" said Mr Craddy. Mr Craddy, a father-of-five, also pulled the body of one of his comrades to safety on the door of a cow shed after he was fatally shot by a sniper close to a German airfield. And on another occasion he saved lives when his regiment was trapped at one end of a German minefield. ""He remembered from a commando course that the Germans used a particular network of ropes to mark out mines and everywhere there was a knot there was a mine - he quickly told the commanding officer that he knew the pattern,"" said Mr Craddy. The former steel worker did not even mention that he had received the honour until the 50th anniversary of VE day. ""I'm not saying he was exceptional - he only did what thousands of other men probably did - but he was a very, very brave man,"" said his son. ""That's exactly what the BEM was for and yes, bring it back so the many unsung heroes of today can be recognised.""","['After Prime Minister David Cameron announced the return of the British Empire Medal (BEM), we tell the stories of some of the local heroes who were honoured the first time round.']","['The British Army has reintroduced the BEM, a commemorative medal for services to the community.']",0.26086956521739135,0.045454545454545456,0.17391304347826086,0.17391304347826086,18.723098340779195
"By Tara JohnBBC News Condolences flooded social media from journalists, businessmen academics, ambassadors and even flag-carrying Ethiopian Airlines after it was reported that Mr Simegnew's body was found in a car in the capital, Addis Ababa, on Thursday. The police are investigating the circumstances of his death. He died as a result of a bullet wound and a hand gun was found in his car, which was parked in Meskel Square in the city centre. By the afternoon, hundreds had taken to the streets in the capital, as well as Mr Simegnew's hometown of Gondar, with protesters demanding ""justice"" for the late engineer. To understand why a project manager has managed to elicit such shock and widespread mourning - normally seen in other countries after the death of royalty, celebrities or politicians - one has to look at what the Grand Ethiopian Dam has come to represent. 'Patriotic ambitions' Straddling the Nile, the dam has been called the most ambitious infrastructure project ever achieved on the continent. Once built, the 1.8km (1.1 mile) wide and 155m (500ft 5in) high dam will triple the country's electricity production. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is set to be Africa's biggest hydropower plant, is one of a number of large-scale infrastructure projects aimed at putting Ethiopia on course to become a middle-income nation by 2025. Its scale and potential has brought rare unity in the country, which has faced political and ethnic strife over the years, Beletu Bulbula Sorsu, editor of BBC's Afaan Oromo Service, says. ""The project unites Ethiopians,"" she says. Matina Stevis-Gridneff, Africa correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who knew Mr Simegnew, says he has come to represent these patriotic ambitions. ""He was someone who was extremely patriotic and had devoted his life to the betterment of his country,"" she told the BBC'S Focus on Africa radio programme. ""He seemed to have devoted his entire life to Ethiopia's future by contributing what he could, which was his engineering skills."" Not a 'big man' The 53-year-old gained his degree in civil engineering from Addis Ababa University and went on to to lead two other dam projects - Gilgel Gibe I and Gilgel Gibe II dams. He came to the public's attention in 2011, when he was put in charge of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Ms Beletu says he was frequently interviewed by the press and was widely perceived as being uncorrupted, modest and accessible. ""He was not a 'big man,'"" she says of Mr Simegnew's honest nature. ""He behaved as if he was one of the the labourers working on the project."" Read more Tibebeselassie Tigabu, from the BBC's Amharic Service, interviewed Mr Simegnew days before he died. ""He gave his life for the dam,"" she says, explaining that he spent most of his time around the dam, which was located in Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region near Sudan, nearly 1,000km north-west of his home in Addis Ababa. ""It is a difficult place to live and he had been there for more than six years,"" she adds. A man of symbols Mr Simegnew became the symbol of the dam and his death might become emblematic of the problems facing the project. ""He was the spokesman for the project, he was the front man and I am not sure how that will be replaced so easily,"" Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. The dam is believed to be 60% complete, but there has been growing anger over delays. In the last week of July, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said that at the current pace of construction the dam might not be completed in the next 10 years. Ethiopians are proud of the fact that the dam is a largely self-financed project. But a dollar shortage crisis has slowed down its construction, Ms Stevis-Gridneff says. Then there is geopolitical tension the dam has created downstream with Egypt worried that the infrastructure project will put a strain on its water supply. ""While the project is coming into trouble for practical reasons, I also see his death as a real blow to the symbolism of this project and how it was recorded in the psyche of normal Ethiopians,"" she says. Mr Simegnew was expected to be buried a day after his death. But a statement by a national committee set up to organise his funeral said it had postponed the burial. They have instead made arrangements for a bigger funeral on Sunday 29 July ""that a national hero like him deserves"".","['The death of Simegnew Bekele, the project manager of the multi-billion-dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, has been met by an outpouring of grief in Ethiopia.']","[""Ethiopia's Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has become a symbol of the country's political and social tensions.""]",0.3555555555555555,0.23255813953488372,0.26666666666666666,0.26666666666666666,35.015254908717715
"Haniffa Bin Osman, 57, was sentenced to 37 months in prison by the district judge in Baltimore on Friday. He was accused of aiding the LTTE in the attempted purchase of Surface to Air Missiles, Night Vision of Devices, Machine Guns and State of the Art Firearms.

"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent, Bremen They have been examining rocks from the crater that the 15km-wide space object dug out of what is now the Gulf of Mexico some 66 million years ago. The team says it can see evidence in these materials for how life returned to the scene soon after the calamity. Descendants of these small organisms are likely thriving today in amongst the crater's smashed up materials. The international project has shipped the hundreds of metres it drilled from beneath the Gulf floor earlier this year to the MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, at the University of Bremen, Germany. It is here that the cores are being catalogued, analysed and archived. Chicxulub Crater - The impact that changed life on Earth Prof Sean Gulick, from the University of Texas, US, is one of the two chief scientists involved. He cautioned that the rock investigation was a long-term endeavour, but then shared some early observations. ""We've been able to examine that first 10,000 years after the impact, which is dominated by what we call 'disaster species' - dominated by the organisms that love stressed environments. And then we can see evolution coming back in [during] the next few hundred thousands years after that,"" he told BBC News. The ""disaster species"" that left their fossil traces in the rocks are tiny plankton-type organisms, such as particular forms of dinoflagellates. But of considerable delight for the research team is evidence in the cores for what may be current biology. These deep-living cells would be the descendants of organisms that invaded pore spaces and cracks through which hot fluids flowed. Similar life-sustaining hydrothermal systems are seen at volcanic vents at mid-ocean ridges. ""We've got some cell counts and some DNA, but it's all very early days; we're very concerned about contamination,"" explained Prof Jo Morgan. ""But the signs are that, yes, this crater was occupied soon after the impact."" These are moments to treasure for the Imperial College London scientist. She had lobbied for 16 years to get the drill project approved and funded. It was conducted just off the Mexican coast during April and May. The drill mechanism got to 1,335m below the modern sea floor. For its first 600m, it had to push through typical ocean sediments that have built up since the impact. But then, in the lower part of the hole, it hit the true rocks that make up the Chicxulub Crater, as it has become known. ""They're very strange rocks,"" said Prof Morgan. ""The rocks have formed this feature: it's called a 'peak ring'. They're very, very highly… what we call 'shocked'. Shock pressures of many tens of gigapascals have deformed the rocks. They're also highly fractured, and have moved long distances. So, even though they're made of granite-type rocks, they're amazingly different to anything else we see in the world."" With Prof Gulick, Prof Morgan has assembled a 35-strong team to begin the process of unpacking the cores in Bremen. Little chunks of rock are being cut and bagged to be sent to labs all across the globe. Various team-members will lead specific inquiries. The goal, broadly speaking, is to understand better how the crater formed, the energy involved in its excavation, and the volume of material that was dispersed. This will put new limits on the nature of the environmental changes that overtook the Earth and sent so many species - not just the dinosaurs - into oblivion. Prof Gulick told BBC News: ""So, we think that this investigation will give us answers to some fundamental questions that people have been asking for decades, like the energy of the impact, maybe some information about the kill mechanisms that caused the mass extinction, and also fundamentally about how impact processes work [and] how impacts affect all planets in the rocky part of the Solar System."" Only about a half of the recovered crater rocks are being used for the current study. The rest are being stored in the archive for a time when lab equipment is more advanced than it is today. It is certain that future teams will propose additional ideas about the impact which they will test with analytical tools not yet invented. The expedition to drill into Chicxulub Crater was conducted by the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD) as part of the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP). The expedition was also supported by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP). Formal results will be published in a slew of scholarly papers that should start appearing very soon. Topics of early interest will include the possibility that some vestige of the impactor itself can be found in the cores. A telltale of this meteoritic material will likely be high levels of the element iridium. The scientists should also be able to comment on the tsunamis that occurred when the asteroid struck what was then a shallow sea. Colossal volumes of water would have sloshed back and forth and this action ought to be recorded in cascades of sediment.

"Robert PestonEconomics editor One reason why this bank should stay afloat is because Co-op Group is injecting £462m into it. But even so, Co-op Group will emerge with a holding in the bank of just 30%. Or to put it another way, the value of its current 100% ownership of the bank is being valued at a big fat zilch. This destruction of Co-op Group's investment in the bank stems from a merger with Britannia Building Society in 2009 that has spewed losses, massive wasted investment in IT and from not generating enough profit out of the better operations to meet regulators' requirements for the capital it needs as a buffer against potential future losses. If the rescue happens, the remaining 70% of Co-op Bank will henceforth be held by hedge funds and other investors. Their £942m of loans to the group - or more precisely, their holdings of bonds classified as ""lower tier 2 capital"" under the Basel classification (stay with me!) are being converted into shares. And they are also putting £125m of cash into the bank. Oh my goodness, hedge funds in charge of the UK's most ethical bank! Whatever next? Well the hedgies - led by Aurelius, Silver Point and Monarch - insist they are not on a mission to turn Co-op Bank into just any old bank, or worse - unless, that is, any old bank wouldn't spill red ink on the scale of the Co-op in recent years (err yes, any old bank has done that too). The important point is that the professional investors don't want to lose any or all of Co-op Bank's staggeringly loyal 4.7 million customers, who have stuck with the group through all the uncertainties about its future in recent months, but might take their money and custom elsewhere if Co-op Bank decided not to be very co-operative and moral in future. So as part of the deal to save the bank, its constitution or articles of association are being rewritten, to state that it must behave ethically. A new independent committee, reporting to the bank's board, will be the guardian of this ethical culture. And Co-op Group will have the right to strip the bank of the ""Co-op"" moniker if it starts lending money to clubbers of seal pups or in any other way doesn't behave as its customers would want. But to be clear, Co-op Group is not yet saved. For the rescue to be formalised, its creditors must vote for it - and the logistics of securing their approval are horribly complicated. On the plus side, the hedgies controlling 48% by value of the lower tier 2 capital have said yes. But what's actually required of those creditors is an assent from 75% by value and just over 50% by number. There also have to be three separate votes of holders of the upper tier 2 capital, and they include up to 18,000 retail investors, many of whom are not experienced or sophisticated investors. Herding them will not be easy - and yet two-thirds of them must vote and 75% by value must vote in favour for the rescue to take effect. In theory, those retail investors - who have been represented by the financial campaigner Mark Taber - have got a deal closer to what they wanted than Co-op Group's initial proposal. Back then they were being offered shares in the bank. But this horrified many of them, who had come to depend on the fat interest being paid on their preference shares and perpetual subordinated bonds (known as pibs). So Co-op Group is now offering them a couple of options: the chance to receive a decent tax-free income for 12 years, but with no repayment of principal at the end of the 12 years, or an immediate write-off of between 15% and 40% of the value of the bonds and a continuing interest payment of 11% on what's left. Mr Taber tells me he is happy with what Co-op has now put on the table, but he concedes that it will be hard work securing the requisite majorities. Co-op Group is putting pressure on creditors to agree in two different ways. First, it is saying the upper tier two creditors - who comprise the bulk of the ordinary or retail investors - will get 8% less if they don't agree to the terms before 16:30 GMT on 29 November. And it has today formally told all creditors that the alternative to this rescue is resolution or takeover by the Bank of England. Here's Co-op being less cuddly than is its wont: ""If the Bank were to enter into a bank insolvency or administration procedure following resolution, all holders of the existing securities would receive no recovery at all."" Now Co-op would not have issued that warning to bondholders, that saying ""no"" would mean wipe-out, without consulting the Bank of England. Ouch. And one final thing. In an attempt to restore profits, Co-op Bank is closing around 50 branches, or around 15% out of 324. That will lead to many hundreds of job losses, maybe 1000. But don't blame supposedly ruthless hedge funds for that. The Co-op had already embarked on that cost-cutting exercise (10 of the 50 branches have already gone). The new management of the group, in place for just six months, inherited the kind of mess where the survival of the bank required them to behave in a less co-operative way than they might have liked.","[""It is a humiliating day for Co-op Group, or at least its previous management, because there is confirmation in today's rescue deal for Co-op Bank that the value of the bank has collapsed to nothing.""]","['If Co-op Bank is rescued from insolvency, it will be the second time in three years that it has been rescued by hedge funds and other investors.']",0.2727272727272727,0.0625,0.18181818181818182,0.18181818181818182,24.816182563537957

"By Andrew PickenBBC Scotland News New figures from the administrator of the yard show £49.7m is owed to the Scottish government - nearly £5m more than previously revealed. A total of £426,000 is also owed to HMRC. The Scottish government said it provided two commercial loans totalling £45m to Ferguson Marine, on which interest applies. The new figures also reveal that two partially-built CalMac ships at the centre of the firm's collapse have been valued at £48.3m. That is nearly half the value of the £97m deal agreed to build the ships. BBC Scotland understands that a number of bids have been received for the yard with an update from the administrator Deloitte expected within the next week. Ferguson went into administration following a dispute with Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd - which buys and leases CalMac ships on behalf of the Scottish government - over the construction of two new ferries. The shipyard is operating under a management agreement with administrators, which will see the Scottish government buy Ferguson if no private buyer comes forward. A ""statement of affairs"" produced by Deloitte shows the estimated total assets available for Ferguson Marine is £97.7m, including a £48.3m estimated value for the partially built two CalMac vessels. Ferguson Marine went bust owning more than £73m. Further details from the document show that: 'Catastrophically wrong' Jamie Greene, Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, said report outlined ""just how desperate the finances of the yard are"". ""A full parliamentary inquiry is essential to get to the bottom of why the SNP let things go so catastrophically wrong at Ferguson Marine and come clean over the role they played in its demise,"" he added. A number of potential private buyers have expressed an interest in the Ferguson shipyard and Deloitte has now received bids for the yard, but has not said how many. The monthly wage bill for workers at the yard is being met from Scottish government funds and a new board has been put in place to come up with a plan to finish the delayed CalMac ferries. Economy Secretary Derek Mackay has said details of a ""robust delivery schedule"" for the vessels must be announced by the end of October. ""At all points the Scottish government has acted to ensure the completion of the ferry contracts, the protection of jobs and a future for the Ferguson ship yard and that remains our priority,"" a government spokeswoman said.

"By Ashley DonnellyBBC News, Sydney Mr Charles' manager, Patrice Capogreco, said the actor may take legal action against the drivers and taxi company. The first incident occurred on Wednesday night after a Melbourne event where Mr Charles was declared Victorian Senior Australian of the Year. When Mr Charles tried to get in a taxi the driver allegedly demanded upfront payment because ""he might not pay"". The second incident occurred at Melbourne airport at 15:00 local time Friday (04:00 GMT). Mr Charles was attempting to get inside a taxi when it suddenly drove away, Ms Capogreco told the BBC. ""He's a strong, resilient man and it takes a lot to affect him, but enough is enough,"" she said. The Victorian taxi regulator said it was investigating the case as a matter of priority. ""This type of behaviour is unacceptable and illegal. [We] deplore discrimination and racism of any kind,"" the Taxi Services Commission said in a statement. It said taxi fares must be prepaid for all trips between 22:00 and 05:00. However, Mr Charles had said Wednesday's incident had occurred at around 21:00. In an interview before the second incident, Mr Charles told the BBC it was common for Indigenous Australians to be refused a taxi. He said some Aboriginal Australians were forced to ask strangers to flag taxis down on their behalf. ""We're so used to it ... being abused by this behaviour,"" Mr Charles said. ""White Australia has to get used to the term racial vilification."" The actor had a cameo role in the Warner Brothers Peter Pan sequel film Pan this year. He is best known for his work on Australian films, including Tom White and The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith. Mr Charles is also well known as an Aboriginal elder and role model.

"By George PierpointBBC News The photograph was shared on a local Facebook group, with a caption stating it was ""just another reason... to leave Fayetteville"", along with an angry emoji. However, after it transpired the man was homeless and resting between working two shifts at the fast-food restaurant, the local community decided to offer support, rather than ridicule him. Local reporter Matt Johnson managed to track down the man, Simon Childs, who explained his mother had died recently and he had fallen on hard times. The 21-year-old added that he was raising his young son and trying to provide for his family. ""It kind of hurt to see my picture up there,"" he told WSB-TV. ""I thought it was something negative and nobody would care about it."" Mr Childs' situation spurred his local community to respond with kindness, by donating nappies and clothes for his son. ""I didn't think the community would even care enough to do that, but they care,"" he said. Two chefs from a nearby restaurant offered to loan Mr Childs a car. And a local barber gave him a free haircut in preparation for attending job interviews, Mr Childs told the local news station he had received job offers as a result of the Facebook post and was excited about finding a permanent home for him and his son. Many took to social media to criticise the woman's decision to shame Mr Childs on Facebook. ""It's not cool to shame someone,"" one person wrote. While others said the woman's plan to criticise Mr Childs had ""backfired"". The woman who shared the photo on Facebook told WSB-TV off-camera she had not intended to shame Mr Childs. Others sympathised with the difficulties faced by Mr Childs. One Twitter user wrote that they ""know how it feels to lose a mother and still [have to] deal with the rest of life"". ""You simply don't bring a person down when they are already down,"" they added. Mr Childs' experience is an example of ""stranger-shaming"", which involves posting photos or videos on social media to highlight a behaviour that one finds distasteful. Manspreading, students sleeping at the library, men wearing red trousers and napping commuters have all been the target of ridicule and undercover photography. Many photographs are shared in private groups specifically set up to criticise a particular behaviour.

"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Officials have been long concerned about the future loss of more than £30bn in revenue from drivers. In a new review the Treasury has acknowledged the problem in a way that will spark a debate about how driving should be taxed in the future. One idea would be to charge motorists for every mile they drive. But the AA says such road pricing will be tough to sell politically. Instead, the motoring organisation is proposing a system of ""Road Miles"" in which motorists are allowed to drive free of charge for 3,000 miles (4,000 in rural areas) before they start paying. The Treasury review offers another striking conclusion from a government department traditionally worried about harm to the economy from cleaning up the UK's emissions. The latest message is the opposite - that tackling climate change might even benefit the economy by giving the UK a lead in clean technologies. It says: ""Overall, in the context of the rest of the world decarbonising, the net impact of the transition on growth to 2050 is likely to be small compared to total growth over that period. ""It could be slightly positive or slightly negative."" The document continues: ""Climate change is an existential threat to humanity. Without global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions, the climate will change catastrophically with almost unimaginable consequences for societies across the world."" Environmentalists welcome what they say is a dramatic change in tone from the Treasury, Doug Parr from Greenpeace told BBC News: ""Finally the Treasury has admitted that tackling climate change could actually be good for the economy. ""For years it's been a total drag on climate policies - it used to get in the way of any good proposals."" He said the Treasury should save money by scrapping the £27bn roads programme and the £100bn HS2 rail line - both of which will increase carbon emissions. Nick Mabey from the think tank e3g told BBC News the document raised false fears that the UK would lose industries to nations with dirty economies if the UK decarbonised. He said: ""This report shows the Treasury still has a lot of homework to do to understand the full implications of the clean energy revolution for Britain. ""The report talks about the opportunities of moving to net zero but still underplays the benefits of cleaner air and healthier cities. ""[The Treasury has] still not grasped that British industry is not at risk from dirty imports but from industries powered by cheap solar power in Tunisia, the Gulf and Australia."" ""The obvious implication of this report is that the UK can afford to move faster to reduce climate risks."" But both men praised the Treasury for accepting that the big challenge for climate policy will be fairness, not technology. Its document - an interim review - said poorer people must be protected from the changes in employment and taxation, or the government would lose support for cleaning up emissions. This message was strongly advocated by the Citizens Assembly devised to gauge the opinions of the public on climate policy.","['Taxes must increase or services be cut to compensate for the loss of fuel tax income thanks to the advent of electric cars, the Treasury has admitted.']","['The government has admitted that tackling climate change is a ""total drag"" on the economy.']",0.19047619047619047,0.05,0.14285714285714285,0.14285714285714285,20.44156934295705

"Enthusiasts recreated the original opening of the waterway in 1812 at Pontymoile Basin with church bells sounding along the route. The 49-mile, canal built to transport coal and iron, winds its way south from Brecon to Cwmbran, Newport and Cwmcarn. Today it is popular with tourists on canal boat holidays. At midday a bell was rung at Pontymoile Basin sparking a peal of church bells in both directions along the route with almost 30 churches taking part.

"By Roger HarrabinEnvironment analyst After conducting technical studies, the energy department proposed a subsidy cut of 10% for power from onshore wind. But the chancellor is under pressure from back-benchers to scrap subsidies, and is said to favour a 25% cut. The industry body, Renewable UK, says it may take legal action if the government makes a decision that overrides its own technical evidence. ""It's really important this process is seen to be evidence-based and rational,"" said Gordon Edge of Renewable UK. ""The government took technical guidance on this issue. If at this point the government says we are going to do less for onshore wind than it proposed that will be seen as nakedly political."" Mr Edge told BBC News he believed that the industry might have a case for judicial review if the cut exceeded 10%. The government has previously lost in the courts over policies on solar and nuclear. Visual impacts It is politics that is delaying the announcement of subsidies for 2013-2017. In Ayrshire, for instance, the wind energy body, Renewable UK, held an open briefing session last week about the benefits of community wind farms. The majority present appeared to favour windpower and the subsidies that underpin it, but a few were furious about the impact on the countryside. One local, Aileen Jackson, told me she was disturbed by wind from a turbine near her home: ""The subsidies need to be cut at least 50% to stop the wind farms taking over our landscape and making residents lives a misery."" That is the sort of anger which drove more than 100 backbench Tories to write to the chancellor demanding radical cuts in the subsidies to onshore wind that get paid through people's power bills. The protest was led by Chris Heaton-Harris, MP for Daventry, who told BBC News: ""I think subsidies should be drastically cut. The rumours of a 25% cut and zero subsidy by 2020 would be a good starting point."" Conservatives do not speak with one voice, though. The chair of the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee (ECCC), Tim Yeo, warned that cutting subsidies too fast would actually increase bills. ""We know there's a great political controversy surrounding onshore wind, particularly within the Conservative Party. I think some people don't appreciate that amongst the low carbon renewables, onshore wind offers better value than many alternatives. Reducing onshore wind would mean putting up bills for consumers,"" he said. Steady gains All parts of government want to see renewables stand on their own feet without subsidy - the question is how fast it can be achieved. The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) arrived at its 10% cut proposal after commissioning reports from Poyry and Arup, and hearing evidence from academics and the wind industry. Experts I have consulted broadly agree that the subsidy can be cut - but not by as much as 25%. So, how much leeway does the government have? How far can wind farms improve, and how much will costs come down? Colin Morgan from the leading technical consultancy Garrad Hassan told BBC News that the modern wind turbine was a better neighbour than its predecessor - quieter and turning slower. A modern wind farm used 2,000-3,000kW turbines compared with the 300kW turbines of 1990. Some old wind farms have recently been re-powered to achieve dramatically improved output from higher hub heights, more efficient structural design, improved layout and other turbine refinements. ""There's still steady progress being made on the technical efficiency of turbines, through incremental developments as well some new technologies coming into play - like converter technology and permanent magnet generators. ""We are probably talking about future potential for a few percent of improvement in annual energy output. To improve that dramatically would require the breaking of some laws of physics."" He said research into reducing wake losses (caused by wind turbines operating in the wake of others) might also yield significant improvements. But he warned that a cut of 25% in subsidy would risk ""bringing the industry to a grinding halt"". 'Local power' Prof David Infield from Strathclyde University told BBC News that the efficiency of wind turbines had almost doubled since early models but that technical efficiency was reaching a plateau. He said the cost of manufacturing wind farms could be expected to fall slowly as the industry expanded. But he said a 10% subsidy cut was about right for now. ""Developers are being squeezed by rising materials costs and capital costs. I don't believe that profits for developers are excessive - but investors' profits are often excessive. If the government continues to mess around with subsidy levels that will increase uncertainty and give another excuse for developers to put up the cost of capital."" Energy consultant Nigel Cornwall said the issue of subsidies was complicated, as developers received the same subsidy for a very windy site as for a less windy site. He added: ""That means the single band of support is very generous for some developers but not enough for others. ""All this talk of cutting subsidies at the last minute is political rubbish. If the government cuts too much, a lot of less well-positioned sites with lower wind speed but close to population centres won't get developed. That makes no sense. There should be a premium on local power - we shouldn't be driving all the wind power to the edges of Britain where there are poor transmission lines and no-one lives."" Rod Wood, managing director of Community Wind, which is using new efficient Siemens gearless turbines at its site in Daly, Ayrshire, told BBC News: ""We can tolerate a cut of 10% in subsidy. But 25% - forget it. It would kill the industry stone dead."" Policy targets The subsidies debate is part of a broader battle over energy policy between government and backbenchers and between DECC and the treasury. The UK is struggling to meet two legally binding environmental energy targets: to cut CO2 80% by 2050, and to get 15% of energy from renewables by 2020. Both will require investment estimated at £8bn a year by 2020. Current investment is funded by a levy on energy bills, but the levy has been capped by the chancellor to 2015 and the cap to 2020 has not been fixed, adding to the confusion amongst investors over future policy. MPs on the ECCC wanted to ask treasury ministers if the cap would over-ride the energy and CO2 targets, but ministers refused to give evidence, saying that it would be improper to comment on another department's affairs. Tim Yeo said: ""This is disingenuous. We are supposed to be conducting pre-legislative scrutiny of the bill, but we can't do that if the treasury's influence can't be scrutinised."" The Energy Secretary Ed Davey told the MPs that laws on energy and climate would be met. Next week experts at the International Energy Agency will urge governments to keep up subsidies to renewables to keep production rising and the price falling in the long term.",['Wind power firms warn they may take the government to court if they get caught in a political row over subsidies.'],"[""The government's decision to cut subsidies for onshore wind could be seen as nakedly political, according to an industry body.""]",0.2857142857142857,0.05000000000000001,0.19047619047619047,0.19047619047619047,34.67254633847837
"Former Labour parliamentary candidate Corrie Drew said he was homophobic and ""an enthusiastic supporter of Hitler"". The website Topple the Racists said he committed ""atrocities against the Zulus in his military career"". However, some historians have argued the allegations are either unfair or entirely unfounded. 'Nazi sympathies' In 2010, declassified MI5 files revealed that Baden-Powell held talks in 1937 with the head of the Hitler Youth movement and was invited to meet Adolf Hitler himself. Lord Baden-Powell's biographer Tim Jeal said any admiration for the Nazi leader was confined to their shared ideas about boys' education. The author said a diary entry in which Baden-Powell described Hitler's autobiographical manifesto Mein Kampf as a ""wonderful book"" had been misinterpreted. Mr Jeal said: ""It was all to do with the outward bound life - it was only these references to character-training that he found appealing, not Hitler's hatred of Jews. ""Baden-Powell condemned Hitler for being a megalomaniac and for mounting what he called 'huge pageants for hypnotising his people'. ""He hated totalitarianism, twice hoped that he would be able to marry Jewish women and chose a Jewish doctor."" Historian Dr Andrew Norman said the Nazis vowed to execute Baden-Powell in the event of a successful invasion of Britain. He said: ""He wanted to introduce the Scout movement into Germany to foster friendship between the two countries. ""His efforts were in vain, and for his pains he was put on a Nazi death list because the Germans suspected he was using scouts as spies."" 'War atrocities' Baden-Powell's exploits as an army officer in South Africa involved several controversial incidents. His early military career was clouded by an operation to track down Zulu rebels in 1888, which led to at least three deaths. Mr Jeal said: ""He lost control of his men who may well have committed murder. ""Even if he had given orders to spare the rebels' lives, it's incredibly unlikely that his Zulu mercenaries would have obeyed. ""A lot of trouble stemmed from this and he was lucky not to lose his career."" Baden-Powell was later accused of executing an African chief in 1897 who had been promised his safety in return for surrendering. Mr Jeal said: ""This is probably the most damaging charge made against Baden-Powell. ""White settlers were being murdered in a remote part of Matabeleland. Baden-Powell had orders to capture the chief, Uwini, thought to be responsible and suppress his rebellion. ""Because the chief was wounded during capture and Baden-Powell doubted he would survive a long journey to the Cape to face a civil court, he court-martialled him on the spot. ""The verdict was death, so he was shot. Baden-Powell had exceeded his orders."" At the turn of the century, Baden-Powell was acclaimed a hero for his defence of the South African town of Mafeking during the Second Boer War. His biographer said: ""The worst that is normally said about him is that he starved 2,000 black Africans in Mafeking and stole their food to feed the white population. ""This is an absolute lie. He opened soup kitchens and shot all of his cavalry horses so that he could feed them."" 'Romantic homosexual' Baden-Powell spoke of the dangers of being ""sentimental"" about boys. But Dr Norman said the Scouts founder was ""confused about his own sexuality"" and sometimes slept on a balcony to be away from his wife. Mr Jeal said: ""He was gay and repressed it. Men were beautiful to him but he was a romantic, not a practising, homosexual. ""If a scoutmaster was said to have either had a liaison with another master or was 'sentimental' about boys, he would remove them quietly, rather than call in the police. ""Everything he wrote about the attractiveness of men was in favour of a gay cause.""",['A council has said it may temporarily remove a statue of Robert Baden-Powell from public view after critics accused the Scout movement founder of racism.'],"['A former British army officer has said he was ""an enthusiastic supporter of Adolf Hitler"".']",0.1951219512195122,0.05128205128205128,0.1951219512195122,0.1951219512195122,18.998554960777277
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent The average fee level for 2014-15 will rise by about £150 to about £8,650. But the total amount to be spent on supporting poorer students will also rise to £708m, up from £672m. Offa director Les Ebdon said universities were spending ""increasingly smartly"". The fair access watchdog is publishing details of the fees that universities and colleges will charge in 2014-15 and how much they will spend on recruiting and retaining poorer students. Outreach work Before universities are allowed to charge fees above £6,000 per year, they have to sign an ""access agreement"" with Offa. These agreements show that 72% of universities are planning to charge the maximum £9,000 fee for some or all courses, compared with 62% the previous year. Offa's report says that 26% of this higher fee income will be spent on protecting fair access to university. This proportion of income is similar to the previous year, but the access watchdog argues that universities are becoming more effective in how they deploy their budgets for supporting poorer students. More money will be spent on outreach projects, where universities build links with schools and young people to encourage them to think about applying to university. This can include summer schools and visits to universities. ""Outreach work is key to addressing the unacceptably large participation gap that remains at the universities with the highest entry requirements, so I welcome the greater focus in this area,"" said Prof Ebdon. He said that universities were being more strategic in their spending and using ""evidence and evaluation"" to see what works in reaching ""students from under-represented backgrounds"". ""Expenditure on outreach and student support by universities in England has continued to rise and, crucially, is being invested in a focused and targeted way,"" said Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK. ""These agreements demonstrate how universities remain committed to widening access and supporting student success."" But the National Union of Students highlighted that last month's spending review marked the end of the National Scholarship Programme as funding for undergraduates. The £150m scholarship fund for poorer students is to be cut to £50m and targeted at postgraduates. ""Money worries lead many students to consider dropping out of university and even the small payments from the National Scholarship Programme could be the difference between gaining a life changing qualification and leaving with nothing,"" said NUS vice president, Rachel Wenstone. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""The government is determined to encourage anyone with the ambition and ability to go to university, irrespective of their background.

"It has acquired 187 patents and 36 applications, adding to the 1,000 it purchased from IBM last summer. The latest patents include a system for ""using semantic networks to develop a social network"". Google has spent billions building its technology rights portfolio, including a $12.5bn (£7.7bn) deal for Motorola Mobility. The California-based company has been actively bolstering its patent catalogue in the face of lawsuits from key competitors such as Apple and Microsoft. Among the patents acquired in this latest deal isUS Patent 7,865,592which relates specifically to social networking sites, allowing ""identifying common interests between users of a communication network"". Vicki Salmon, the chair of the litigation committee of the UK Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, believed this might be a nod that Google was moving from protecting existing technology and beginning to plan for the future. ""When you start you have to play catch-up,"" she told the BBC. ""When you've finished playing catch-up and you've got yourself in a stronger position, you then can begin to look forward."" Other patents included a method forusing web-based applications across additional devices, and an intriguingly titledcomputer phone. Neither Google nor IBM would comment on the deal when approached by the BBC. 'Get real' Last year, Google accused its competitors of buying up what it called ""bogus patents"" in order to slow the development of its Android operating system. However, the company now appears to have succumbed to the same approach as it adds the IBM patents to a portfolio that also includestechnology for driverless cars. ""Although you can object to a lot of cost of inconvenience by virtue of people enforcing their patents, the patent system still exists,"" Piers Strickland, a lawyer specialising in mobile telephone patent litigation, told the BBC ""In order to engage with that you've either got to take licences from from people's patents, and/or aggressively increase your bartering position by buying patents. ""I think they've realised that they just had to get real, and understand that you can't just ignore the system."" Google's agreement to buy Motorola Mobility,announced in August last year, includes 24,500 patents, many of which could be used to defend the use of features on its Android mobile operating system. The purchase is currently beingreviewed by competition regulators. 'Turf war' Google's Motorola move came off the back oflosing out on buying the 6,000-strong patent portfolioof bankrupt telecoms firm Nortel. It was outbid by a consortium of companies including Apple, Microsoft and Blackberry manufacturer Research in Motion. ""The reality is that you've got a fairly vicious turf war going on between the different operating systems,"" explained Ms Salmon. ""People want to be in there, and they want their platform established and people to be using them."" Google is just one of many technology companies involved in patent lawsuits which seek to slow down competition or strike lucrative licensing fee settlements. On Wednesday, US mobile operator AT&T was forced to pay Tivo - the digital video recorder specialist - $215m plus additional undisclosed monthly licensing fees.

"The extent of the problem was highlighted after a man's Twitter thread documenting the theft of a co-worker's shrimp fried rice was liked more than 400,000 times. Los Angeles-based Zak Toscani said his colleague was able to trace the person responsible by watching CCTV footage. The plot thickened when it was revealed a colleague had binned the fried rice. The offender was out of the office at the time of the revelation, according to Mr Toscani, but arrived back at work shortly after an email had been sent to all staff warning them not to steal lunches. After reading the email from HR, the ""thief"" expressed shock. Mr Toscani ended the thread by saying that although the staff knew who was to blame for the disappearing shrimp fried rice, they ""may never know why she did it"" - but some Twitter users had their theories. You may also like Nic Stransky assumed the colleague thought she was ""being helpful"". While James Mullarky believed the culprit may have been getting her own back on inconsiderate consumers of pungent foods. Despite the unclear motive, the tale encouraged many people to share their similar experiences of workplace food theft, and according to J-Swizzle on Twitter, an incident he witnessed led to marriage. Although Nicole File may have been frustrated at her food being eaten, she couldn't fault the thief's cleaning skills. But Heradasha's boss took office food-binning to a new level.

"Solicitors ask local authorities to carry out the searches on issues including planning and traffic. Telor Dyer, a residential conveyancer in Carmarthenshire, said waiting times in some parts of Wales had doubled to 30 working days. Pembrokeshire council said it had a backlog after the lockdown in March. The Conveyancing Association warned the backlog facing local authorities was ""becoming a significant issue"". Local authority searches show details about a property such as whether it is a listed building or in conservation area. These details can have an effect on future planning works to the property. Not a 'unique issue' Pembrokeshire council, one of the local authorities facing difficulties, said it would not be processing any new searches ""other than those deemed urgent"" due to its backlog. Issues, the council said, included the inability to access County Hall, where searches have to be checked against maps stored there, followed by the unprecedented demand in property sales since the lifting of restrictions. But a council spokesperson said this was ""not an issue unique to Pembrokeshire - many other local authorities are working to a 40-day turn around"". The spokesperson said their usual turnaround for searches was seven to 10 days, but due to the pressures on the service they have implemented an average 20-day turnaround to work through the backlog. ""The matter is being kept under constant review,"" they said. Residential conveyancer Mr Dyer, based in St Clears, said he had seen significant delays and that they were down to a property boom and staff shortages. ""Usually, we anticipate, searches would take 10 to 15 working days, but now it's taking 30 working days,"" he said. ""There's nothing we can do speed things up. We have had sellers pull out and there's nothing we can do about it."" Rebecca Goldsworthy, director and head of residential property in south east Wales for JCP Solicitors, said local searches were an important part of the buying process. ""There's nothing we can do about that other than advise our clients there is a bit of a wait. We are concerned another lockdown period will cause further delay,"" she said. ""A delay with searches will hold up the chains."" 'Relieve the pressure' Meanwhile, the Conveyancing Association has called on the government to extend the holiday on land transaction tax. The starting threshold for the tax has been increased from £180,000 to £250,000 for the main residential rates until 31 March 2021. Similar holidays have been introduced for property sales taxes in the rest of the UK. Operations director Lloyd Davies said its member firms, who undertake about 30% of all property transactions in England and Wales, were 130% to 150% over capacity at the moment. He said the holiday should be extended to at least 2022 to ""relieve the pressure"", or there would be a large number of transactions that do not meet the deadline. The Welsh Government said the temporary changes to land transaction tax were specific time-limited measures intended to support the housing market and broader economy in Wales during the remainder of this financial year but were kept under regular review.","['Some house sales are falling through because of delays to property searches during the Covid-19 pandemic, a solicitor has warned.']","['More than 40,000 property searches are being carried out in Wales due to a ""significant backlog"" of information about a property.']",0.2790697674418604,0.04878048780487805,0.1395348837209302,0.1395348837209302,28.884035194887336
"Gregory Irvin is alleged to have murdered 74-year-old Anne James during a visit to her home in Doveridge Place, Walsall, in February. Prosecutor Rachel Brand QC said blood matching that of Mrs James was found on Mr Irvin's jacket and the accelerator of his Mini after her death. Mr Irvin, 26, of Bilboe Road, Bilston, denies murder. Opening the trial at Birmingham Crown Court, Ms Brand said Mrs James's husband had been admitted to hospital with pneumonia about a week before she was killed. Mrs James had returned from a shopping trip when she was was stabbed in her chest and back and had her throat cut, jurors heard. A council CCTV camera showed Mr Irvin park his blue Mini on Sandwell Street before walking to his grandmother's house, then leaving 15 minutes later, the court was told. Ms Brand said he had made 'no comment' to police questions after his arrest. She said: ""Since then he has said to people that he had no memory of the events of the 28th February in his grandmother's house."" Ms Brand said no murder weapon has been found. She added: ""He wasn't working at the time and he certainly had a need for money as he was regularly using cocaine."" He had arranged to pay the debt off in instalments under an IVA, but it was not known if he was still gambling at the time of the offence, she told the court. Mr Irvin is also alleged to have removed a security camera and his grandmother's mobile phone from the house, and later told a police officer he had not seen her on the day she died. Jurors were told they were likely to be asked to consider a partial defence of diminished responsibility based upon the defendant's mental state, which would reduce murder to the lesser offence of manslaughter. A psychiatrist acting for the defence will argue Irvin was suffering from moderate depression and may have had an ""intense, violent, autistic meltdown"" which affected his judgment, the jury was told.

"About 20,000 spectators filled Barcelona's famous Monumental arena, where top matadors performed. Lawmakers voted for the ban last year - the first in mainland Spain - after 180,000 people signed a petition. They say the bullfighting is barbaric, but opponents say they will challenge the ban in Spain's top court. Sell-out show The ban takes effect on 1 January, but Sunday's fights in Catalonia were the last events of the 2011 season. Spain's top three matadors performed at the arena on Sunday, including legendary Jose Tomas. They killed six half-tonne bulls to loud shouts of ""Ole!"" of the fans. After the last animal was killed, the crowd carried the three matadors on their shoulders out of the arena to the applause of onlookers. ""For a city like Barcelona to close this arena is like throwing a Picasso painting into the garbage,"" Cristobal, one of the fans at the Monumental, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Tickets for the historic bullfights in Barcelona sold out at record speed. They were trading on the black market for up to five times their original value, the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Spain reports. Many corrida (bullfighting) fans protested outside the arena, carrying posters which read ""RIP"" in blood-red letters and blowing whistles. But such large crowds have been rare at the Barcelona bullring for some time, and this dwindling support is one reason the regional parliament voted in favour of banning the corrida, our correspondent adds. She adds that there is also a growing awareness of animal rights and, crucially, the desire of Catalan nationalists to distinguish the region from the rest of Spain and its traditions. Bullfighting is permitted in all other regions of Spain except in the Canary Islands, which banned it in 1991. Campaigners hope to extend the ban across the country, but they face a far tougher task in traditional bullfighting heartlands like Andalucia and Madrid, our correspondent says. She says many people there dismiss all talk of cruelty and argue that the corrida is an age-old art form that must be protected and preserved.","[""Bullfighting fans in Catalonia have seen the last fights before a ban on the age-old tradition comes into effect in Spain's north-eastern region.""]","[""Catalonia's ban on bullfighting in the country has come into force.""]",0.42105263157894735,0.05555555555555555,0.2631578947368421,0.2631578947368421,25.254145363418733
"By Hannah MooreNewsbeat reporter Around a third of the UK's small gig spaces have closed in the past decade, according to Music Venue Trust. ""These venues are run by passionate people who really want live music to happen in their local town or city, they're not profit making"" says CEO Mark Davyd. The charity's Fightback 2017 campaign will raise money to help venue owners. The Cellar in Oxford is one of the latest at risk of being shut down, because the landlords want to redevelop it. ""There aren't that many places for up-and-coming artists to try out their material and create a fan base,"" says Tim Hopkins, who runs the 150-person capacity space. ""This is a stepping stone venue. Without this, you can't go on to play places like the Royal Albert Hall or the big O2 arenas. You need to get it right down here."" Foals, Rob Da Bank and Glass Animals are among more than 12,000 people who've signed a petition against The Cellar's closure. ""My love for clubbing and nightlife basically came from The Cellar,"" says Glass Animals' lead singer Dave Bayley. ""It was one of those places you'd go to even if you don't know the band or the DJ, just cos it's always an amazing vibe,"" he tells Newsbeat. The venue is owned by a charity, which says it can raise more money for good causes by converting it into a shop. According to the Music Venue Trust, the number of small music venues in the UK has fallen from around 700 to 450 in the past decade. ""Planners and developers view grassroots music venues as an easy target,"" says Mark. ""They're not run by people who are desperately trying to make money, and they don't have the funding to get the legal teams to demand the rights they have in law."" Boardwalk in Sheffield and The Cockpit in Liverpool are some of the recent casualties and The Sound Lounge in Tooting is also at risk. The Music Venue Trust claims to have helped save 40 UK music venues in the past year through its Emergency Response Team, which helps with things like legal fees. There are several reasons why venues get threatened with closure, including rent increases and noise complaints. Some are simply old fashioned, and the owners don't have the money to modernise them, says Mark. ""They are now lagging behind in technology, the sound, the lighting. We want to improve 100 grassroots music venues in the next five years.""

"Cornwall Council plans to provide low-interest finance for owners who cannot raise money through conventional lenders for renovations. The council says there are more than 3,500 uninhabitable properties in the county. It is holding an open day on Friday in St Austell to provide more information about the Empty Property Loan Scheme. 'Difficult to mortgage' In July the council revealed some privately-owned houses had been empty for more than 20 years. Cabinet member for housing and planning Mark Kaczmarek said: ""The issue of empty properties is the subject of increased national and local awareness and action. ""Many empty properties are likely to be difficult to mortgage through conventional lenders and it is the council's aim to provide financial assistance in those circumstances through its new Empty Property Loan Scheme."" The scheme offers up to £20,000 of finance for necessary repairs and renovation to bring a property up to a respectable standard. The council said the loan would be repaid on the sale of the house.

"By Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, BBC News At this week's summit in Newport in Wales, Nato heads of state will agree on a Readiness Action Plan to respond to such crises. It will involve setting up a new spearhead force of 4-5,000 troops, ready to deploy within 48 hours. The alliance is also committed to boosting its intelligence gathering and sharing with the use of spy planes and unmanned drones. Swarm of drones Earlier this year, a US Military Global Hawk entered British airspace en route to Norway. It was the first time the highly secretive unmanned surveillance plane had flown over Britain. Few, if any, would have caught a glimpse of it at 15,240m (50,000 ft), well above the cruising altitude of passenger planes. Nor did many know what it was up to. The Global Hawk, whose powerful sensors can monitor every single traffic movement in the state of Florida while flying 100 miles (60 km) off the coast, was joining a swarm of other drones, as well as manned spy planes of all shapes and sizes, in the largest ever test of Nato's ability to gather and share intelligence. On the ground Nato troops were launching hand-held mini-drones, like the Raven, to give them live pictures of the land ahead. The trial, called Unified Vision, involved the use of four military satellites, 24 surveillance aircraft, 15 ground-based vehicles with sensors and radars, as well as two warships. US Global Hawks have already been used over Iraq to locate Islamic State fighters and their positions. They have also been flown over Nigeria to try to locate hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram. By the end of the decade, Nato too will have acquired five of the high-altitude unmanned spy planes at a cost of $1.7bn (£1bn). They will be operated out of Sigonella airbase in Sicily and will help the alliance build up what it describes as its ""situational awareness"" in times of crises. It is just what Nato needs to develop a clear picture of the build-up of Russian forces on the border with Ukraine. Revolution in warfare? That is the kit, but the location for Unified Vision is close to nirvana for the international military alliance too. Situated in a remote Norwegian fjord with large stretches of uninhabited land, wide empty stretches of water and uncluttered airspace, it is the perfect place to put the technology through its paces. Its relative isolation also allows military planners to block GPS signals or launch cyber attacks to simulate the challenges of electronic warfare. Unlike most military exercises, the majority of the 2,000 military personnel involved in Unified Vision were staring at computer screens and live video feeds rather than through the sight of a rifle. ""Computers and computer technology are becoming part of the fabric of warfare,"" says Dr Richard Wittstruck, who leads Nato's Joint Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance group. ""As we look at a digital age, the soldier treats the computer as part of his weapon cache. It's as important as a tank or a rifle or any other weapon,"" he adds. Ludwig Decamps, the alliance's director of aerospace capabilities describes all this reliance on technology as ""an evolution in warfare"". It looks and feels more like a revolution. More than bombs The challenge for Nato, and the purpose of Unified Vision, is to make sure allies can use all the technology at their disposal and then share the intelligence gathered. It is no easy task. First the nations that make up Nato use different systems, from aircraft to software. Second, not everyone wants to share all the intelligence they collect. In Afghanistan it took Nato the best part of a decade to put systems in place that would allow all those countries involved to share intelligence. Lieutenant Colonel Matt Martin, the joint commander for Unified Vision, says it is vital to prepare for future operations. ""When a Nato campaign kicks off, you don't know who will show up and what they will bring,"" he says. This training is vital for ensuring there is a common set of procedures and systems in place under which they can all work and function together when the next crises arises. To do that, they rehearse a number of ""vignettes"", ranging from a humanitarian crisis and fleeing refugees to dealing with an insurgency, and even a full conflict. In one scenario, a French military analyst interprets the data coming in from a Czech listening station that has been trying to identify the location of a surface-to-air missile battery. The French analyst then passes on the intelligence to an Italian air commander who orders Norwegian F-16 to destroy the target. All this information is relayed to a nerve centre, or ""intelligence fusion cell"", where civilian and military intelligence personnel sift through the data and watch the live feeds from drones flying above. It has the potential to be a Tower of Babel; English is not the only language being spoken. Different software and systems have the potential to add to the confusion. Then there is the task of storing all this information on servers which can be accessed by the different nations taking part. This trial in Norway tried to iron out some of those challenges. It is also a reminder that the future of warfare is much more than just bombs and bullets.","[""The crisis in Ukraine has refocused minds at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato) on the threat posed by Russia and the need to improve the alliance's collective defence capability.""]","['In the run-up to the Nato summit in Wales, the US military has been testing a new way of sharing intelligence.']",0.2641509433962264,0.0,0.1509433962264151,0.1509433962264151,15.503923559365065

"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent The arrow-shaped racer clocked a speed of 461mph (741km/h) as it powered across a dried-out lakebed in southern Africa's Kalahari desert on Friday. This mark tops the 403mph (648km/h) recorded by Donald Campbell in his Bluebird CN7 car in 1964. The only British cars to have gone faster are Thrust2 and Thrust SSC which both got well above 600mph (965km/h). Thrust SSC still holds the absolute land speed record of 763mph (1,228km/h) set in 1997. The driver on that occasion was RAF pilot Andy Green. The Wing Commander is at the controls again in Bloodhound. His new car's mark can only be unofficial because it wasn't running under proper land speed record rules. These require a car to make two runs through a measured mile inside an hour. The recognised speed is then the average of the two passes. The racing must be overseen by world motorsport's governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Nonetheless, Bloodhound is starting to demonstrate its potential as it sets its sights on bettering Thrust SSC's supersonic achievements. The Bloodhound car is conducting what are described as high-speed trials on Hakskeen Pan. Engineers are working through a series of tests to verify the vehicle's design and the proper working of its subsystems. With a Eurofighter jet engine onboard, it ought to be capable of reaching 500-600mph (800-965km/h) this year. The addition of a rocket motor in 2020 might then see Bloodhound thunder past 800mph (1,290km/h). Friday's outing was the car's fifth run across the desert, intended to examine its stability and brake chute performance. A further Friday run was abandoned when the crosswinds started to gust beyond acceptable limits. Donald Campbell's speed of 403mph was set on Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre, the huge salt pan in central Australia. It was the last official mark to hold the land speed record with a wheel-driven vehicle. All subsequent records have been set by jet or rocket-powered cars. Bloodhound is using a Rolls-Royce EJ200 turbofan to get itself rolling and to accelerate through the lower hundreds mph. A monopropellant rocket from the Norwegian Nammo company, when it's hung below the jet next year, should enable Bloodhound to punch through the sound barrier and attack Thrust SSC's world record. The Bloodhound project is led from the UK but is being hosted by the Northern Cape government. Local people have cleared Hakskeen Pan of stones. The hope is this flat lakebed can become a draw for other racers in the future.",['The Bloodhound vehicle has become the third fastest British car of all time - unofficially.'],['The British Wing Commander Bloodhound has become the first jet-powered car to break the world land speed record.'],0.4242424242424242,0.12903225806451615,0.36363636363636365,0.36363636363636365,37.58323323099392

Mark Wilson, a British expat who runs two pubs on the island, also tried to help the community. His pub, the Cat and Fiddle, was the centre of relief operations for worried Britons looking for information about relatives or friends who may have been killed or injured in the blasts. ""The Balinese really came together that day and in the months after to help those who had been affected by the blasts,"" he said in his pub. ""They became very introspective, trying to figure out how this could happen on their peaceful island. And the economy here really suffered. ""People stopped coming here and all the young men and women who worked in the pubs and bars couldn't send money home to their families in the villages."" But Mr Wilson says that Bali has learned a great deal from that tragedy and is now much safer than before. ""These sorts of things could happen anywhere in the world now,"" he said. ""And Bali is no different. But what I know is that it is much more prepared and far more aware than before."" Terror arrests The Bali attacks thrust Indonesia into the middle of the global war on terror. Over the last decade Indonesian anti-terror forces have worked hard to combat home-grown militant networks, and by and large their efforts have been deemed successful. The shadowy extremist group Jemaah Islamiah has been mostly dismantled, with many of the top leaders either captured or killed. Abu Bakar Bashir, the man thought to be the spiritual leader of the group, is behind bars serving out a prison sentence on terror-related charges. But officials say Indonesia cannot afford to be complacent. Over the last few months there have been a string of terror-related arrests. Indonesia's top anti-terror boss says this shows there are still militants out there. ""They are still active, recruiting young militants and active in fund-raising and financing attacks. They are also active in making bombs,"" said Ansyaad Mbai. 'Closer to home' But over the years, their targets have changed. ""If we compare with the past, the targets of the extremists were foreigners, the West,"" said Mr Mbai. ""Today it is closer to home - the Indonesian police and authorities. We are their enemies now."" Bali police have this week raised fears that militants are planning another attack to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of the attacks. They say they have received credible information that dignitaries attending the memorial ceremonies are possible targets. But those fears have not dampened spirits on Bali's beaches. At Kuta Beach, just a short hop on a motorbike from the memorial honouring those who died in Bali, the tourists are back - blaring out hip-hop tunes from their boom boxes and covering the beach with their bronzed bodies. Tourist arrivals for Australians - the country worst hit by the blasts - are now at a record high. There are more visitors to this island than before the blasts. Many here hope that 10 years on, Bali can finally close the chapter on its deadly tragedy.","[""Ten years ago, two deadly bombs ripped through two nightclubs on the Indonesian island of Bali and killed 202 people - mostly foreigners on holiday.

"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter ""If anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war,"" he told the audience. His prescient words picked up some coverage at the time, including from the BBC - but largely went unheeded. But now, the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times - with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself. Some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites. Others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world. Still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory, or even attempting to implant microchips into people. The face of public health ""There are myriad conspiracies surrounding Bill Gates,"" said Rory Smith, from fact-checkers First Draft News. ""He is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies. And it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll - because he has always been the face of public health."" Theories falsely linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April, according to a study by The New York Times and Zignal Labs. Much of the content is posted to public Facebook groups, from where it is shared millions of times. First Draft News has also found that Chinese viral video site TikTok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones. Rich and famous So how did the founder of Microsoft, who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife Melinda, become the bogeyman of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists? Prof Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and author of books on conspiracy theories, believes it is simply because he is rich and famous. ""Conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things,"" he told the BBC. ""The theories are basically the same, just the names change. ""Before Bill Gates, it was George Soros and the Koch brothers and the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers."" And while the majority of conspiracy theories ""die on the vine"", the ones that endure are those that offer ""big villains and address issues that people care about"". ""It should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear,"" he said. ""This has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long, long time."" While he thinks such conspiracies have ""no tether to the truth whatsoever"", people still seem to be falling for them. More than a quarter of all Americans and 44% of Republicans believe that Bill Gates wants to use a Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin, according to a survey from Yahoo News and YouGov. Mr Smith thinks that there is often a ""kernel of truth"" which is taken ""way out of context"". So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye. It would be invisible to the naked eye, and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine. It is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories - but it's thought the internet is making them spread further. ""Before the internet, they were self-contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities, but the internet allows them to travel across political lines, between communities, so I think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet,"" said Mr Smith. And, he added, conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were ""psychologically vulnerable"". ""This crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published. There are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty,"" he said. To deal with it, individuals resort to something he calls collective sense-making. ""We grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts. Conspiracy theories - and notably Bill Gates conspiracy theories - fill these informational vacuums."" 'Have to laugh' The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $300m (£240m) to combat Covid-19, has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims. In a statement to the BBC it said: ""We're concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health. ""At a time like this, when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it's distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. Right now, one the best things we can do to stop the spread of Covid-19 is spread the facts."" In an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories. ""It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people."" I'm kind of surprised some of it is focused on me. We are just giving money away, we write the cheque.. and yes we do think about let's protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff. You almost have to laugh sometimes.""","['In 2015, an unassuming-looking Bill Gates came on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver to issue a dire warning.']",['Bill Gates has given a talk on Covid-19 at the BBC.'],0.36363636363636365,0.12903225806451613,0.30303030303030304,0.30303030303030304,15.9407784535781
"It was announced last year the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be leaving Kensington Palace. Their new home - Frogmore Cottage - sits in the grounds of Frogmore House, where they held their wedding reception in May 2018. Extensive renovations were carried out at the property in preparation for the move. When their new official residence was announced in November, Kensington Palace said: ""Windsor is a very special place for their Royal Highnesses and they are grateful that their official residence will be on the estate."" Furnishing bill The estimated cost to the taxpayer of the renovations is £3 million. The duke and duchess, who will foot the bill for furnishings, are said to have hired former Soho House interior designer Vicky Charles to transform their new home. Frogmore Cottage is about half a mile south of Windsor Castle and Frogmore House is also where Harry and Meghan posed for their official engagement photos. It has been a royal residence since 1792 and was built in about 1680 by Charles II's architect. In 1923, the Queen's parents - the future George VI and Queen Elizabeth - spent part of their honeymoon there. The name Frogmore is derived from the frogs which have always lived in the low-lying marshy area. The couple had been living at Nottingham Cottage at Kensington Palace since getting engaged. The move comes after the couple split their household office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

"Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl now faces the possibility of life imprisonment. Who is Bowe Bergdahl? Sgt Bergdahl was released in March 2015, five years after being captured by Afghan Taliban, in a controversial exchange for five Taliban officials being held at Guantanamo Bay. The prisoner swap came after secret talks between the US government and the Taliban, brokered by Qatar. Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan. The circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign. In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. The US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban. Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl What do we know about his disappearance? The circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official at the time. Several commentators and soldiers branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished. The Idaho native's lawyers have argued he cannot get a fair trial following criticism from Donald Trump during last year's presidential campaign. Mr Trump had called him ""a no-good traitor who should have been executed"". ""We may as well go back to kangaroo courts and lynch mobs,"" Sgt Bergdahl said in a 2016 interview that was obtained by ABC News and broadcast recently. The New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 that he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time. US officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military. The US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the soldier, now aged 31, was innocent until proven guilty. ""When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened."" The defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry. How was he handed over? Taliban officials say the soldier was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground. The exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter. Once the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters ""SF?"" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: ""Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time."" Taliban release video of handover Why was he released? Sgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the ""Standing with Bowe"" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho. Negotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began in 2012 with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar. But the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC. Direct negotiations broke down in 2014 when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar. The issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap. Who are the Guantanamo detainees? The exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari. They were thought in 2015 to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001. Fazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims. Khairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden. Some argued at the time that there was a US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran. Was there a political row over his release? Some US lawmakers complained at the time that the swap breached a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House said it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in ""unique and exigent circumstances"". The US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives. Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC in 2015 that the swaps ""threatened"" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers called for an inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process. But President Obama remained publicly unapologetic for the swap. No Obama apology for Bergdahl deal Did the releases help the wider peace process? No. There has been no diminution of the level of violence in Afghanistan, with President Trump recently deploying 3,000 more troops there.",['A US soldier captured by the Taliban for five years has pleaded guilty at a military court in North Carolina to desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.'],"['US soldiers accused of desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy have been released from Guantanamo Bay, the US military says.']",0.3829787234042553,0.2222222222222222,0.29787234042553196,0.29787234042553196,46.44418380829877

""We get visitors coming here all the time who have been here maybe 15 or 20 years ago, and they can't believe the change in both Belfast and Derry, and here we have a situation where a tiny number of people who are totally disconnected from local communities think they have the right to engage in these sorts of anti-people activities.

"His imprisonment bars him from taking part in the planned rally on 1 March. Navalny was given a suspended sentence for defrauding two firms in December.

"Westfield canal bridge near Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, was saved in 1969 by a woman who stood on it for a day to prevent workmen from blowing it up. A scheme to restore the Stroudwater Canal includes plans to reinstate the waterway beneath it. A £15m bid for Heritage Lottery cash for the project has begun. The Cotswold Canals Partnership is behind the bid, which would allow a section of the canal to be restored through to Saul Junction by 2020, at a total cost of £20m. Work will include burrowing beneath the Bristol to Birmingham railway line and ducking below the M5 with a new cutting being created alongside the River Frome. Westfield canal bridge still exists but now stands alone in the middle of a field. It was saved from demolition by local woman Christine Hearsey, who made local history by defying contractors who had been ordered to blow it up it to make way for a link road to the new motorway. As a result of her actions the road was built nearby instead. A six-week public consultation has begun and the final application for funding will be submitted in November. The scheme is part of the ongoing project to restore the seven mile-long (12 km) Stroudwater Navigation and the 29 mile-long (46km) Thames and Severn Canal.

"By Azzam AmeenBBC Sinhala, Colombo In a BBC interview, President Maithripala Sirisena said the country did not need to ""import"" specialists. Both the army and the Tamil Tiger rebels are accused of atrocities in the civil war that ended in 2009. The government previously backed a UN resolution calling for a war crimes court supported by foreign judges. But on Thursday the president said: ""I will never agree to international involvement in this matter."" ""We have more than enough specialists, experts and knowledgeable people in our country to solve our internal issues,"" he said. Read more: Main war crimes allegations ""This investigation should be internal and indigenous, without violating the laws of the country, and I believe in the judicial system and other relevant authorities in this regard. ""The international community need not worry about matters of state interest."" Asked when the court might be set up, he said: ""These things cannot be done instantly or in a hurried manner. ""We will certainly reach our target but it's a process."" In October 2015, Sri Lanka co-sponsored a UN Human Rights Council resolution calling for a special judicial mechanism to prosecute war crimes to be established - with support from Commonwealth and foreign judges, prosecutors and investigators. As many as 100,000 people are thought to have died in the Sri Lankan civil conflict. The final months of the 26-year war were the most bloody, with the government accused of repeatedly shelling safe zones set up to protect civilians. The Tamil Tiger rebels were accused of holding civilians as human shields and firing on those who tried to flee. Both sides denied the allegations. President Sirisena said that while the UN report released in September 2015 had pointed to army involvement in war crimes, the report had failed to mention names. He said it was important to determine whether such crimes actually took place. He said: ""If the Sri Lankan Army is alleged for such crimes, our concern should be to free them from those allegations. If anyone has committed a crime, there's no doubt that they should be punished. However it is wrong to make the entire army guilty for what happened."" The president also dismissed reports from the advocacy group Freedom from Torture that people in detention were still being tortured. Saying the claims were made by people who were close to the Tamil Tigers, President Sirisena added: ""I totally deny that. If some one can prove with evidence, I am ready to give them the opportunity. Justice is served equally in this country.""",['The president of Sri Lanka has said foreign judges and prosecutors should not be involved in an investigation into allegations of war crimes.'],['The Sri Lankan government has called for an independent investigation into allegations of war crimes by the army and the Tamil Tiger rebels.'],0.4782608695652174,0.22727272727272727,0.43478260869565216,0.43478260869565216,48.20315682683419
"By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website They said the ""disheartening"" results suggested the problem could snowball to affect future careers. The study on 400 children, in the journal Science, initially found both five-year-old boys and girls thought their own gender was ""brilliant"". But then only one year later, gender differences had emerged. Girl Power: How can books empower young girls? The team from Princeton University, New York University and the University of Illinois said it appeared stereotypes were starting to show. Suspected influences include exposure to media, teachers, parents and other children. The study put sets of five, six and seven-year-olds through different experiments. In one, the children were read a story about someone who is ""really, really smart"" but it is not clear who the story is about. They then had to guess the protagonist from four pictures - two of men and two of women. At age five, boys pick men and girls pick women around 75% of the time. But fast-forward a year to age six and boys are still picking men while girls are now slightly more likely to pick men too. In another scenario, groups of children played a new board game. But for some it was branded as ""for children who are really, really smart"" and for others it was described as ""for children who try really, really hard"". Six and seven-year old girls were as likely as boys to enjoy the game for those who try, but much less likely to say they enjoy the game for smart children. Prof Andrei Cimpian, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""The message that comes out of these data is that young kids are exposed to the cultural notion that genius is more likely a male than a female quality. ""It's disheartening to see these effects emerge so early. When you see them, you realise how much of an uphill battle it's going to be."" His research has previously looked at academic careers associated with needing innate brilliance in order to succeed. It argued that the higher people rated the need for genius - such as in physics or philosophy - the lower the number of women involved. Prof Cimpian added: ""Early on, society's stereotypes can create differences in trajectory. ""At five, six or seven you're not thinking about a career, but soon you're making decisions about what courses to take and what extracurriculars to take part in. ""Even if the difference starts small it can snowball into something a lot bigger."" Fellow researcher Dr Lin Bian advised parents and teachers to emphasise the importance of hard work. She told the BBC: ""[Studies suggest] that everyone does better when hard work is believed as the key to success. ""In our studies, girls might be particularly impacted by the messages focusing on 'hard work' - they became equally interested in playing the game as boys. ""Thus conveying the importance of hard work to success could protect and even promote young girls' interests."" The UK's Fawcett Society campaigns on the gender pay gap and argues early differences - blue and superheroes versus pink and princesses - is part of the problem. Sam Smethers, the organisation's chief executive, said: ""This is a massive issue and it is holding us all, but particularly girls, back.

"Energy secretary Greg Clark told MPs on Monday that public money could also be invested into Wylfa Newydd. The proposal has been on the horizon for a number of years, but ministers say the latest development is a major step forward. It is hoped work on the new plant could begin by 2020. The original Wylfa plant on Anglesey closed in 2015 after more than 40 years of service. It is hoped its £12bn replacement would have a 60-year operational life and would be run by Horizon Nuclear power - a subsidiary of Japanese giant Hitachi. Developers say the plant would create up to 8,500 jobs during the construction phase. The proposals feature a plant with a capacity of generating 2,700 megawatts of electricity, enough power for about five million homes. Mr Clark told the House of Commons that any direct investment in the project would be made alongside the Japanese government and Horizon. He said: ""This is an important next step for the project, although no decision has been taken yet to proceed with the project, and successful conclusion of these negotiations will be subject to full government, regulatory and other approvals, including but not limited to value for money, due diligence and state aid requirements. ""It remains the government's objective in the longer term that new nuclear projects - like other energy infrastructure - should be financed by the private sector."" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns welcomed the news and said the scheme would be the ""biggest infrastructure project in Wales for a generation"". The Nuclear Industry Association's chief executive heralded the announcement as ""good news"" for the UK meeting its decarbonisation targets. First minister Carwyn Jones said Mr Clark's statement was a ""significant milestone"" for the project. However, he said it was vital his government had ""a seat at the table as the project progresses to the next stage"". Analysis: Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent Successive UK governments have long seen nuclear energy as an essential part of ensuring the lights stay on in future. As we've seen with Wylfa Newydd and the new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset, it's an expensive commitment for companies to take on. With the prospect of taxpayers taking a stake to the tune of billions of pounds, the UK government's shown that it's willing share a large part of that burden in the interests of energy security. As well as the thousands of construction jobs, almost 900 people will be employed at the site when it begins operation and it could be worth £5.7bn to the Welsh economy, according to independent research. If it does go ahead, the long-term impact on north Wales will depend on making sure people have the right skills to get the jobs available and businesses benefit from contracts as suppliers. Critics will continue to be concerned about safety and the impact on the local community, not least on tourism. Environmental campaigners have also raised questions and concerns about the proposed plant. Kate Blagojevic, head of energy at Greenpeace UK, said: ""The notion that new nuclear will be good value for money is farcical when it's so much more expensive than cleaner, safer renewable alternatives that are faster to build."" Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said: ""Taking a stake in this nuclear monstrosity would see taxpayers locked into the project, and paying out for a form of electricity generation that's not fit for the future."" Ahead of the UK government's announcement, there was speculation that it would no longer support plans for a tidal lagoon in Swansea - but no announcement was made by Mr Clark. Mr Clark also did not comment on speculation that a guaranteed price for the electricity generated at Wylfa Newydd would be around £15 per megawatt hour less than the £92.50 so-called ""strike price"" awarded to EDF for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station being built in Somerset. Horizon Nuclear power still also needs to gain a development consent order as well as have all of its investment in place before construction can start.",['The UK government says it has started negotiations with a Japanese firm over a new nuclear power station on Anglesey.'],"['A £12bn nuclear power project in Wales could be financed by the private sector, the energy secretary has said.']",0.25641025641025644,0.05405405405405406,0.15384615384615385,0.15384615384615385,25.440647354714258

"Welsh ministers are awaiting a report into criteria deciding who is eligible for operations which could mean surgery is available for the less obese. The review is also considering the cost to the NHS of changing guidelines. One surgeon said Wales should eventually lower the threshold at which people qualify for NHS-funded surgery, as recommended by a health watchdog. In Wales the threshold is set for patients with a BMI, or body mass index, of 50. Patients must also have either severe and uncontrolled high blood pressure, sleep apnoea or diabetes. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) says the NHS in Wales and England and Wales should offer so-called bariatric surgery, such as gastric sleeves and bypasses, to people with a BMI of 40. It also recommends surgery for people with a BMI of 35 if they have other health problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure. An independent committee that plans specialist treatments for the NHS in Wales is reviewing the policy. The Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee is expected to deliver its findings to Health Minister Lesley Griffiths by the end of the month. Calculate your BMI Clinical assessments of who is suitable for surgery are made by a multi-disciplinary panel based at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Jonathan Barry, a consultant surgeon at the Welsh Institute of Metabolic and Obesity Surgery at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, said the Nice guidelines were the ""gold standard"" and adopting them too quickly could ""open up the floodgates"". ""In our first year/15 months of activity we had 1,000 referrals from all over Wales, of which we were eligible to operate on 67,"" he said. ""A staggering proportion of those patients are Nice compliant."" He said procedures such as gastric sleeves can pay for themselves within two-and-a-half years by allowing patients to come off other forms of medication. He added: ""What we should be doing is aggressively going after the younger, not as obese [with] early on-set diabetes. ""At the moment all we are doing is operating on people for whom the benefit is not as great."" Last year 57% of adults in Wales were classified as overweight or obese and 22% were obese. BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in metres squared: for example, 80 kg divided by (1.75m x 1.75m). A BMI of less than 18.5 is underweight, 18.5-25 is ideal, 25-30 is overweight, and 30 or above is obese. Interpretation of the figures varies for people depending on ethnic origin, if they are going through puberty, or if they are particularly muscular. In a written statement, Mrs Griffiths said the trend and prevalence of people with ""excess weight are still unacceptably high"". ""We need to keep the momentum going to prevent adults and children facing deteriorating health and a lower quality of life and we are facing spiralling health and social care costs,"" she said The review is assessing the health outcomes and costs to NHS Wales of adopting the Nice guidance. It applies to people who have failed to lose weight while getting medical help. Mrs Griffiths said the Welsh criteria were designed to focus ""scarce resources"" on the people most at risk. She said only a small proportion of patients referred for treatment go through with the surgery. About 40% drop out when the complications are explained to them. Mrs Griffiths said she would make another statement in January after receiving the review.",['A review is examining if weight loss surgery should be offered to greater numbers of obese people in Wales.'],"['People with a body mass index (BMI) should be treated at the NHS in Wales, according to a review.']",0.42105263157894735,0.16666666666666666,0.2631578947368421,0.2631578947368421,28.429892031763387

"The protest on 9 February was over the 2013 hanging of Kashmiri man Mohammed Afzal Guru and allegedly saw the chanting of anti-India slogans. Police arrested JNU student union head Kanhaiya Kumar on sedition charges but also named five other organisers. The arrest led to protests and clashes in Delhi and universities across India. Government ministers have refused to back down and vowed to punish what they describe as ""anti-national elements"", but critics condemned the charges as an assault on freedom of expression. The five students - named as Umar Khalid, Anirban Bhattacharya, Ashutosh Kumar, Anant Prakash Narayan, Riyazul Haq and Rama Naga - went missing after they were named by police. They returned to campus late on Sunday night and addressed other students holding a vigil, reports said. A section of the media had accused Umar Khalid of having links with the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, although the government later denied the reports. ""...I'm not a terrorist. I have never projected myself as a Muslim while doing politics on campus. I always tried to see exploitation of Muslims along with the exploitation faced by Dalits, tribals and others,"" Mr Khalid told a gathering. After news of the students return, police turned up at the JNU campus, Press Trust of India said, but reports say they need permission from university authorities to enter and arrest the students. At one of Mr Kumar's court appearances, he was set upon by a group of lawyers, an act which further inflamed public opinion. The protests triggered by the arrest and treatment of Mr Kumar spread far and wide with students from the southern city of Chennai (Madras) and in the eastern city of Kolkata (Calcutta) involved in violent clashes. Afzal Guru was executed over a 2001 plot to attack India's parliament - charges he always denied. The attack was carried out by Kashmiri militants and left 14 people dead. His 2013 hanging sparked protests in Kashmir, and he was seen as a martyr and a symbol of perceived injustice. But many of India's politicians were angered when reports surfaced of anti- India slogans chanted at the protest held to mark his execution.

"Those that buy euros at the airport can expect to receive around 98 euro cents for their pound. Better rates can be found by buying in advance, with the Post Office offering €1.0819. But that's still a long way from the summer of 2015, when tourists were getting at least €1.32 for their pound. The big fall came in 2016 after the UK voted to leave the European Union. Tourist rates are based on trading levels on the international currency markets. On those markets the pound earlier hit $1.2382, the lowest level against the dollar in 27 months. That fall was attributed to rising fears that the UK will leave the European Union without a withdrawal agreement. The pound also fell against the euro, hitting €1.1062, its lowest level for the year. ""It will be a big shock for tourists to Europe if they are expecting to get good value this year,"" said James Hickman, the chief commercial officer of travel money firm FairFX. He does not expect any recovery in the pound until the Brexit situation is resolved. ""All pointers are that we're in for a rocky road,"" he says. ""If people are waiting to buy at a better rate I don't think that's going to happen."" If there is a no-deal Brexit then he thinks the pound could go lower. He points out that some in the financial markets think it could hit parity against the dollar, meaning tourists would receive just $1 for each pound they exchange. At the moment the tourist rate for the pound against the dollar is $1.2127. That's down 5% on this time last year, according to the Post Office. Getting the best from your travel money Analysis by Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Millions of us would have spent many hours hunched over a computer trying to find the perfect accommodation and flights for a summer getaway, Currency experts say holidaymakers should put the same amount of effort into organising holiday money. That certainly means never waiting until you reach the airport to exchange money, as bureaux in the airport complex usually have the worst rates. Timing can be tricky - it is difficult to predict how the value of the pound will move, so one common suggestion is to change half of your holiday money weeks in advance of departure, and the rest just before, to hedge your bets. Ordering currency online in advance and then collecting the cash in person can also secure a better rate. Cash exchange is not the only option. Carrying a wad of notes can be dangerous and not always covered by travel insurance. The market for specialist pre-loaded currency cards is growing, and banks are competing on the rates and deals for overseas use that they offer to current account holders. So doing your homework on charges and shopping around is advisable. In general, using your regular debit card can be expensive, owing to the extra charges, and remember to let your bank know if you are going away to avoid being locked out by anti-fraud processes. If you do use a card on your holiday, shops, restaurants and cash machines will usually ask if you want to pay in pounds rather than the local currency. Always choose the latter. Tourists can lose up to 10% by paying in sterling rather than the domestic currency. However, if you haven't already booked your trip, then there are destinations where your pound will go further. The Post Office says it has seen a surge in sales of Turkish lira, which has been hit by political turmoil. Compared to last summer, the pound is up around 14% against the lira. Iceland is also better value than last year, the pound is up 12% against the Icelandic krona. The pound is also a little higher against the South African rand. The weak pound can also be more than compensated for by falls in local prices, the Post Office says. It tracks the prices of a range of items in European family destinations, including meals and drinks. It found that prices had fallen in half of the 15 locations, including the Algarve in Portugal. ""Picking a destination where prices on the ground are low can outweigh the impact of a weak exchange rate, but a destination where prices and cheap and sterling is strong is the best bet,"" said Nick Boden, head of Post Office Travel Money.","['Tourists could face a ""shock"" this summer when they travel abroad according to foreign currency experts.']","['The pound has hit its lowest level against the dollar in over a year, according to the Post Office.']",0.17142857142857143,0.0606060606060606,0.17142857142857143,0.17142857142857143,25.10009101022714
"Two men, who stole jewellery including Jessica's engagement ring, may have pumped gas through the air conditioning before Monday's break-in, he said. The spokesman said they were unharmed but ""unsurprisingly shaken"". But medical experts said they were sceptical that burglars had used gas in the raid on the villa in Saint Tropez. The Sun newspaper reported that valuables worth £300,000 were stolen. The couple, who married in December, were staying with friends in a rented villa at the time of the burglary. Button's spokesman said: ""Two men broke into the property whilst they all slept and stole a number of items of jewellery including, most upsettingly, Jessica's engagement ring. ""The police have indicated that this has become a growing problem in the region with perpetrators going so far as to gas their proposed victims through the air conditioning units before breaking in."" Philippe Guemas, deputy prosecutor in Draguignan, France, told Europe1 radio that ""nothing has been established"" and said the claim that gas was used in the raid was made by Button's entourage as the driver felt unwell the following day. ""To our knowledge there has never been a burglary like this in St Tropez where gas was used to knock out the victims,"" he said. ""We have taken blood samples, which will be analysed."" An operations director for SRX, a home security firm based near Mr Button's home, said the possibility of burglars using gas did not surprise him ""at all"" and he had received requests to install measures to prevent such attacks. But the Royal College of Anaesthetists said although it could not rule out that ""some sort of agent"" had been used, it was ""highly unlikely"" the group had been rendered unconscious by anaesthetic gas. This, a spokesman said, would require ""massive amounts of gas"". He added: ""When you combine that with the fact that these gases are expensive and difficult to get hold of, we are very sceptical."" Analysis Hugh Schofield, BBC News There has been an awful lot of rumour about sleeping gas burglaries in France, but precious little hard evidence. A number of doubts spring to mind: What gas do they use? In what quantities? How do they ensure it will be effective in the right parts of the house? And through the air-conditioning system? Really? In the camping-car community, there have been persistent claims about burglars using sleeping gas. On chat-lines, holidaymakers share their experiences and ask about ways to protect themselves. But again - no-one has ever appeared in court charged with gassing and stealing. No police officer is on the record. Who knows? Maybe Jenson Button was indeed the target of a gas-and-steal. The head of a security firm I spoke with in St Tropez says he has never heard of an actual case of a sleeping gas burglary. ""I don't believe in it at all,"" is what he said. Do French burglars really use gas? Button, 35, who drives for team McLaren, is based in Monaco, about 80 miles (130km) along the coast from Saint-Tropez. He won the F1 championship in 2009 driving for Brawn GP and finished in eighth place in 2014.","[""Anaesthetic gas may have been used against Jenson Button and his wife Jessica during a burglary in France, the Formula 1 driver's spokesman says.""]",['French police have arrested Jenson Button and his fiance Jessica Bouchard amid reports of a sleeping gas burglary.'],0.41860465116279066,0.14634146341463414,0.37209302325581395,0.37209302325581395,34.95654080093551
"It is the second such claim to be rejected in court this week. The plaintiffs accused the airline of favouring slim and attractive cabin crew. Aeroflot said its rules were designed to ensure passenger safety. Aeroflot said it ""does not discriminate based on age, sex, weight, appearance, religious or political convictions"". In a statement to the BBC the airline called the allegations ""without foundation"". Its application form for would-be flight attendants requires details of height, weight and clothing size. In court, an Aeroflot official admitted that the airline regards heavily-built flight attendants as less suited to emergencies, when quick action is required. Aeroflot sets 48 as the maximum clothing size for its stewardesses (L; 16 in UK; 42 in Germany; 14 in US), Russia's Kommersant news website reports. Yevgenia Magurina, whose complaint was rejected on Friday, is size 52. Before the court ruling, she told the BBC's Outside Source radio programme that Aeroflot had transferred her to night flights inside Russia last summer. She was taken off international routes. ""In October my salary dropped significantly, apparently because I did not qualify for Aeroflot's size standards chart,"" she said. ""I just felt that it was impossible to keep silent any more. I have lost a lot of money, was exhausted after night flights, so I decided to take these extreme measures. They simply told me that Aeroflot has changed the rules of the game."" Besides passenger safety concerns, Aeroflot also argues that every extra kilogram of weight forces it to spend more on fuel.","[""A Moscow court has rejected a female flight attendant's sex discrimination claim against the Russian national carrier Aeroflot.""]",['Russian airline Aeroflot has rejected a complaint from a flight attendant who says it discriminates against her.'],0.5,0.17647058823529413,0.33333333333333337,0.33333333333333337,50.64842075029927
"Rhiannon Bennett, 17, was walking with friends when she was hit by cyclist Jason Howard on 2 April 2007. Howard was convicted of ""dangerous cycling"" and fined. Under the charge there was no penalty of imprisonment. Michael and Diana Bennett will hear their local MP Andrea Leadsom introduce a Commons Bill over the issue. During Howard's trial in August 2008, Aylesbury magistrates heard he had shouted at Rhiannon to ""move because I'm not stopping"", before crashing into her. 'National outcry' She died from head injuries six days later. Howard, from Buckingham, was fined £2,200, a penalty described as ""laughable"" by Rhiannon's parents. They have been campaigning since then for the introduction of more serious penalties for cyclists who cause death. The couple will be in the public gallery of the Commons to hear a Ten Minute Rule Bill by the South Northamptonshire MP.

"The strike lasting for five hours ended at midnight and further action is scheduled for the New Year. But members of the FBU in Surrey and Kent were recalled after flooding was declared a ""major incident"". Scottish firefighters voted against a strike but have joined an overtime ban. Severe floods hit Surrey and Kent on Tuesday, with Dorking, Leatherhead and Tonbridge among areas affected. There is an agreement between the union, the government and the fire services that if there are major incidents, union members could be recalled, the FBU said. So if there are problems resulting from the storm that has hit the country, firefighters can be asked to go back and work - albeit voluntarily. Kitchen fires warning Ahead of the strike fire chiefs had urged the public to take extra care with Christmas celebrations. ""Millions of people will be at home celebrating Christmas and New Year when the Fire Brigades Union goes on strike,"" said the London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson. ""Contingency plans are in place but we're urging people to take care, to be sensible, and to remember that fire brigades could be very busy during the strikes,"" he added. ""Make sure you keep candles well away from anything that could catch fire and switch off fairy lights when you go out or to bed. ""If you're preparing a festive feast, it's a good idea to keep an eye on cooking to prevent kitchen fires."" It was the FBU's seventh strike since September. The union says the government is ""refusing to honour long-standing agreements"" over pension arrangements. Changes to the pension scheme could also result in many firefighters in their late 50s being sacked, the union claims. Union officials met with fire minister Brandon Lewis earlier on Tuesday, but it is not yet clear if there was any agreement. Mr Lewis has described the action as ""completely cynical"" and added that there were ""robust contingency arrangements in place"".

"By Hannah RichardsonEducation and social affairs reporter Only 20 of 99 councils to respond to a BBC Breakfast survey said they were advising schools to open more widely on Boris Johnson's target date. Of the 99 who responded, two thirds (68), could not guarantee schools would reopen to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. It comes as the government prepares to publish scientific advice on its plan. Ministers have been insisting that they would only be calling on schools in England to reopen in June if the scientific advice said it was safe to do so. Safety concerns Teaching unions, heads and politicians have been calling for that advice to be made public. BBC Breakfast carried out a snap-shot survey of the 150 local authorities that oversee primary schools over the past 48 hours. It also showed: The local authorities which have said they will not open on 1 June include: Blackburn, Bury, Calderdale, Cheshire East, Cheshire West, East Riding, Knowsley, Newcastle City, Rochdale, Stockport, Trafford and Wirral. It is the head teachers and the governing bodies on the ground who need to make arrangements for social distancing or keeping children within small groups to limit the potential spread of infection. Schools across England have been open to small numbers of vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers since they formally closed at the end of March. But the prime minister announced plans for a phased reopening of primaries from 1 June, when he set out the government's plans to move gradually out of lockdown measures on 10 May. Almost immediately, teaching unions and head teachers warned of safety concerns and practicalities in many schools which, they argued, made safety measures unfeasible. 'Cautious approach' And, with scientific evidence on the way the virus is spread by children limited, there are concerns the wider opening of schools could lead to a second spike in Covid-19. Teaching unions also called for a more regional approach, with local authorities being given the final call. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson made a plea for the sector to let children get back to school, and a string of ministers lined up to try to persuade parents, many of whom are concerned about a return, that schools would be safe. But, as opposition continued to grow, there has been a softening of the government's approach. On Wednesday, Justice Minister Robert Buckland, said the government was prepared to listen to the concerns of head teachers and council leaders, and hinted it might step back from the 1 June date. He also acknowledged schools would not reopen in a uniform way across England after half term. A spokesman for the Department for Education said: ""We want children back in schools as soon as possible because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their well-being."" Local infection rates He added that plans for a cautious, phased return of some children was based on the best scientific and medical advice and insisted the department had been engaging closely with a range of organisations including the teaching unions. But Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said support for a fixed date for school return was vanishing quickly. ""What is needed now is local flexibility to determine when it is right for schools to open up to more pupils."" Councillor Judith Blake, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, backed calls for decisions to be made locally. ""As there are different Covid-19 infection rates around the country, schools and councils must be able to work together to decide how and when schools open to more children,"" said Ms Blake. Councils also needed crucial testing data to be shared with them to boost confidence about reopening schools among teachers and parents, along with powers to manage outbreaks in schools, care homes and the community, she argued. Meanwhile Unison, which represents many school support staff, said members had little confidence in government reassurances that English schools will be safe to open to more pupils from 1 June. An overwhelming 96% of 42,000 teaching assistants, cleaners, technicians and office staff surveyed by the union, said they felt ministers had not put safety first in their reopening plans. On Thursday the governments of Scotland and Northern Ireland announced plans for a phased return to school for pupils, starting in August.

"Last summer about 50,000 eggs were laid at Collard Hill but the cooler spring temperatures slowed down their metamorphosis. Ranger, Ian Clemmett, said despite the late start they hoped for another good year building on previous years. The caterpillars pupate in ants' nests before they crawl out as butterflies. Caterpillar con Mr Clemmett added: ""With so many eggs laid despite the poor weather last year there's a strong chance of a bumper year but it will all come down to the unpredictable element of how the underground caterpillar food - ant grubs - faired during the winter."" Eggs are laid onto wild thyme flowers and then drop to the ground once they hatch. As larvae drop to the ground, they trick ants into thinking they are lost ant grubs and are carried into ants' nests where they munch up ant grubs. After pupating they crawl out for a flight season which normally lasts for about a month. The Large Blue was re-introduced to the Somerset site in the summer of 2000 and the first successful flight season was the following year. The reintroduction is part of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology's Large Blue Project.

Dress creator Fiona Hesford said: ""You always think the worst - but when I saw her I thought she's so pulled it off."" Worn by the star of the BBC Three mockumentary, the red polyester crepe dress not only featured Swindon on the front, but ""Mucklowe"" - Cooper's character Kerry's surname - on the back. Ms Hesford from Worthing, Sussex said she was asked to create the dress by Cooper's aunt. ""When she came to me and said: ""Do you think you can make a dress for the Baftas? I was like: ""Oh no, no, no - that's way too big for me"","" she said. ""But when she told me the idea, I thought I've got to do this."" Sporting a Swindon Town FC badge taken from a bought club shirt and white sequins to add ""that extra bit of glamour"", Ms Hesford said it took several days to create. ""My friend took the fitting, so it was nerve racking because I never really saw [Daisy May Cooper] in the dress,"" she said.

"Indoor visits will no longer be limited to 30 minutes, and can now last up to four hours. Visitors will be allowed to hold hands with residents as long as they stick to rules to stop the infection spreading. And up to six visitors from two households, including children, will be able to attend outdoor visits which can last up to one hour. Visitors will also be allowed to bring residents gifts and their belongings. However, visiting will continue to be ""restricted to outdoor and essential visits only"" in the Glasgow, West and East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Renfrewshire, and North and South Lanarkshire council areas. The changes were announced by the health secretary, Jeane Freeman, during the government's coronavirus briefing. She said a staged approach was being taken to reintroduce visiting to care homes as safely as possible. The new guidance also allowed spiritual and faith representatives, hairdressers, pets and therapets to visit care homes again. The changes will be implemented once care homes are satisfied they can be delivered safely, the Scottish government said. Ms Freeman added that care homes must be Covid-free for 28 days and have been taking part in weekly testing for all staff to allow these visits. More ""clarity and flexibility"" on essential visits was also being provided. Essential visits should always be permitted with appropriate safety precautions, she said. They ""should be supported to prevent or respond to a lessening in resident's health"", ""to help communicate when [a resident] is in distress"" and to allow a resident to see their family when they are dying. These visits are ""incredibly important for health and wellbeing"", Ms Freeman said. An 'excruciating wait' The charity Age Scotland said the changes were ""a long time coming"". Brian Sloan, chief executive, said it would be the first time family members could hold the hand of their loved ones in almost seven months. ""Their wait has been excruciating,"" he said. ""We have heard from many families who have been seriously alarmed by the decline in the health of their loved one during lockdown, in part because of enforced isolation to avoid the spread of coronavirus. ""We have been making the case to the Scottish government that every effort must be made to resume indoor visiting as the ongoing risk to the person's health by not doing so is substantial. ""It is essential that increased visits to care homes are now available to everyone, wherever possible."" 'Premature move' As the latest guidance is not clear cut, care homes must ultimately make their own decision on whether to allow relaxation of measures - and not all will be in favour. GMB Scotland shared the results of a survey of 200 care workers with BBC Scotland's The Nine. While a majority of care home staff thought visiting should remain a priority in the event of a stricter lockdown (73%), a noticeable chunk (23%) did not support the scenario. Meanwhile Balhousie Care Group, which runs 25 nursing homes in Scotland, told the programme that it would not permit indoor visits. The group's chief executive officer Jill Kerr said: ""We think it's a premature move by the Scottish government and one that has been made with no consultation with operators.

"The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) has been trialling techniques that can detect phones from their mobile signal. They are then able to block the phone, and seek a court order to completely remove the device from the network. This effectively makes the device useless, even if a different sim card is inserted into it, MSPs on the Scottish Parliament's justice committee have now approved the technology for use, after Justice Secretary Michael Matheson offered assurances that it was unlikely to interfere with mobile phones being used by people living close to prisons. Plan escapes Mobile phone use has become a major problem in prisons, with inmates using them to plan escapes or indiscipline, intimidate witnesses or to continue organising drug dealing or violence while they are behind bars. So far this year, 285 handsets and 116 sim cards have been recovered in Scottish prisons, and 76 prisoners have been charged with possession of a mobile phone. It was reported last month that prisoners at Saughton Prison in Edinburgh had posted nude photographs of themselves on social media. With mobile phones the size of matchboxes available, it is difficult to prevent devices and sim cards being smuggled in - and for prison officers to find those that are already in circulation. 'Serious risk' The SPS has been trialling ""IMSI catcher"" technology at two Scottish jails - HMP Shotts in North Lanarkshire and HMP Glenochil near Alloa - which intercepts signals inside the prison by mimicking a mobile phone tower. Once the signal has been detected, the authorities are able to match it to an individual device, which can then be completely blocked by the mobile networks. Mr Matheson told the committee that the illegal use of mobile phones in prisons presented a ""serious risk to the security of prisons, and to the safety of the public"". He added: ""These regulations will not prevent the introduction of illicit mobile phones or their component parts to prisons. ""However the successful disabling of a mobile phone will put it beyond use and will seriously disrupt the activities of those individuals, including those involved in serious and organised crime who would seek to extend their criminal activity, threats or presence beyond the walls of our prisons.""","['New technology is to be used to block mobile phones that have been smuggled into prison, even if the authorities are unable to find the device.']",['Mobile phones in Scottish prisons are being monitored by the authorities as part of a campaign to stop illegal mobile phone use.'],0.24999999999999994,0.08695652173913043,0.20833333333333331,0.20833333333333331,35.8904676089812

"In 2013 and 2014 the bank allowed fraudsters to transfer millions of dollars around the world even after it had learned of their scam, leaked secret files show. HSBC says it has always met its legal duties on reporting such activity. On Monday in Hong Kong, the shares fell more than 5.3% to close at HK$29.30. In London they fell by a similar amount. Leaked documents from the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. Shares in rival banks named in the papers have also been hit. At lunchtime, Standard Chartered and Barclays were down by 5% and 6% respectively, while Germany's Deutsche Bank was down 8%. The share price falls came against a backdrop of broader negative sentiment on share markets. UK shares were down sharply amid fears of further Covid-related restrictions. HSBC had been under pressure on multiple fronts before the files were leaked and its shares have taken a particularly hard battering this year, falling by some 50%. It has been at the sharp end of political pressures in Hong Kong, and from the pandemic fallout. Although HSBC is headquartered in London, more than half of its profits come from Asia and its shares are important components of both the London and Hong Kong share markets. Its role in a $80m (£62m) fraud is detailed inthe FinCEN leak of documents - banks' ""suspicious activity reports"". HSBC moved the money through its US business to HSBC accounts in Hong Kong in 2013 and 2014. The bank says it has always reported such activity in accordance with its legal obligations. Multiple pressures HSBC, which is Europe's biggest bank, has set aside between $8bn and $13bn this year for bad loans as it expects more people and businesses to default on their repayments because of the coronavirus pandemic. In August, it reported a 65% drop in pre-tax profits to $4.3bn for the first half of the year - much steeper than analysts had forecast. It also became embroiled in a political battle over its support of China's national security law in Hong Kong and was lambasted by both the US and UK. Cost-cutting HSBC is currently pushing ahead with major restructuring of its global banking operations. Chief executive Noel Quinn, who officially took over in March, said the bank would further pivot into Asia as its European operations lose money. Mr Quinn said HSBC would ""accelerate"" an earlier restructuring plan which includes the axing of 35,000 jobs.","[""HSBC's share price has fallen to its lowest level since 1995 amid allegations of money laundering.""]",['Shares in HSBC fell sharply in Hong Kong after the bank revealed its role in a suspected Covid-related fraud.'],0.1081081081081081,0.0,0.1081081081081081,0.1081081081081081,22.002912996350013
"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News We asked a group of women who are working in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) how the world might be compared to now, if more women were present in these male-dominated industries. Now in its eighth year, the annual celebration of women working in Stem is named after the woman regarded as the world's first computer programmer - Ada Lovelace - because of her work with inventor Charles Babbage on his idea for an ""analytical engine"" in the 1800s. Kriti Sharma, director, Bots and AI, Sage ""If there were more women working in bots & Artificial Intelligence (AI), women wouldn't be an afterthought when building new technology. ""Early voice recognition software didn't always recognise female voices, because none of the developers had been female and no-one thought to test out the technology on women (Car safety failed to take into account female anatomy - female-sized crash test dummies were only enforced in the US in 2011). ""Artificial Intelligence learns like babies do: it picks up data and knowledge from the world around it. So if that world is all male, it's going to have a very limited sphere of knowledge indeed. ""There would be more of a gender mix in AI voices - dutiful personal assistants wouldn't be largely female (Siri at launch, Cortana, Alexa) and advanced humanoid robots wouldn't be mostly male (SoftBank's robot companion NAO and, going more retro, R2D2 and Hal 9000). ""I've always been insistent that Pegg, the first accounting chatbot, that I developed at Sage, is gender neutral."" Suw Charman-Anderson, founder, Ada Lovelace Day ""If there were more women in tech, health apps wouldn't forget that women have periods and period tracking apps wouldn't focus almost exclusively on planning for pregnancy. ""New laptops and phones aimed at women would focus on technical specifications and features rather than on being pink and DSLR cameras would have smaller, lighter bodies with buttons positioned for smaller hands. ""Social networks wouldn't tolerate abuse and better moderation and curation would make the comment sections on news articles much more welcoming. ""And finally, women's clothes would get lots of decent-sized pockets in which we could put all our devices."" Naomi Climer, outgoing president of the Institution of Engineering and Technology ""Some of the technology developments under a women-only tech workforce might surround cars, which would be less of a status symbol and include more simple woman-friendly aspects such as extra storage, different body size assumptions and different features highlighted on the displays. ""We would also see healthcare technology aimed at specifically female aspects of physiology. Gone would be the days of vast numbers of women having appalling, quality-of-life affecting health issues and being told it's 'one of those things'! ""Kids would automatically ask their mums - rather than their dads - for help fixing, designing and building things."" Deborah Clark, senior director, Neustar ""As women we tend to have natural multi-tasking and negotiating skills that come with other aspects of life, particularly when it comes to balancing work and home life or caring for a family. ""From a cybersecurity standpoint, women are inquisitive and stay calm under pressure. They tend to look at problems from different angles and come up with creative solutions that may not have been thought of before. ""Cyber-attack vectors and motives have changed significantly over the years, so having this agility is critical to success in my field - especially when you're fighting cybercriminals who, at the end of the day, are trying to figure out new ways to steal from you, your family and friends in one way or another."" Women in tech in numbers Becky Plummer, senior software engineer, Bloomberg ""The reality is that there is no shortage of innovations pioneered by women - not least the handheld syringe (Letitia Geer), gas central heating (Alice Parker), residential solar heating (Dr Maria Telkes), Kevlar (Stephanie Kwolek), and even the foundations for wi-fi (Hedy Lamarr). ""There is no question that women have brought, and will continue to bring, great innovations to the world we live in. So what would the technology industry - and the world - look like if there were more female developers? ""With more women participating in the tech industry, I think we would (and I hope we will) see more products that focus on increasing the quality of life for the individual. ""It could be as simple as extending a fitness tracker to monitor our reproductive health or prompt us to seek medical treatment. Relatively simple innovations like these could democratise healthcare globally."" Sophie Vandebroek, chief technology officer, Xerox ""It's not a question of women or men dominating the technology industry. What makes a big difference is creating an organisation that is 'inclusive' for all. An organisation where all can bring their 'whole self' to work and their intellect and passion are appreciated and channelled effectively. ""For anyone to be truly happy and productive at work, they need to work for an organisation which is inclusive. People need to identify and be inspired by the people around them. ""Diversity means working for an organisation where you are not the only woman but likewise, you shouldn't be the only man, the only person with an accent, the only gay person, or the only person of a certain age or ethnic and social background."" Dr Karen Masters, astrophysicist, Portsmouth University ""In astronomy there's a long history of women making important contributions, but they've always been a minority group. ""I'm not sure the field would change significantly, but the experience of women in it would. ""They would no longer have to battle stereotype threats and constantly have to feel the need to justify their presence as astrophysicists. I like to imagine how much extra energy all those women would have to get on with understanding the Universe."" Gen Ashley, Director, Women Who Code London ""If there were more women in tech, there would be more role models to inspire young girls to pursue a career in tech.

"By Gavin HainesLondon ""I found myself at a police station on my own. The counter seemed so high because I was only a little girl and I remember the policeman asking: 'Why are you not crying?' I think about his words now and ask myself: 'Yeah, why wasn't I crying?' I suppose I was in shock."" Daniela Walther recalls the night she was caught trying to flee East Berlin. It was 13 August 1961. She was five years old. Two days earlier her father, Karl-Heinz Prietz who was a reporter at a teaching magazine, had come home with a tip-off that the authorities in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) were going to close the border between communist East Berlin and capitalist West Berlin. ""He knew they were going to build a wall,"" says Walther, referring to the Berlin Wall, which fell 25 years ago, on 9 November 1989. Knowing it would be all but impossible to move to West Berlin after the barrier was erected, Walther's father convinced her mother to flee right away. ""She was reluctant to give up her teaching job - teaching was her raison d'etre - but she agreed,"" says Walther. ""My father told us where to go, where we would try to cross, and we waited for him in this allotment. We stayed there on the night of 11 August, sleeping in somebody's shed. I remember my mother agonising and telling me to be quiet. I felt afraid."" The following evening her father came and led them to what he thought was a weak spot in the border, which was already quite heavily patrolled. ""He went ahead and called for my mother to follow, but she froze - she didn't have the courage. I remember standing next to her, listening to my dad calling."" And then the guards appeared. ""They came out of the darkness and arrested my father. They took him away - I didn't see him for another eight years,"" she says. Walther and her mother were also arrested and taken to a police station. Her mother was sentenced to nine months in prison for being an accomplice to the escape attempt and Walther was sent to live with her grandparents in the village of Stockhausen. ""Being the daughter of someone who tried to cross the border was worse than being the daughter of a murderer,"" she says. ""My grandparents said: 'If anyone asks, tell them you're the daughter of Lilo,' who was my aunt in West Germany."" Walther adjusted quickly to her new life. ""I was actually very happy. My grandparents had lots of animals, including a dog, and because of collectivisation everything was open - there was no private land or fences - so I used to go off exploring."" Walther even taught herself to ski. ""I found my father's skis, which were far too big for me, and I learned to ski in the orchard - which was probably quite dangerous,"" she says. When her mother was released from prison the pair moved to Potsdam, where their relationship became fraught. ""My mother was really quite unstable,"" recalls Walther. She distracted herself by enrolling in the army's horse acrobatics team, and performing in the breaks at equestrian events. Meanwhile, East Germany's economy was in free fall. Many skilled workers and intellectuals had fled and the Soviet Union was stripping the country of its resources. By 1964 the fiscal situation had become so dire that the authorities developed a scheme to sell political prisoners to West Germany. They called it haeftlingsfreikauf. The Berlin Wall ""Between 1964 and 1989 some 33,755 political prisoners and 250,000 of their relatives were sold to West Germany, for a sum totalling 3.5bn Deutschmarks,"" says historian and author, Andreas Apelt. ""Both sides had an interest in the business - the GDR because it needed Western currency and the West because it wanted to save people from the inhumane prisons of the GDR."" Prisoners were also traded for commodities such as coffee, copper and oil. However, neither side wanted the public to find out - the GDR because it didn't want to appear weak and West Germany because it didn't want to be seen supporting the communist regime. So the operation remained clandestine - people were traded in darkened nooks of the underground railway, the U-Bahn, or sent across the border in buses with revolving license plates. The number plates would switch at the checkpoints, so as not to arouse suspicion on the other side. In 1968, a price for Walther's father, Karl-Heinz Prietz, was negotiated. ""He'd been in prison for eight years. He was tortured - he didn't explain the methods, but they destroyed his health. I don't think he saw daylight for years,"" she says. While locked away, Prietz had spent hours writing down the bedtime stories he had once recounted to his daughter. ""He invented stories about two bears called Bumsi and Plumsi, who had lots of adventures,"" she says. ""In prison he continued to write these stories in old exercise books - there was a huge pile of them."" However, prisoners weren't allowed to leave East Germany with anything except their clothes, so he sent the books to his wife for safe keeping. Once Prietz was settled in West Berlin, a deal was made for Walther and her mother to follow. ""I really didn't want to go - I wanted to stay in East Germany with my grandparents - but the deal was for wife and daughter,"" she says. ""I think they paid 100,000 Deutschmarks for us."" When the time came to pack their bags, her mother said there was no space for her father's story books. ""She didn't bring them with us. She said there wasn't enough room, even though we took all this other junk. I have never forgiven her,"" says Walther. The two of them were taken across the border via Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse, a railway station on the frontier between East and West Berlin. It was 1969 and Daniela was 13 years old. ""My friend Gudrun came with us to say goodbye. I was very sad to leave her. She said she would come and visit when she was 60, because you were allowed to leave East Germany when you were 60."" After bidding farewell to Gudrun, Walther and her mother were interrogated by the secret services of the UK, France and the US, which controlled West Berlin. ""They asked all these questions and I remember thinking: 'Sorry my life is so boring,'"" says Walther. ""My father was waiting for us on the other side. I didn't recognise him, which was very painful for him. He was crying."" Having been so young when they were separated, Walther felt more upset about losing her friend. Life in West Berlin didn't work out for the reunited family. Walther's parents split up and she had difficulty adapting to the unfamiliar school system. ""When you're a child, school is the centre of your world and I hated it,"" she says. ""I went from being top of the class in East Germany to being at the bottom. My language teacher told me I would never get to grips with English."" Determined to prove her teacher wrong, Walther persuaded her father to pay for her to attend a language school in the UK. ""I was the apple of his eye - he would have done anything for me,"" she says. So in 1972 Walther arrived in the UK and before long went on to study languages at Goldsmiths College in London. In her second year she met her husband, Bill, with whom she had two children. Framed pictures of Berlin adorn the walls of their south London home. Walther, now 59 and a teacher like her mother, is glad she left East Germany. ""It was for the best - otherwise I wouldn't have come to the UK, met Bill or moved to London, which is a city I love,"" she says. ""But if I had stayed, then I would have made a good life over there. People were well looked after and I agreed with the principles of the state - I still do - just not all the spying and oppression."" Although she disapproves of the idea of selling prisoners, she understands why it happened. ""It was pretty mercenary of the East Germans, but they were being bled dry by the Russians,"" she says. ""For West Germany it was a humanitarian effort."" Walther's father died in 1996, followed by her mother in 2010. After that night at the border their relationship never recovered. ""She just couldn't decide,"" says Walther. ""And that's what ruined them.""

"The list was compiled using tips from 170 tastemakers, who each named their favourite three emerging artists. Californian trio Haim came out on top last year, with Adele, Ellie Goulding and Jessie J also among past winners. This year's crop includes singers Sam Smith and Ella Eyre, who have both already featured on number one singles. Smith, 21, from Cambridgeshire, lent his bittersweet soul voice to Naughty Boy's La La La, which topped the charts in June, as well as Disclosure's track Latch. Brit School graduate Eyre, meanwhile, was a guest vocalist on Rudimental's hit Waiting All Night in April and has sung with Tinie Tempah and Bastille. While those two already have a foothold on fame, the Sound of 2014 list also includes artists like Jungle, a mysterious West London electro-funk duo who have created an online buzz but have not yet revealed their identities. The longlist will be narrowed down to a top five in the week of 6 January, with the winner to be named on 10 January. The list is made up of seven solo male artists, five solo females and three duos. Bands are out of fashion. One of the duos, Brighton's riff-heavy Royal Blood are the sole representatives of rock music. They have been likened to the White Stripes and Queens of the Stone Age and will support the Arctic Monkeys next summer. Chicago's Chance The Rapper, who was named 2013's Hot MC by Rolling Stone magazine, is flying the flag for hip-hop. The 20-year-old - real name Chancelor Bennett - appeared as a guest vocalist on James Blake's Mercury Prize-winning album Overgrown. BBC Radio 1 head of music George Ergatoudis said: ""The most competitive area next year is going to be male singer-songwriters."" There are three such singer-strummers in contention for Sound of 2014. Nick Mulvey is a former member of Mercury-nominated jazz combo Portico Quartet and an aficionado of Cuban and African music. Now solo, the 26-year-old is signed to Communion Records, owned by Mumford and Sons' Ben Lovett. The sound of Luke Sital-Singh, from Surrey, ranges from rousing Mumfords-style choruses to the simple songcraft of Damien Rice. The gruff voice of Bristol's 19-year-old George Ezra, meanwhile, makes his folk-blues ballads particularly distinctive. Of the other solo males, Uzoechi Osisioma Emenike (known as MNEK), from London, is moving in front of the microphone after making his name writing songs including Duke Dumont and A*M*E*'s club anthem Need U (100%). And with a mellow soul voice that has already been heard on records by SBTRKT and Drake, Londoner Sampha is launching his solo career. George Ergatoudis said one of the dominant styles for 2014 would be ""indie R&B"" - R&B made with an independent, experimental mindset. Female vocalists Kelela - aka the sonically adventurous 30-year-old Los Angeles-based Kelela Mizanekristos - and the eerie-voiced Londoner FKA Twigs, who is signed to the label that launched the xx, fall into that bracket. And Banks, the stage name of 25-year-old Jillian Banks, from Los Angeles, has gained a devoted fanbase with her moody, intimate R&B. Elsewhere on the list, the sassy pop of Chloe Howl has seen her compared to Lily Allen and Katy B, while Say Lou Lou are Swedish-Australian twin sisters Miranda and Elektra Kilbey, who create dreamy electro-pop. The tastemakers whose tips were used to compile the list included radio DJs and producers, TV presenters and producers, newspaper critics, magazine and website editors and respected bloggers. They included Hattie Collins, music editor at i-D Magazine, who said: ""One of the strengths of the Sound Of list is the democratic, diverse range of people that are invited to vote, with people from all musical mediums from the established rock critic to the upcoming urban blogger. ""This diversity is reflected in the 2014 longlist, which has a broad spectrum of emerging artists from a variety of scenes."" The successful acts cannot already be well-known to the UK public, for example through featuring in the final stages of a TV talent show or having already been a member of a successful band. They must also not have been the lead artist on a UK top 20 single or album before 4 November 2013 - but guest vocalists are eligible. Since coming top of the Sound of 2013 list, Haim have gone to number one on the UK albums chart with their debut release Days Are Gone.","['Fifteen rising music artists have been named on the longlist for the BBC Sound of 2014 , which showcases some of the brightest new acts for the year ahead.']",['The Sound of 2014 has been compiled by BBC Radio 1.'],0.30769230769230765,0.10810810810810811,0.2051282051282051,0.2051282051282051,14.150633235143829
"It comes after an Interpol Red Notice was issued for US national Anne Sacoolas who is now ""wanted internationally"". A US official said she had diplomatic immunity, but Downing Street branded the refusal ""a denial of justice"". Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire, with Mrs Sacoolas accused of death by dangerous driving. The shadow foreign secretary has accused the Foreign Office of ""clear and repeated failings"". Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence official based at RAF Croughton, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international outcry. The Interpol Red notice means she can be arrested if she leaves the US. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles was notified by Northamptonshire Police about the Interpol notice. She said it was ""a huge step in the right direction"". Motorcyclist Mr Dunn died in a crash with a car near US military base RAF Croughton on 27 August. A Home Office extradition request was refused by US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in January. On Tuesday, the state department's spokeswoman said that decision was final. She said that granting the extradition request for Mrs Sacoolas would have rendered the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would have set an ""extraordinarily troubling precedent"". She added that the US has a history of close law enforcement co-operation with the UK, and values that relationship. But the Prime Minister's official spokesman said Boris Johnson ""has been clear that he wants to see justice served for Harry and his family"". Mr Johnson had raised the case with Donald Trump ""on a number of occasions"", the spokesman said. ""The US refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas amounts to a denial of justice and she should return to the UK,"" the spokesman added. Shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy has called for a parliamentary inquiry, in which the Foreign Secretary would have to explain ""failings"" with Mr Dunn's case. But the Dunn family spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""The White House may feel that secretary Pompeo's refusal to extradite Anne Sacoolas was final but that does not reflect the real position. ""In fact quite the contrary, as the US Embassy in London said in a recent letter to Andrea Leadsom, both countries recognise that the final decision will rest with the court following a judicial review."" An Interpol Red Notice is a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. On its website, Interpol states a red notice ""is an international wanted persons notice, but it is not an arrest warrant"". Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

"His comments come as peace negotiations resume in Cuba aimed at ending more than five decades of conflict. Mr de la Calle reaffirmed that the army would continue fighting until the end. More than 220,000 people are estimated to have been killed in the conflict, most of them civilians. ""I must remind you that the government has decided not to agree a ceasefire until, of course, the conflict comes to an end,"" said Mr de la Calle. ""If we sign a final peace accord, then the Farc will be able to get into politics. But in a democracy and without weapons, only after they demobilise."" The current round of negotiations is intended to focus on the Farc's transition into formal politics. But a Farc negotiator in Havana confused journalists by reading a statement making reference to land reform, an issue on which there was agreement in May. ""There would be no point in discussing land reform in Havana if the government continues to reduce what has been agreed to empty words which vanish in the wind,"" said Andres Paris. 'Worse than war' The talks were launched last November in the Cuban capital, 10 years after the failure of previous face-to-face negotiations. At the time, the Colombian government was accused of being naive by agreeing to a ceasefire and allowing the rebels to operate in a vast demilitarised area. But the government of President Juan Manuel Santos has decided to continue fighting the rebels until they give up their armed struggle and join the legal political process. There is huge pressure in Colombia, however, for justice for those who have perpetrated acts of violence from both sides of the conflict. ""The guerrilla will be held to account for everything that has happened during the conflict,"" said Mr de la Calle. The rebels say most of the victims were poor peasants and other civilians targeted by the army and right-wing paramilitaries for their alleged support to the rebels. Earlier this month, the main Farc negotiator, Ivan Marquez, said Colombia had to prepare for peace as the conflict was ""nearing an end"". The government said a final settlement must be agreed by November. The Farc warned of the dangers of rushing into a settlement. ""It is possible [to reach an agreement by November].

"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) says storm surges could bring catastrophic flooding to inland areas. Nearly 1.7m people along the coastlines of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia have been ordered to evacuate. Strong winds and heavy rains have already begun lashing North Carolina's coastline, leading to some early flooding. Some 11,000 power outages had already been reported in the state. Reuters news agency reports. Florence was 155 miles (250km) east of Myrtle Beach in South Carolina at 17:00 EDT (21:00 GMT), and is projected to make landfall on Friday at 08:00 local time. It was downgraded to a category two storm with 105mph (165km/h) winds, and the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it does not expect much change in the strength before the eye of Florence makes landfall. Why isn't the downgraded storm less of a threat? Fema administrator Brock Long told Thursday morning's news conference that while Florence's wind speed had dipped, its wind field had expanded and total rainfall predictions were unchanged. Floodwaters may rise up to 13ft (4m) as rivers see their flows ""reversed"", meteorologists have warned. ""So this is a very dangerous storm,"" said Mr Long. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people unfortunately and that's what we're about to see."" ""Your time is running out,"" he warned those who had not yet heeded the warning to evacuate. ""The ocean is going to start rising."" Ask a question Share this chatbot. ""Your time to get out of those areas in storm surge inundation is coming to a close. I cannot emphasise that enough."" He said that people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. What's the situation on the ground? The latest weather predictions show the storm slowing to a near standstill as it pummels the coast with ""copious amounts of rain"" from Thursday night to Saturday, said Mr Long. Parts of the Carolina coast are expecting 20-30 (50-75cm) inches of rain, with isolated regions seeing up to 40in of downpour. Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, is imposing a 12-hour curfew from 19:00 local time on Thursday. Petrol stations in the area are reporting shortages and energy companies predict that one to three million homes and businesses may lose power. Over 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, as most of the coastal region's airports are closed to ride out the storm. Hurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters. Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face."" Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

The Coast Guard has shallow-water response boats ready to help trapped residents. Is global warming to blame? The relationship between climate change and hurricanes is a complex one. Warmer seas power hurricanes. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these rare events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Are you in the area? How are you preparing for the hurricane?

"Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir has announced a strategic partnership with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a regional political organisation that brings together seven Arab states. The move comes after a series of bilateral talks and a stream of multi-million dollar investments from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. While the East African nation's government leans ever closer to the Arab world - Sudan joined the Arab League two weeks after its independence in 1956 - millennials are taking to social media to celebrate their African heritage. Skin bleaching South Sudan's secession in 2011 came after more than 30 years of civil war and a dichotomy of a mainly Arab, Muslim north and a mainly African, Christian south. The split further polarised those who remained in Sudan, especially those from the Nuba and Darfuri ethnic groups, who are marginalised in the government and in state-backed initiatives to promote a national identity. President Bashir's focus is on ""Arabisation"" and establishing Arab supremacy. This is smothering the hundreds of diverse ethnic groups in Sudan, and the country's rich East African heritage. Yousra Elbagir: Many southern Sudanese in Khartoum bleach their skins to emulate the northerners they now live amongst. Popular culture in the capital, Khartoum, is dominated by TV, film and music hailing from Egypt and the Middle East. Arab celebrities are revered and imitated, sometimes with devastating consequences. Skin bleaching creams are now an accepted norm, sold at pharmacies and supermarkets throughout Khartoum. While the phenomenon is prevalent across much of Africa, many southern Sudanese in the city bleach to emulate the northerners they now live amongst. The northerners, in turn, whiten their skins to strengthen their claim to Arab ancestry. The resultant raw, reddened skin is almost as much a symbol of the push to ""Arabisation"" as the government's political alliances in the region. So what has changed to prompt this millennial movement to celebrate afro-centricity and Sudanese pride on social media? Primarily, it is a space for identity expression that the government cannot control. #ILoveBeingAfrican Jewellery designer Nawar Kamal has made a name for herself by using Instagram to promote and sell her African-inspired beaded pieces. Photo shoots featuring Sudanese models wearing African prints, and exploring an Afro-Arab identity, are generating excitement across Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. One shoot in particular, the ""Dominance Series"" by Enas Satir and Enas Ismail, shows Sudan's ""African"" face dominated by Arab culture, with a woman in a headscarf and Middle Eastern accessories overshadowing another woman wearing braids, beads and tribal markings. This new-found - and public - celebration of African identity is not just controversial at home. When Sudanese tweeters posted photos to the trending topic ""#ILoveBeingAfrican"", West Africans asked: ""What is Sudan and why is it here?"" Sudanese users responded by flooding the hashtag with photos, asserting their right to join the conversation. Twitter feuds aside, many of Sudan's artists - from painters to poets - are drawing inspiration from this conflicted identity, using artistic mediums to capture customs and traditions that are neither African nor Arab but distinctly Sudanese. In Sudan, as in much of Africa, social media is home to the elite. The hope, though, is that this message of African pride reaches the far corners of the country. In the western and southern regions where Darfuri and Nuba ethnic groups use cultural expression as a tool for resistance against a regime that denies them relevance. Here, age-old traditions are not passing trends but an assertion of identity in the face of disenfranchisement and can often be a matter of life and death.

"By Stephen McGrathCurtea de Arges, Romania The 65-million-year-old Asprete was first discovered by a biology student in 1956, and for decades it has teetered on the brink of extinction. ""After many years trying to save [it], people were telling us that the species was extinct,"" Nicolae Craciun, a 59-year-old biologist, told the BBC. ""But we were sure they still existed."" The Asprete, a small nocturnal fish that hides under rocks, has an uncertain future and faces myriad threats. Official estimates number the population at around 10-15 specimens, which are thought to exist on a 1km (0.6 mile) stretch of the shallow, rocky Valsan. This compares with around 200 specimens in the early 2000s. But a small team of scientists and conservationists are campaigning to save the endemic fish species, also known as Romanichthys valsanicola. And they have been encouraged by a recent discovery in the river. 'One of the biggest rewards' One day in late October, Andrei Togor, a 31-year-old fish biologist, was monitoring angling fish species of the Asprete when he discovered 12 specimens in a small section of the Valsan river. ""Having an Asprete in front of our eyes was fantastic,"" he told the BBC. ""It's one of the biggest rewards a field biologist can get."" The Asprete is a so-called living fossil, which means it has survived for millions of years largely unchanged. But a mere six decades of human activity has severely impacted its habitat and population. One of the major impacts on the species has been a series of hydroelectric dams, built on the mountainous river network under Romania's communist regime in the late 1960s. Until then, the Asprete is thought to have inhabited around 30km of the Valsan as well as two parallel rivers: the Arges and Raul Doamnei. ""It disappeared from the Raul Doamnei because there was no water any more. For one year the riverbed was almost dry,"" says Andrei Togor. ""The communist plan didn't care about this endemic species. This fish is so rare because of humans."" During the spring, prominent mountain climber and conservationist Alex Gavan decided to use his public profile to raise awareness of the Asprete, which means ""the rough"" in Romanian. ""I spent my childhood on the Valsan,"" he says. ""The legends about the fish then were like myths, people wondered whether they were still in the river."" Together with biologist Nicolae Craciun and several others, he drafted an action plan to save the prehistoric fish. ""It was done with volunteers and our own money,"" he says. ""To save this species would be an inspiration that not all is lost."" On a bright morning in early November, mountain rescue worker Adrian Dascalescu stands on a mountain road adjacent to a large hydroelectric dam. He remembers the dams being built. ""I saw that water was missing on the Valsan, half of what it was before,"" he says. ""I used to see the fish and then it became less visible."" As we venture along the bumpy mountain road we pass several logging sites. Deforestation is just one of many additional pressures on the river that threaten the survival of the living fossil fish. Other threats include river fragmentation, habitat degradation, illegal waste disposal, and the theft of riverbed gravel and large stones. ""Many people take rocks and sand from the river to use in construction,"" he explains, as the river gushes through the rich alpine landscape. The Asprete is included on the critically endangered species list of the Berne Convention of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. Its environment is protected by law as an EU Natura 2000 site and as part of the Valsan Valley Nature Reserve. But campaigners complain that rules are still ignored. An official 2016 plan by Romania's environment ministry, seen by the BBC, appears to back up arguments from campaigners that Hidroelectrica, the state-owned company that manages the dams, is failing to observe regulations on how much water it should release downstream. Even by the state's own admission, this threatens the Asprete. ""The flow of the river decreases to zero, immediately downstream of [the dam]. In the summer season, the decrease in downstream accumulation flow is sometimes extremely severe,"" the document states. Another document by the National Agency for Environmental Protection states: ""For the Asprete, the most important species of fish in the area, the main danger is the non-compliance with the easement flow from the Valsan dam."" ""It's unacceptable and me and my team are here to change that,"" says Alex Gavan. The BBC has approached Hidroelectrica for comment but has not received an official response. Off the record, they insisted they listened to the environmental protection agency and respected all Romania's rules. The action plan to save the Asprete also includes ecological restoration of the Valsan river basin, an around-the-clock warden, raising local awareness — and, ultimately, a riverside conservation centre that will double up as a captive breeding facility. ""Having some Asprete in captivity could be a back-up, should a catastrophe occur on the river,"" says Nicolae Craciun, adding that they could potentially repopulate the Arges and Raul Doamnei rivers. Alex Gavan says the action plan will require millions of euros in funding, and he sees it as significant as it will be signed by ministerial order. ""It will be the roadmap to save the Asprete."" Read more stories from Romania: As with all conservation projects where humans lay waste to the wilderness, it is a race against time. However, the recent discovery of 12 Asprete has raised hopes that the population is more abundant than official estimates suggest. ""The Asprete is a living fossil, they need to be protected with the utmost importance by scientists and conservationists,"" says Mr Craciun. ""They are witnesses of evolution."" And for Andrei Togor, the survival of the fish is ""a barometer to the health of our planet."" ""It was here 65 million years ago. People cannot just destroy it in 50 years — it's not right,"" he says.","['On a tiny stretch of the fast-flowing Valsan river in Romania lives one of the rarest fish in Europe, and quite possibly the world.']","[""The Asprete is one of Romania's most endangered fish species, according to conservationists.""]",0.25641025641025644,0.05405405405405406,0.20512820512820512,0.20512820512820512,21.844598739278506
"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter From next year, the new GCSE will require pupils in England to study two religions but not humanism. The parents fear excluding humanism may lead children to believe religion ""has a monopoly on truth and on morality"". In February, former Archbishop of Canterbury the Right Reverend Lord Williams urged a government rethink. He was among 28 religious leaders to sign a letter urging the government to allow students ""the option of systematic study of humanism in GCSE"". 'Lack of parity' The three claimants asking for judicial review of the government's decision are all parents of children due to take GCSEs in the next few years. ""I completely recognise the importance of children learning about the different religions, especially in our increasingly diverse society,"" said Kate Bielby, from Somerset, whose daughter Daisy is 12. ""What I object to is the lack of parity between religious beliefs and non-religious worldviews in the school curriculum, which in the eyes of children may well lead to the belief that religion, in whatever form, has a monopoly on truth and on morality. ""This is not accurate, it reflects neither the views of the population nor the traditions of the country, and we shouldn't be encouraging our children to believe it."" The one-day High Court challenge is backed by the British Humanist Association (BHA). Chief executive Andrew Copson said the new subject content amounted to a breach of the government's obligations to ensure a broad and balanced religious studies syllabus. ""The law is clear that when teaching about religions and beliefs, schools should follow a broad and balanced syllabus which includes both religious and non-religious worldviews like humanism on an equal footing,"" he said. ""The religious studies GCSE is therefore incompatible with the rights of non-religious parents and the entitlement of young people to an education that does not indoctrinate them, even by omission. ""It amounts to a breach of the government's obligations and that is what we are seeking the court to affirm, in line with overwhelming public and professional opinion."" Faiths included The proposed course will require pupils to study two faiths and aims to develop a stronger understanding of the central role of religion in British culture. The faiths included are: The Department for Education launched the plans a year ago, saying it had worked closely with experts from all the major faith groups to develop the ""more academically rigorous qualification"", which it maintains will allow students to choose options that can include humanism and other religious beliefs. A ruling on the challenge is expected within the next few months.",['Three families are due in court on Tuesday to challenge the decision to exclude non-religious beliefs from the new religious studies GCSE syllabus.'],"[""Three parents have asked a High Court to overturn the government's decision to allow children to study humanism in GCSEs.""]",0.3111111111111111,0.046511627906976744,0.26666666666666666,0.26666666666666666,24.716987711555515
"The Watling Street railway bridge on the A5 in Hinckley saw crashes almost once a fortnight on average in the year to the end of March, Network Rail said. Its list of the most commonly struck bridges also included structures in Dudley, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk. However, the organisation said there had been an 11% decrease in bridge crashes compared to the previous year. Network Rail said there was an average of five railway bridge crashes per day nationally, with repairs costing an average of £13,000 per strike. It has started a new awareness campaign ahead of an expected increase in traffic encouraging lorry drivers to familiarise themselves with the height of their vehicle before setting off. Chairman Sir Peter Hendy said: ""We've done a lot of work with partners across the industry in recent years to tackle bridge strikes, and whilst it's encouraging to see our work is paying off with numbers now on the decline, there's a lot more to be done to cut the unnecessary delays, costs and safety risks they pose."" 'Simple steps' Network Rail, which looks after about 10,000 bridges over roads, has also written to operators of large vehicle fleets warning they could lose their licence if they fail to have measures in place to minimise the risk of drivers misjudging height restrictions. Senior structures adviser at Highways England, Hideo Takano, said: ""Around two-thirds of bridge strikes on our roads are caused by vehicles carrying a load.

"It also advises doctors to go beyond simply recommending diet and exercise. Instead, they should focus on the root causes of weight gain and take a holistic approach to health. The guideline, which was published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal on Tuesday, specifically admonished weight-related stigma against patients in the health system. ""The dominant cultural narrative regarding obesity fuels assumptions about personal irresponsibility and lack of willpower and casts blame and shame upon people living with obesity,"" the guideline, which is intended to be used by primary care physicians in diagnosing and treating obesity in their daily practice, states. Ximena Ramos-Salas, the director of research and policy at Obesity Canada and one of the guideline's authors, said research shows many doctors discriminate against obese patients, and that can lead to worse health outcomes irrespective of their weight. ""Weight bias is not just about believing the wrong thing about obesity,"" she told the BBC. ""Weight bias actually has an effect on the behaviour of healthcare practitioners."" The rate of obesity has tripled over the past three decades in Canada, and now about one in four Canadians is obese according to Statistics Canada. The guideline had not been updated since 2006. The new version was funded by Obesity Canada, the Canadian Association of Bariatric Physicians and Surgeons and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research through a Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research grant. Although the latest advice still recommends using diagnostic criteria like the body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference, it acknowledges their clinical limitations and says doctors should focus more on how weight impacts a person's health. Small reductions in weight, of about 3-5%, can lead to health improvements and an obese person's ""best weight"" might not be their ""ideal weight"" according to BMI, the guideline says. It emphasises that obesity is a complex, chronic condition that needs lifelong management. ""For a long time we've associated obesity as a lifestyle behaviour... It's been a lot of shame and blame before,"" Ms Ramos-Salas says. ""People living with obesity need support like people living with any other chronic disease."" But instead of simply advising patients to ""eat less, move more"", the guideline encourages doctors to provide supports along the lines of psychological therapy, medication and bariatric surgery like gastric-bypass surgery. The guideline doesn't completely do away with standard weight-loss advice. ""All individuals, regardless of body size or composition, would benefit from adopting a healthy, well-balanced eating pattern and engaging in regular physical activity,"" it says. However, it notes that keeping the weight off is often difficult because the brain will compensate by feeling more hungry, thus encouraging people to eat more. Many studies have shown that most people who lose weight on a diet gain it back. ""Diets don't work,"" Ms Ramos-Salas says. Physicians should also ask permission before discussing a patient's weight, and work with them to focus on health goals that matter to them, instead of just telling them to cut calories.","[""Obesity should be defined by a person's health - not just their weight, says a new Canadian clinical guideline.""]",['A new guideline on treating obesity has been released.'],0.2857142857142857,0.07692307692307691,0.21428571428571427,0.21428571428571427,19.845345330250076
"The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), which provides abortion care, wants Boots and other pharmacies to reduce the cost of emergency contraception Levonelle. Boots told the BPAS it wanted to avoid ""incentivising inappropriate use"". The company said it was ""disappointed by the focus"" BPAS had taken. Currently, the progestogen-based drug Levonelle costs £28.25 in Boots, and its non-branded equivalent is £26.75. But the branded drug costs £13.50 at Tesco and a generic version is £13.49 in Superdrug. However, Superdrug charges £27 for Levonelle and £35 for an alternative emergency contraceptive pill, EllaOne. 'Affordable price' BPAS lobbied Boots to reduce the cost of the pill to make it more accessible for women having difficulty getting the drug quickly on the NHS. Clare Murphy, BPAS director of external affairs, said: ""Most people believe women should be able to access emergency contraception from pharmacies at an affordable price."" But the chief pharmacist at Boots UK, Marc Donovan, said: ""In our experience, the subject of [emergency hormonal contraception] polarises public opinion and we receive frequent contact from individuals who voice their disapproval of the fact that [Boots] chooses to provide this service. ""We would not want to be accused of incentivising inappropriate use, and provoking complaints, by significantly reducing the price of this product."" He added that the chemist wanted to avoid the pill ""being misused or overused"". MP Yvette Cooper told Boots on Twitter: ""This is patronising and pathetic - keeping emergency contraception price too high cos you don't trust women and are scared of critics."" When asked to explain their stance, Boots released a statement saying the price of emergency contraception included ""a professional healthcare consultation"". It said: ""This consultation helps support customers in their choice by examining an individual's full medical history and any potential drug interactions."" 'Better access' Sandra Gidley, chair of Royal Pharmaceutical Society England, said it wanted to see all community pharmacies in England supplying emergency contraception free through the NHS.

"By Jenny HillBBC News, Dresden Announcing the measures at the weekend, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that an existing ""lockdown light"", which closed bars, restaurants, arts and leisure facilities at the beginning of November, had not done enough to tackle Germany's second wave. The country has experienced record numbers of infections and deaths in the past fortnight and intensive care units are filling up. What are Germany's lockdown measures? There'll be no let up over New Year either. No gatherings on the streets will be allowed, and the sale of fireworks is prohibited - many Germans like to celebrate Silvester, as it's called here, with a bang. For a country that cherishes its Christmas traditions there are precious few joyful tidings. In normal times, Dresden's old market square would be crammed with people enjoying its world-famous Christmas market. The city's Christmas lights still twinkle but the streets are quiet and, even before shops here were ordered to close, business was hardly booming. ""It hurts,"" said Astrid Rademacher as she rearranged silver decorations and antique glassware in her shop. The government has promised more financial aid to affected businesses, and has taken on new debt in order to fund rescue packages. But asked whether her business could survive, she's unsure. ""I hope, I hope. We will see. If we get some help, we will see."" A few doors down, Mario Somplatzki, whose shop sells the elegant carved wooden figures and decorations for which this region is famous, said that, despite the economic pain, it was the right decision - one which, he said, should have been made sooner. ""I think it's a good decision because there are no other plans right now."" Recent surveys suggest that the majority of Germans support, if reluctantly, the measures described by President Frank Walter Steinmeier on Monday as the most severe restrictions on public and private life in post-war German history. But what's gone wrong for the country that came so successfully through the first wave of the pandemic? Some blame Germany's regional leaders who, until now, have dithered, bickered and resisted Angela Merkel's calls for a tougher nationwide response. And Prof Iris Pigeot, director of the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research and Epidemiology, says that ""people do not follow all the regulations that they're told. We had to reduce our contacts by about 75% but I think that didn't work"". She's concerned. ""New Year's Eve and Christmas could be a complete nightmare with increasing numbers, increasing numbers of deaths."" Impatience for German vaccine Inevitably, as Britain and the US start vaccination programmes using a German-developed vaccine, there is growing impatience here that Germany is still, along with other EU countries, waiting for European regulators to approve it. It's anticipated vaccination rollout can begin before the end of the year, with the health minister suggesting that 60% of the population could be vaccinated by the summer. And already, among the snow-covered forests of south-west Germany, one family firm is working around the clock. For decades, Binder GmbH has manufactured storage units for medical and scientific research facilities. Now its freezers, which can transport and store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the required -70C, are in demand, and not only from domestic customers.

"By Roland HughesBBC News The ferry sank in April 2014 causing the deaths of 304 people, and now sits on its side on the sea bed. Experts say the salvage operation could be complicated by a number of factors. But the government is hopeful it can be lifted in one piece - and has put forward plans for how to do so. The ferry sank in waters between 37 and 43 metres (121 and 141 feet) deep. While salvage operations have been undertaken in deeper seas, the site of the Sewol is subject to dangerous currents and, on the surface, heavy winds. Two options At a press conference on 10 April, South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries outlined how the ship could be lifted. The ministry said a recovery of the ship in one piece was ""risky, but technically possible"". First option Second option One option would see 93 holes drilled in the side of the ferry to allow chains to be attached. The ferry would then be lifted by cranes placed on boats, before being moved onto a floating dock on the surface of the sea. A second option would see the Sewol lifted to a shallower part of the sea bed where there is better visibility. It would then be gradually lifted until it reached an area with weaker currents. Lee Kyu-yeul, the head of the ministry's salvage task force, said he preferred the second option. ""For plan one, there is a risk that the ferry could be destroyed into pieces if the crane wires fail to sustain it due to unexpected strong currents,"" he said. Tunnel in the sand John Noble, a director with Constellation Marine Services, a salvage company, said there was a third possible option. ""They could try and get slings around the hull and lift it up that way,"" he said. ""It depends on the sea bed. If it's sand, you can bury a tunnel underneath the hull to hook the sling there. But if it's rock, they would have to blast some of it away."" Mr Noble said the recovery would be ""very, very different"" to that of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, which was raised using inflatable tanks after capsizing in Italy in January 2012. He said: ""It won't be anything like the type of salvage operation you had with the Costa Concordia - in design and from a finance point of view."" The final cost of the operation is likely to be made public only once the salvage company is announced. But some reports in South Korea say it could cost as much as $137m (£92m). 'Much more tricky' Mark Hoddinott, the general manager of the International Salvage Union, said: ""It sounds like they will try and lift it in one piece, mainly because they suspect there are still bodies on board and they don't want to break it up. ""This will make it much more tricky. The easiest thing would be to cut it into sections and lift the smaller pieces, which isn't that challenging, technically. ""So this is going to require very careful rigging to lift it. And they are going to have to spend a lot of time ensuring that the ship isn't going to break in two.""

"A mobile testing unit has been set up outside Peter's Food Service unit in Bedwas, Caerphilly. The pies and pasties maker said it had been ""working in a Covid environment for seven months"" with safety measures reviewed on a weekly basis. Caerphilly was the first county in Wales to be placed in a local lockdown following a spike in cases. A total of 61 more people have just tested positive for coronavirus in the county, according to daily figures published by Public Health Wales on Tuesday. Peter's Food Service said as ""soon as a colleague informs us that they have received a positive result they are excluded from site and we contact the local authorities to ensure that the track and trace process is implemented"". It said any employee regarded as a direct contact of a worker who tests positive is ""also immediately excluded from site"". Last week, four staff tested positive and a further six who were excluded have since tested positive for Covid-19. It said it had also been informed about a further nine cases, of which ""we reasonably believe seven are unrelated to any other site case"". The company said health officials wanted to ""understand if there is the potential for onward transmission within the factory environment and determine if Peter's are likely to see a greater number of cases within the coming week"". Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which manages local health services, has been asked to comment. It has set up a temporary test centre at Senghenydd, Caerphilly, for residents by appointment only, and a ""walk-up"" test centre at Caerphilly Leisure Centre.

"By Jackie O'BrienBBC Scotland news Prof James Hunter's comment comes as crofters in Assynt prepare to mark 25 years since the North Lochinver Estate was brought into public ownership. He said the same powers used for community buyouts of land and buildings could be used for ""portable assets"". These include the Lewis Chessmen and the St Ninian's Isle Treasure, he said. The items are held in museums in Edinburgh and London. More than 90 chessmen were found beneath a sand dune near Uig on the west coast of Lewis in the early 19th Century. The pieces are thought to have been carved in Norway in the 12th Century, and may have been buried to keep them safe before being traded in Ireland. Six of the Lewis Chessmen from the British Museum are on long-term loan to Museum nan Eilean in Stornoway in Lewis. The new museum was officially opened by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last year. 'Back in Highlands' The St Ninian's Isle Treasure from Shetland is the only Scottish hoard of fine metalwork from 750-825AD to survive in its entirety. It is held in the collections of National Museums Scotland. Prof Hunter, Emeritus Professor of History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, said community buyouts have been successful in terms of putting land into public hands. But he told BBC Scotland: ""There are an awful lot of more portable assets that were taken out of places, like the Highlands, in the past and arguably could be back here again. ""I think of the Lewis Chessmen from Lewis and the St Ninian's Isle Treasure from Shetland. Things like that ought to be back here. ""Speaking as a historian, who has spent an awful lot of time researching material in places like Edinburgh and London that has to do with the history of the Highlands, I would very much like that sort of stuff back in the Highlands."" The British Museum said it had worked with National Museums Scotland to assist Western Isles local authority, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, in developing Stornoway's Museum nan Eilean by providing six Lewis Chessmen piece on long-term loan. A spokeswoman added: ""At the British Museum the Lewis Chessmen are part of a global collection which allows the public to re-examine cultural identities and explore the complex network of interconnected world cultures. ""Each year millions of visitors, free of charge, admire the chessmen at the British Museum and they are frequently loaned for display, not only to Stornoway but to museums across the country and across the globe."" A National Museums Scotland spokeswoman said it was ""appropriate"" that objects of national significance be held within the national collections and ""safeguarded on behalf of the nation"". She added: ""For material which is of national and international importance, National Museums Scotland has both the expertise and resources to care, research, display and share the treasure now and in perpetuity.

"Vicky Golding and Max Jowett received a set of Sooty, Sweep and Soo puppets from Harry Corbett, who invented the famous puppeting trio. Their father Derek Jowett was a friend of the magician and presenter, who they say gave them the gift when learning that their mother was ill with cancer. The auction is set for 19 November. Ms Golding, who lives in Otley in West Yorkshire, said her father was an independent financial adviser to Mr Corbett, who invented Sooty in 1948 and lived in nearby Guiseley. Her mother Jackie Jowett was diagnosed with breast cancer in the early 1970s, and died from the disease aged 46 in 1980, and she said the entertainer stepped in to help the children through a difficult time. ""I remember Harry coming to our house in Otley and entertaining us with Sooty shows,"" she said. ""Knowing dad so well, he must have been touched by our plight. Max and I were only small when mum became poorly."" Memorabilia from the Sooty shows - which debuted on television in 1952 - have become highly prized, with one puppet selling for £14,500 in 2018. The three puppets have been given a guide price of £5,000 to £7,000. Charles Hanson, from Derbyshire-based Hansons Auctioneers, said this was the first time it was able to sell a full set of the vintage puppets.

"Complex operations will no longer take place at the West Cumberland Hospital in Whitehaven, the North Cumbria University Hospital Trust said. The distance between the two hospitals is almost 40 miles. A spokesman for the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said the move ""made sense in clinical terms"". 'Understandably concerned' Out-of-hours procedures will transfer from Friday with all other high-risk surgery moving to the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle from 1 October. Two or three people each week will travel to Carlisle from West Cumbria for operations such as those linked to appendicitis or broken hips, the trust said. The RCN spokesman said: ""While some members of the local community may be understandably concerned at the added journey time, it is better to have a safe, high-quality service concentrated at a single site, rather than having expertise spread too thinly."" In July, the trust was put into special measures over death rates as part of the Keogh Review set up in the wake set up of shortcomings that led to a higher than expected number of deaths at the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust. Dr Jeremy Rushmer, North Cumbria's interim medical director, said centralising high-risk surgery at one site was something that had been considered for ""a long time"". ""Concentrating complex and high-risk surgery in Carlisle has been widely agreed for some time now and following Keogh it is an absolute clinical priority for us to deliver on these promises.

"The Managed Approach (MA) area in Holbeck, Leeds, allows sex workers to operate without fear of prosecution. One girl said she was asked for sex as she walked through the zone to school and head teacher Ben Mallinson said he was worried pupils could be harmed. Leeds council urged anyone with concerns to get in touch. Many students from The Ruth Gorse Academy have to walk through the managed red light district to get to school. They said it was a daily occurrence to see sex workers, used condoms and discarded needles lying around and felt at risk. One pupil who was propositioned said a man approached her and asked if she was ""open for business"". ""I was 13 and was wearing my school uniform walking to school. I barely got down the street and I was approached by a man asking if I was a prostitute,"" she said. ""I've been asked by sex workers if I was one of them as well walking back from school on a different occasion. ""It will happen to other children probably just as it happened to me and as long as the zone is there it will carry on happening."" What is the managed red light zone? Dubbed Britain's first legal red light zone, the ""managed approach"" to street sex work in Holbeck has been the subject of considerable debate since it began in 2014. It was set up to try to control the trade and has allowed street sex workers to operate freely without fear of arrest between the hours of 20:00 and 06:00. Local residents have held protests in the past, claiming the area was plagued by anti-social behaviour. Rules of the managed area have included no littering of condoms, a ban on drug use and that people should respect business and other properties. The Safer Leeds Partnership has stated crime, public disorder and anti-social behaviour would not be tolerated. An independent review in July 2020 found the community should have more of a say on how it was run, relying less on police. Another teenage boy said his friend had been asked for sex and another girl described how she had been followed and grabbed by a man. She said: ""I was really scared because I was by myself and it was dark. He was just saying 'I like you' and I was walking faster and he started walking faster."" The pupils' head teacher Mr Mallinson said he had also walked through the area and was ""gravely concerned"". ""There was extensive evidence of drugs and alcohol misuse, and experiencing that every day takes its toll on a young person's mental health and wellbeing,"" he said. ""Students should be free from harm and be able to travel to and from school without being worried for their own safety and that of their peers."" He has called for the zone to be scrapped and said if it continued, he feared a student could be abducted. Leeds City Council's deputy leader Debra Coupar said safeguarding was its highest priority. ""I would urge anyone who witnesses any form of indecency or unacceptable behaviour to please contact the police or Safer Leeds partnership immediately so a full and thorough investigation can be undertaken,"" she said. ""Along with the police, a designated Safer Leeds team also patrols the area of the Managed Approach and we will always take appropriate and firm action against any individuals involved in unacceptable behaviour.

"It has been ""a real struggle"" to make the usual range of festive shows during Covid, the BBC's Charlotte Moore said. But, she added, the stars and crews ""pulled out all the stops"". ""Some of the big talent and the production teams have rallied together, and we feel it's really important to have a good Christmas."" The BBC's Christmas TV line-up includes special episodes The Goes Wrong Show, Ghosts, Not Going Out, King Gary, Motherland and the return of The Vicar of Dibley. Miranda Hart will host a one-off celebrity game show, and there will be Christmas editions of shows ranging from The Repair Shop and The Great British Sewing Bee to The Hit List, The Wall and Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. The vast majority have been filmed under Covid restrictions. ""Trying to work out what we could actually manage to pull off for Christmas... I can't pretend it's been relaxing or without its challenges,"" said Moore, who is the BBC's chief content officer. Doctor Who: Revolution of the Daleks, in which John Barrowman returns as Captain Jack Harkness to help the Doctor battle her age-old enemies, was one of the few to have been filmed before coronavirus struck. Executive producer Chris Chibnall promised ""an epic and emotional feature-length episode"". Call the Midwife, another perennial favourite, was among the shows that had to be shot after the first UK lockdown. ""We were so relieved when they sent me a picture of them finishing production,"" Moore said. ""With some shows it's been easier than others to get talent and everyone together, and with some shows it's taken a lot of effort. But I sensed a real camaraderie to make this happen."" The pandemic interrupted filming for two major drama series, requiring ""herculean efforts"" in the editing room, Moore said. One was Black Narcissus, which stars Gemma Arterton as a nun in the Himalayas in the 1930s and Dame Diana Rigg in her final role. The other, The Serpent, stars Jenna Coleman in the real-life story of the unsolved murders of young Western travellers in India, Thailand and Nepal in the 1970s. It completed its filming after the first lockdown. But some shows proved impossible in the current conditions. The Strictly Come Dancing Christmas special will be a compilation of the 25 most memorable dances of all time, rather than the usual dancefloor contest, for example. Last year's biggest ratings hit was the return of Gavin and Stacey. Moore said a follow-up had never been planned for this Christmas. ""That wasn't something that was going to happen this year,"" she said. ""One day."" Other highlights this year will include: Moore added: ""It's been a real struggle but I think people have really wanted to make sure these shows could get on air.""

"By Alice EvansBBC News 1. Value for money For the men's World Cup last summer, your pockets had to be bulging with Russian roubles if you wanted a chance to see football come home (or not) with your own eyes. The best seats in the house for the France v Croatia men's final cost an eye-watering 66,000 roubles (£824.44). But don't despair. If you don't have a spare 800 quid jangling around, it's still possible for you to go to a World Cup final. The most expensive seats in the women's final at the Stade de Lyon on 7 July are more than 10 times cheaper than in the men's tournament at £75.12 (84EUR). At the Women's World Cup in France this year, you can actually watch a game for as little as £8.05 (9EUR). C'est magnifique, non? This pricing imbalance manifests itself in merchandise, too. Perhaps to Nike's credit, the official shirts of the men's and women's World Cups both cost £89.95. However, while it is free to add the name of a Lioness to the women's shirt, it costs £13 to splash names such as Kane, Rashford or Vardy across your shoulders. Nike hasn't responded to a request for clarification on why this is the case. 2. More goals The stats speak for themselves on this one. For a start, Brazilian women's forward Marta is the all-time World Cup top scorer for both men and women, with 17 goals to her name across 19 matches. So far in this year's tournament the women have scored 2.69 goals per game - just edging out the men, who scored 2.64 goals per game in last year's World Cup. The women are even further ahead in the top leagues. Over the last three seasons of the Women's Super League there were 3.05 goals per match, compared with a measly 2.76 goals in the men's top tournament, the Premier League. 3. Women stick to the rules We're not saying women are angels on the pitch (in fact, Cameroon were described as quite the opposite when they played England on Sunday). But they break the rules less often than men do. Fifa didn't provide stats for bookings in World Cup games, but we did manage to pull some together from data provided by Opta Sports for the FA, which runs England's top league games. It turns out, in the 2018-19 season, Premier League players (men) were three times more likely than players in the Women's Super League to be sent off in matches. Men were also handed yellow cards twice as often. Over the last three seasons, there were 3,777 yellow cards given to Premier League players - a rate of 3.3 per game - compared with 399 given to Women's Super League players (1.5 per game). Janie Frampton, who has refereed both men's and women's international matches in her 30-year career, said the ""streak of cheating"" that so many top male players express is in part down to ""far too much money and far too many big egos"". However, the data from the Football Association (FA) also suggests the amount of yellow cards given for fouls per women's match is creeping up. It went from 1.3 per game in 2016-17 to 1.5 in the following year and 1.6 last season. Frampton believes an increase in rule-breaking is inevitable as women's football becomes more popular. ""The women's game is becoming far more professional, and by that happening, the skill factor, the determination and challenge of the game is getting much higher,"" she said. ""Women's football has become far more important, and that's going to bring the more competitive edge, which is going to bring tougher challenges and more cards,"" she added. So if the upward trend continues, it won't be long until the women are making Zinedine Zidane's head-butt look like an Eskimo kiss. Only kidding. There's no way you can make that infamous moment look any less brutal. 4. Global competition Men's World Cup winners have only ever come from eight countries across two continents - Europe and South America. There have been four times as many men's World Cups as women's, but the women's tournament has already produced four countries as winners from North America, Europe and Asia. The greater number of teams with a genuine chance to lift that treasured golden trophy arguably makes the women's game all the more exciting. 5. LGBT+ support It's a widely accepted shame that there is not one openly gay footballer in the Premier League. In 1990, former England Under-21 international Justin Fashanu was the first professional footballer in Britain to come out as gay. The ex-Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger, who came out following his retirement in 2014, said there is a ""long way to go"" before men come out while playing in a top league. By contrast, the women's game is considered far more inclusive. When ex-England player Casey Stoney spoke out about being gay for the first time just months after Hitzlsperger, she said homosexuality was more accepted in the women's game. And West Ham United women's captain Gilly Flaherty said last season: ""Everyone has accepted me for who I am. Women's football is a sport where a player can be openly gay and no one acts any differently towards you because of it, which is a great thing."" The better levels of tolerance and acceptance in the women's game could be partly thanks to pioneer, Lily Parr. The 6ft chain-smoker - whose wages from Dick, Kerr Ladies FC, were reputedly supplemented by packets of Woodbine cigarettes - was gay, although some dispute how open she was about this. Parr paved the way for English women's footballing success and was the first woman to feature in the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. Are England women better than men? In the last three Women's World Cups, England came third once and got into the final eight twice. The men finished fourth in 2018, were knocked out of the group stages in 2014 and made the final 16 in 2010. The stats behind these results show an almost identical track record. In 2018 England men scored 12 goals in seven matches, while the women scored 10 in seven matches in the 2015 tournament. Both teams received a total of eight yellow cards. The men conceded eight goals while the women conceded seven. It might be too tough to call which is the better team for now, but the women have everything to prove when they face Norway in the quarter-finals on Thursday. Watch this space - perhaps we'll be singing ""three Lionesses on a shirt"" and naming train stations after Phil Neville before the summer's over.","[""The widespread coverage and high drama of the Fifa Women's World Cup has sparked football fever across the UK, with a record-breaking 6.9 million people watching England's most recent clash. There were still far more people watching men's World Cup matches, with 26.5 million viewers tuning in to see England knocked out last year. But there are some ways women's football is hitting the back of the net - while the male strand of the sometimes-beautiful game bounces disappointingly off the crossbar.""]","[""Women's World Cup tickets are more expensive than men's and men's World Cups.""]",0.20952380952380953,0.09708737864077668,0.15238095238095237,0.15238095238095237,10.222924442585331
