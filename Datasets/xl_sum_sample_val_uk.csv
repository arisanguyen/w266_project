"The 19-year-old was reported missing from Swanage on 7 November. Her body was found 11 days later near the Dorset coast path. Her family said as the anniversary of her disappearance approached they were ""asking people to make something to show she is not forgotten"". The artwork will be displayed online. Miss Pope, from Langton Matravers, near Swanage, made an allegation she was raped two years before her death. Her family claimed an alleged failed police investigation ""severely affected Gaia's mental and physical state"". Art, particularly pyrography (woodburning), became a form of therapy for the teenager, her family said. Her mother Natasha Pope said: ""I don't speak about my daughter in the past tense - I utter her name as I always have because I know she is still with me, every moment, in all we're doing. ""Gaia's art and poetry, inspired by the beauty of nature and the strength of femininity, is her way of connecting with her true self. In spite of all she's been through she is not defined by that. ""Our Gaia would want to provide a forum for others to find their voice and create.""

Our love and our grief for Gaia feels that way. ""The love we've felt from the community felt that way too. We want to honour that, make it visible, maybe do something to show other survivors, families who's lost someone too soon, that they are not alone."" The family said the project was inspired by the #JusticeForLB social media campaign and want people to share their art on Twitter via #JusticeForGaia. The #JusticeForLB campaign was set up by Dr Sara Ryan - the mother of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk, who had epilepsy and drowned in a bath after having a seizure in Oxford. Dorset Police is being investigated over the way it handled the rape allegation and its response to Miss Pope's disappearance.",The family of teenager Gaia Pope are appealing for people to create and donate artwork to honour her memory a year after her death.
"The Alzheimer's Society is calling on the Welsh government to produce a new dementia strategy. It wants quicker diagnosis rates and more funding for care in the community. A government spokesperson said there was a ""comprehensive programme"" in place to improve services. The society's report, Opportunity for Change, found over half of people in Wales with dementia had felt anxious or depressed recently. A second report published on Wednesday for the charity entitled Dementia UK revealed there would be more than 45,000 people in Wales with dementia by next year, with 850,000 in the UK. The study by London School of Economics and King's College London found the disease costs the UK £26bn each year - two thirds of which is borne by those with dementia and their families and carers. In Wales, 54% of people in Wales said their carer did not receive help with their caring role. Case study Jackie Askey's husband George was diagnosed with vascular dementia following a stroke seven years ago. She said the support they received was good, but she had to seek it out. ""It involved a lot of effort on my part initially. We asked if there was anything else we could do to help his memory improve and he went on a course, then I found out about a course but it didn't happen straight away. It took quite a long time,"" she said. ""I still meet people who say 'I don't know what to do or where to go'."" She said one of the most valuable things she had found was getting good support from her GP. ""You need access quite regularly to your doctor and we're very lucky. If I need access I can ring my surgery and a doctor will ring me back. I try not to do it too often but you do get a bit like having a small child. You can't ask what's wrong."" Diagnosis rates Sue Phelps, director of the Alzheimer's Society in Wales, said the number of people in Wales with dementia was a huge financial and human cost. ""What we need to to is make sure that these people get the right support that they need to live well,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. She called the government's 2011 national Alzheimer's vision a ""step in the right direction"" but suggested it had not been adequately resourced. Ms Phelps said diagnosis rates were very poor compared to other areas of the UK and needed to significantly increase, which required ""clear targets"". She also called for more funding to be switched to social care rather than the NHS as two thirds of people with dementia are living in the community. A Welsh government spokesperson said it had a ""comprehensive programme"" in place to improve dementia support services and had invested £130m in new elderly mental health facilities across Wales. It said its emphasis was on earlier diagnosis and treatment, and for health boards, social care and the third sector to work together for the benefit of dementia sufferers.","Only one in five people in Wales with Alzheimer's feel they get enough support from government, a report has found."

"He was found dead four days after being sacked over accusations from a number of women of inappropriate behaviour. Labour AM Mike Hedges has suggested an inquiry by the party could not continue because of his death. But Ms Wood said: ""We need to find justice for all of the people involved."" Before assembly members paid tribute to Mr Sargeant in the Senedd chamber on Tuesday, the Plaid leader told journalists she was glad there would be an independent inquiry into his dismissal by First Minister Carwyn Jones. It would be ""premature to make any comment about anyone's political future"", she said, referring to calls for the first minister to resign over his handling of the matter. Mr Sargeant was sacked from the cabinet and suspended from the Labour Party pending an inquiry into allegations classed as ""unwanted attention, inappropriate touching or groping"". On Sunday, Mr Hedges told BBC Radio Wales that the party's investigation into the claims could not continue, because Mr Sargeant's death meant the available sanctions could not be carried out. Asked whether she thought the complaints should still be investigated, Ms Wood said: ""Yes, I do,"" adding: ""I'm not quite sure exactly how that's done. ""One of the things that the events of this last week has thrown up is that procedures for dealing with all of this are maybe not as clear as we would like them to be,"" she said. ""But there definitely does need to be a way of ensuring that when people do come forward that their concerns are taken seriously and that they are afforded some level of justice as well. ""I think it's really important that we send a clear signal to all of those other people out there who haven't yet come forward and who may have experienced something in whatever walk of life are enabled and empowered to speak up about this. ""I've got a 12-year-old daughter, and I want her to come into a world where she's free of all of this stuff, and the only way that we are going to get to that point is if we are enabling people to come forward and speak up about it when it happens."" Ms Wood said that no party was ""immune from these concerns"". She recently apologised to anyone in her own party who had made complaints, but who ""didn't have appropriate or sufficient action taken"". Ms Wood said her party had complaints ""in the system"", but she was not in a position to talk about them. She said Plaid Cymru had reviewed its reporting processes and was taking advice from the counselling charity New Pathways. A meeting of all party leaders with the assembly's presiding officer to discuss harassment - postponed from last Tuesday following Mr Sargeant's death - has been rescheduled for Wednesday.",Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood has said allegations of misconduct by former Welsh Labour minister Carl Sargeant should still be investigated.
"It will be the fifth consecutive year that the Cabinet has gathered outside Edinburgh. As well as formal meetings, the ministers will hold open public meetings in each of the three towns. First Minister Alex Salmond said that the away-days had been ""among the most successful and enjoyable events undertaken by the Scottish government"". He added: ""They offer the opportunity to meet hundreds of people from a wide range of backgrounds and communities and hear their views on important issues. We are all looking forward to another exciting and valuable round of visits during this year's parliamentary recess. ""From the urban heartland of the central belt to two of our more remote communities, we will be listening to people across Scotland about what's important to them.

These summer cabinets are an important part of building that future and I hope as many people as possible join us.""

"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent In her latest report, Noelle Buick said that those from socially disadvantaged backgrounds were particularly affected. She also expressed concern over how children are taught, pointing out that about one fifth of lessons were ""less than good"". However, she acknowledged that a number of areas of education had improved since her last report, in 2014. The Education and Training Inspectorate (ETI) observed more than 11,000 lessons and training sessions in Northern Ireland over the past two years. While the majority of early years, primary and post-primary schools were doing well, a significant number of children were ""accessing education that is not good enough"", she said. She said that about eight out of 10 primaries and seven out of 10 post-primaries were providing ""high quality education"". However, that meant that ""just over 78,000 children may not be getting a good enough education"". It cited reasons, including ""a variation in standards across individual subjects, low teacher expectations and uninspiring teaching"". While she said most schools had good management, she was critical of the leadership in some grammar schools, saying it was ""less than good"" in a quarter of them. That compared to poor leadership in only one in 10 non-grammar schools. Her report also said it was ""unacceptable that boys continue to under-perform"" in exams, compared to girls. In 2014-15, four out of 10 boys in non-grammars got at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C, including Maths and English. That compared to just over half of girls in non-grammars. Other key findings Ms Buick blames the above trend partly on schools having fears ""over the position of the school in league tables published by the media [rather than] the best interests of the pupils"". She concluded that, while progress has been made in many areas, improvement will only come with more joint working between government departments and between schools and parents.",Northern Ireland's chief inspector of schools has said too many pupils are not getting a good enough education.
"It follows a number of drug-related deaths in England in recent weeks. The Eden Festival takes place at Raehills Meadows in Dumfries and Galloway this weekend. Police said that while they did not have information the tablets were in the region they realised ""drug dealers don't recognise area boundaries"". They have also warned about the dangers of psychoactive drugs - more commonly known as ""legal highs"". Det Con Scott Jardine said: ""We encourage festival attendees to be responsible and aware of the dangers of the substances that they consume. ""New psychoactive substances are also named as legal highs, they are sold as bath salts and plant food. ""Just because they are legal does not mean they are harmless, on occasions these substances can be as strong if not stronger than the substance they are trying to imitate."" He said it was important to recognise the risks of taking any such items. ""Remember there's no way of knowing what you are getting when you take any substance,"" he said. ""Be aware of the dangers and understand the potentially devastating effect drugs can have on your health."" He added that anyone experiencing side effects after taking drugs should contact their local accident and emergency department, their doctor or NHS 24.

"The authority had initially said it was looking at cuts of £70m in 2013-14, but said that figure was now £110m. Leader Sir Albert Bore said the situation was ""much worse than we feared"" after the Autumn Statement. Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said ""while Birmingham pleads poverty"" it was hoarding £112m in reserves. Taxpayers are now being asked if they would pay more council tax to save services. Labour took over the running of the council, the UK's largest local authority, in May from a Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition. In October, the council said it was looking at a total of £600m of savings by 2017. Sir Albert warned at the time the authority could be facing an additional amount of tens of millions of pounds for next year, depending on reductions in direct government grants. He said he thought the council could see its grant money fall by £310m by 2016-17. The council has previously said it would have to look at decommissioning entire services to help meet the budget shortfall. Sir Albert said work had already started on the budget for 2014-15 and there would be a consultation on decommissioning services next year. He said: ""It's going to get harder and harder and this is now a very different ball-game - no more salami-slicing - we are talking about removing services that the people of this city value. ""When we are taking out, over six years, around 50% of the budget the council has control over then this will be reflected in the number and size of service cuts that we have to make. ""It's not just that I regret having to bring a budget of this sort forward but I despair there is a lack of concern in government as to what the impact of their budget cuts are."" 'More than double' Ravi Subramanian, West Midlands regional secretary for the union Unison, said: ""These are cuts that have been imposed on Birmingham by this Tory-led government as part of their failed austerity measures."" He said the average reduction in government funding for the country amounted to £74 per person, but Birmingham's reduction was ""more than double"" at £149. Last month the council revealed it would have to pay at least £757m to settle equal pay claims brought by mainly women who missed out on bonuses. However, it said that amount had been included in the budgets for the next few years. Last week, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council became the first in the West Midlands to say it was considering holding a referendum over higher council tax rates. Ministers have said that any authorities wanting to increase council tax by more than 2% must ask their electorates if they are willing to pay it. Birmingham City Council said it would now be looking at a similar consultation. Mr Lewis said next year's funding for councils would be announced shortly. He added: ""Councils still account for a quarter of all public spending - £114bn of taxpayers money - so they must help act to reduce the inherited deficit. ""This year, while Birmingham pleads poverty, it is hoarding £112m in reserves, getting almost £400 more per household than the national average to protect frontline services, been given a £1.5bn city deal, £22m Growing Places Funding, an Enterprise Zone and £7.5m in New Homes Bonuses."" Mr Lewis said Chancellor George Osborne had exempted councils from the reductions government must make in 2013-14. He added: ""This will give councils like Birmingham time to find sensible savings by transforming frontline service delivery as well as reducing fraud, procuring better and sharing back offices.""","An extra £40m will have to be cut from Birmingham City Council's budget because of further government funding cuts and increased costs, leaders say."

"By Matt LeeBBC News Online Across the desk, his wife Marie, 54, colours the wings of a bird she is painting onto a vase. The couple have been freehand painters since 1974 but are worried that the skill is a dying art. ""We're all dropping off the perches,"" Mr Graves warns. He adds: ""It's shrunk to about 25 people in the UK doing completely freehand painting, because everything else is done with the aid of a transfer. ""There used to be an army of us in factories across the city and now we've been reduced to almost living museum pieces."" The couple, who paint porcelain, bone china and enamel boxes, fear their trade will not survive beyond the next 20 years because the skills are not being passed down to future generations. They have welcomed plans for a ceramic academy in Stoke-on-Trent ""in principle"" but urged one of the big pottery firms in the area to help to teach traditional pottery skills. The British Ceramic Confederation (BCC) and North Staffordshire Chamber of Commerce want to create a national ceramic skills academy in the city where the industry once thrived. A £1.5m bid to the government's Growth and Innovation Fund has been submitted and a decision is expected in December. 'Surviving, not starving' Mr Graves said: ""It depends on what skills they're talking about. ""The new modern style of skills that are needed in the industry are very different to our Victorian style, and I don't know if there is room in the industry for that now. ""We would love to be able to take someone on ourselves and train them but we have to earn a living and if people don't pay us to train someone up we can't do it. ""It's something a bigger company like Wedgwood should do because they have the finances to do it."" The couple set up their own studio in the Roslyn Works in Longton six years ago after being made redundant from Moorcroft Enamels. They said painted enamel boxes can sell for about £700, with vases fetching around £500. Prices can be higher for pieces painted to order. Mr Graves said the demand is still strong, especially for bespoke items. His wife is currently painting a set of six copper goblets with animal designs for a customer who is paying £3000 for each piece. He said: ""I think there's an upsurge lately with people buying one-off pieces and the firms that we buy vases from to decorate are very busy. ""I don't see what's happening in the larger factories but the small places are definitely busy and the industry is growing in those smaller studios and pottery makers."" Mr Graves said the couple were able to make a living from their trade but did not make a huge profit.

"The 22-year-old Manchester United forward successfully campaigned to extend free school meals this summer. He has written to MPs, outlining the help he feels some families still need. They include expanding the numbers who are eligible for free school meals - and offer them free food and activities during school holidays in England. Mr Rashford has spoken about his own experiences of using a food voucher scheme as a child and was praised for pressing the government into a U-turn on the issue. The group of supermarkets, businesses and charities - including Aldi, Asda, Co-op, Deliveroo, FareShare, Food Foundation, Iceland, Kellogg's, Lidl, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose - have formed a taskforce and backed proposals from the National Food Strategy, an independent review of UK food policy. The taskforce is calling for three policy recommendations by the National Food Strategy to be funded by the government as soon as possible: The taskforce says implementing the three recommendations would mark a ""unifying step to identifying a long-term solution to child poverty in the UK"". 'An absolute godsend' Tara Brown, 50, receives Universal Credit and disability allowance for her nine-year-old son, who has autism. She says the voucher scheme has been ""brilliant"" because he eats what she calls a restrictive diet - so prefers consistent packed lunches to free cooked meals at his school in Essex. ""It's been nice to be able to get it so that I know it's not eating into my weekly food budget that I put aside for our evening meals,"" she says. She wants to see vouchers become a permanent option for parents. ""I think it should be down to parental choice as to whether the money goes direct to the school or if the money goes via a voucher [for packed lunches] to the parents,"" she adds. ""For people that are, financially, in a much worse situation, who have children with this sort of avoidance of foods, then the voucher scheme has probably been an absolute godsend to them."" Mr Rashford said he was ""confident"" the group could help change lives ""for the better"". Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said the move to extend free school meals over the summer had been a ""short-term solution"" to stopping children from going hungry, but it ""wasn't going to work in the long run"". ""We had to think about the best way to do it, to think about how these families can eat long term and not have any issues,"" he said. Mr Rashford is hoping that, with a bigger team of experts around him, he might be able to help more children. ""We wanted to do it the best way we could, introduce the best people into our group, and see if using them [we] can push it even more."" What is child food poverty and how many does it affect? By Reality Check In his letter to MPs, Mr Rashford says he hopes the chancellor will find the funds to do so in his Budget and spending review ""without delay"". Schools minister Nick Gibb said he would be delighted to meet Mr Rashford, saying the footballer was ""right to draw the nation's attention"" to the matter. He told BBC Breakfast the government shared Mr Rashford's objective to alleviate child food poverty and would look at the policy recommendations. The first report of the National Food Strategy, which was commissioned by the government in 2019, aims to help create a food system in the UK that is healthy, affordable and sustainable. Food entrepreneur Henry Dimbleby, who is leading the National Food Strategy review, has said school meals are a ""fantastic way"" to get children eating well at school. ""The alternative to a school lunch is a packed lunch and only 1% of packed lunches have the nutritional value of a school meal,"" he said. ""If you look at packed lunches as children get less affluent, those packed lunches have increasingly low nutritional value."" Speaking on Breakfast, he said nutrition was the basis of equality of opportunity - ""you can't level up if you are not getting enough nutrition into your most vulnerable children"". He added that the status of food, dining halls and particularly school cooks needed to be raised, saying they were ""as important as any teacher"". Members of the taskforce have also pledged to spend the next six weeks using their platforms to share stories of those affected by child food insecurity in the UK. Richard Walker, Iceland's managing director, said it was an issue they cared about deeply and wanted to support Mr Rashford to effect positive change. Career highlights: The rise and rise of Rashford Mr Rashford has stressed the importance of tackling the stigma around child food poverty, and changing attitudes about asking for help. He told the BBC: ""I feel like at times people think they are being looked down on if they ask for help, and I think in this generation... that is something that should change. ""You should feel free if you want to ask for help for anything,"" he said. ""Hold your head up high and if you need help go and get help."" The footballer has met some of the families who have benefitted from the extended children's food voucher scheme, which he said had been an ""unbelievable experience"". ""Just to see the smiles on their faces and to see how much it's helped them, you know, made me happy,"" he said. ""It was good to see the parents laughing and smiling."" During the coronavirus lockdown the government provided vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals, but it had insisted this would not continue into the summer holidays. This prompted the England footballer to write an open letter to MPs, drawing on his own experiences of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up in Wythenshawe, Manchester. He called on the government to reverse its decision - which it did shortly after he spoke out. The U-turn enabled about 1.3m children in England to claim vouchers over the holidays, with the support working out as about £15 a week for each child.

Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. England's lockdown will become law from 00:01 GMT Wednesday and MPs will return to the Commons later that day to vote on the measures retrospectively. The restrictions come into force as the number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. On Tuesday, 60,914 had tested positive in the previous 24 hours and a further 830 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. 'Come together' In an address to the nation on BBC One, in response to Boris Johnson's televised address on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK had reached a ""critical moment in our fight against coronavirus"". The Labour leader said people were ""angry at the mistakes the government has made"" and ministers needed to answer questions on why they did not act sooner over locking down England. He stressed that Labour would continue to hold the government to account, but added: ""Whatever our quarrels with the government and with the prime minister, the country now needs us to come together. ""At this darkest of moments, we need a new national effort to re-kindle the spirit of last March - to come together and to do everything possible to stay at home [and] to protect the NHS and save lives."" Sir Keir reiterated that Labour would support the new lockdown when it comes to the retrospective Commons vote on Wednesday and ""join in this national effort"". But he called for the government to use the lockdown to establish ""a massive, immediate, and round the clock vaccination programme"" to ""deliver millions of doses a week by the end of the month in every village and town, every high street and every GP surgery"". The Labour leader added: ""This is now a race between the virus and the vaccine and if we pull together as a nation, we can win. ""We need a new contract between the government and the British people: The country stays at home, the government delivers the vaccine."" 'Jab by jab' Earlier at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said more than 1.3 million people across the UK had now been vaccinated with either the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The figure included 23% of over-80s in England - part of a programme Mr Johnson said aimed to save ""the most lives the fastest"". The PM said there will ""still be long weeks ahead"", but that he wanted to give ""maximum possible transparency"" about the vaccination roll-out. More details will be announced on Thursday, with daily updates starting on Monday, ""so that you can see day by day and jab by jab how much progress we are making"", he added. Asked whether the target could be met, Chief Medical Officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty, said the timetable was ""realistic but not easy"".","Sir Keir Starmer has called for a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme to tackle the rise in Covid cases."
"Ian Cobb, a 48-year-old grandfather from Wool in Dorset, fell seriously ill with coronavirus at the start of April. His family said they had ""feared the worst"" because he has amyloidosis, a condition that required a heart transplant and regular chemotherapy. Mr Cobb, who spent most of his 60 days in intensive care on a ventilator, said it felt ""incredible"" to arrive home. ""I didn't think this day would come,"" he said. He started developing coronavirus symptoms at the end of March while he was being treated for spinal fractures in hospital and was discharged by doctors who believed he would be safer at home. However, he started experiencing breathing difficulties, was readmitted three days later and transferred to intensive care to be put on a ventilator. Mr Cobb said he remembered telling his wife to say goodbye to his children and was sure he would die because of his serious health conditions. His family said it was a ""miracle"" that he survived and he was applauded by staff at Poole Hospital as he was wheeled out of the intensive care unit. After further recovery, including intensive physiotherapy to help him walk, he was allowed to go home on Friday afternoon. Mr Cobb, who was greeted by family waiting for him outside his house, said he was delighted to see his family face-to-face and joked that he was looking forward to enjoying a rum and coke again. His wife, Sam Cobb, added: ""It's amazing to have him home - it's been a long road. ""We've been waiting a long time to have him back - and here he is.""","A man who made a ""miracle"" recovery from Covid-19 has been discharged from hospital after more than three months."
"The 40ft (12m) structure was last seen in The Hayes in 1971 as part of an art project. The artwork, by Garth Evans, has been restored and returned to the site following a crowdfunding campaign. Hannah Firth, who co-ordinated the Chapter Arts Centre project, said: ""It was amazing to see it come back after so long."" The sculpture only went on public display for six months when it first came to Wales in the 1970s, before being taken to Leicestershire where it was left in storage. The arts centre's appeal to return the artwork to the city was launched last year and exceeded its £16,000 target. ""It was in a pretty poor condition when we found it,"" said Ms Firth, who is the centre's deputy director. ""We think someone had taken a hammer to it - and then it had also been painted green when, of course, it was supposed to be as black as the coal that inspired it. ""We had to have it stripped right back for the restoration but now it looks beautiful."" Just like the first project in 1971, the sculpture will only be on public display in Cardiff for six months. Campaigners hope to find a permanent exhibition site for it in Wales. Ms Firth said she was involved in some ""interesting"" conversations over potential locations. To mark the sculpture's arrival, an exhibition looking back at 60 years of Garth Evans' work is also being held at Chapter Arts Centre.

"They will represent the 1,400 bell ringers who died in the conflict. Bells in churches and cathedrals will ring out on 11 November next year and Big Ben will also strike to mark the centenary of Armistice Day. Church bells were rung in celebration when armistice was declared in 1918, after having been restricted during the four-year war. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ""On November 11, 1918, the ringing of church bells erupted spontaneously across the country, as an outpouring of relief that four years of war had come to an end. ""I am pleased that to honour that moment."" Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said it was a priority to ""keep the history of the First World War alive for generations to come"". On Saturday, events were held around the UK to mark the 99th anniversary of Armistice Day with Big Ben chiming for the first time since August. The centenaries of women's service in the regular Armed Forces, the World War One battle of Passchendaele, the creation of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the 100th birthday of Dame Vera Lynn are also being marked this year.","Some 1,400 bell ringers are to be recruited in 2018 to mark 100 years since World War One ended."

"The sale included work by Mackintosh's sister-in-law Frances Macdonald and her husband Herbert MacNair. It also featured Glasgow contemporaries including Annie French and Jessie King. The art belonged to American TV producer Donald Taffner and his wife who purchased it after meeting the then director of the Glasgow School of Art. It was the first sale of its kind in Scotland since 1933. The Mackintosh watercolour Yellow Tulips, painted in 1919, fetched £130,000 and will remain in Scotland. An early watercolour by Frances Macdonald fetched £100,000. A rare oil painting by Sir John Lavery of Shirley Temple was sold for £23,000. 'Packed auction' A pair of mahogany card room chairs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, made especially for his greatest patron Miss Cranston for her home in Glasgow, went for £46,000. John Mackie, from auctioneers Lyon and Turnbull, said: ""Donald Taffner and his wife Eleanor had no connection to Scotland whatsoever before they met the director of the Glasgow School of Art in the 1980s. ""I think they loved the story of Mackintosh and his colleagues struggling against the art establishment to establish their style in Glasgow, the second city of the empire at the time. ""I think that really captured their imagination.""

"Yousef Makki, 17, was killed after he and two friends arranged to buy £45 of cannabis, Manchester Crown Court heard. After the three fled the scene, ""some sort of confrontation"" occurred and Yousef was stabbed, jurors were told. A 17-year-old, referred to as Boy A in court, denies murder and conspiracy to commit robbery. A second defendant, Boy B, also 17, denies conspiracy to rob and perverting the course of justice. Prosecutor Nick Johnson QC told the court Boy B had arranged to meet the drug dealer on 2 March in Hale Barns, Greater Manchester. 'Took a beating' The dealer arrived in a car with two others, but refused to hand over any cannabis when the boy said he had no money, Mr Johnson said. Two youths got out of the car and punched Boy A, while Yousef and Boy B fled the scene, Mr Johnson said. Boy A eventually ran away too, leaving his ""very expensive"" bike behind. ""Having set up the robbery, Boy B fled at the first sign of trouble, leaving Boy A to take a beating,"" he said. ""That in itself would be a fairly good reason for them to fall out... [and] Boy A's expensive bike had been thrown over a hedge."" Later on, security patrol officer Michael Bowman saw the trio having ""some form of altercation"" and decided to intervene, the court heard. He said Boy A told him: ""I need your help, my mate's been stabbed."" The court heard Boy B called an ambulance while Yousef, who died en route to hospital, was leaning against a tree. When police arrived both defendants said they had not seen what happened. 'Nothing like the truth' Boy A told officers he had acted in self-defence when Yousef ""came towards"" him with a knife. ""I moved my arm forwards with the knife in my hand. I think he came on to the knife which must have made things worse,"" said Boy A. ""In panic me and Boy B agreed to make up a story about Yousef being attacked whilst we were round the corner."" But this account was not ""anything like"" the truth, Mr Johnson said. Boy A has admitted a charge of perverting the course of justice and possession of a flick knife. Boy B has pleaded guilty to possession of a flick knife. Neither defendant can be named because they are under 18. The trial continues.",A grammar school pupil was stabbed in the heart by his teenage friend after a botched attempt to rob a drug dealer a court heard.
"Since 1959, most of the collection at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in Hertfordshire has been outside. The hangar, built using a £1.9m National Lottery Heritage Fund grant, would make it an ""all-weather"" attraction, a spokesman said. Marketing director Mike Nevin said it would give visitors ""a better experience"". The independent museum at London Colney was the first aviation museum in Britain when it opened in May 1959 at Salisbury Hall, the home of the de Havilland Mosquito, a combat aircraft, introduced during World War Two. Its first exhibit was the Mosquito prototype W4050, which one of the museum's founders, Walter Goldsmith, had saved from destruction Mr Nevin said it was originally like a ""club"" where men came to ""tinker"" with planes, but the focus was now on making it ""a centre of excellence"" and to teach vintage aircraft restoration techniques. Exhibits now housed inside include a pre-war Tiger Moth, Hornet Moth, Vampire, Chipmunk and the fuselage of a DH106 Comet, built at nearby Hatfield in 1953. This aircraft is the last surviving example of a plane with a window design that contributed to fatal crashes. Mr Nevin said as well as being more comfortable for visitors, the new hangar provided better conditions for those restoring aircraft. ""We've put all our energy into this and it's a game-changer for the museum,"" he said. ""We're trying to make it an all-weather museum so there's shelter, whether it be too hot or too cold, which makes it much easier for everybody."" The new building also allows it to redisplay and interpret its collection alongside a programme of activities. ""The NHLF grant was not just for a shed,"" Mr Nevin said.

"By Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland local government correspondent The union Unison said the changes may leave some staff at the council's care homes almost £1,500 a year worse off. Glasgow City Council said staff would not have basic salary cut, but some may lose shift allowances. It said plans were in place to minimise disruption. The strike will affect 600 people in 15 elderly care homes and one home caring for people with physical disabilities. Unison said the council's changes would mean new roles for staff, longer shifts and pay cuts of up to 7%. 'No alternative' Brian Smith, Unison's Glasgow branch secretary, said: ""We have not taken action lightly but have no alternative. Again, we ask Glasgow City Council to work with us to reach an agreement. ""These changes will affect the vulnerable people our members care for. ""The lowest paid staff are being asked to take on new tasks like dispensing medicines - and at the same time they are being forced to work longer shifts and to accept massive pay cuts."" The union said the new shift patterns would mean a wage loss of up to £1,495 per year for 182 staff. Mr Smith added: ""We are concerned increasing shifts to 12-and-a-half hours - and reducing staff/resident ratios at night - will undermine the standard of care that we can provide. ""Our residents have complex needs and caring is a demanding job. We must maintain a competent and confident workforce who can give the care our residents deserve."" Glasgow City Council said only 111 out of 536 staff voted in the strike ballot. Of those who voted, 82 voted for the strike. The council said it had made changes the union wanted, including giving staff more time with residents and offering staff two out of three weekends off. Staff contracts It also plans to make up to 160 temporary staff at care homes permanent. A council spokesman conceded that some staff would see their take home pay reduced but said this was because they would be working fewer unsociable hours. He stressed basic pay was not being cut. The spokesman said: ""We have been very surprised that Unison has refused to offer 'live and limb' cover, just as we are very disappointed that Unison has moved to strike action at all. ""The new workforce plan, which meets the wish of staff for more weekends off and for greater contact with residents, has been agreed to in writing by 93% of staff. ""One of the major benefits of the plan is that 160 staff in temporary positions will receive permanent contracts. ""At a time when there is still great uncertainty in the economy with increased use of zero-hours contracts we believe it is a major plus that we can offer workers secure employment."" The spokesman said that by moving staff to permanent contracts the council could help to reduce its reliance on agency staff within care homes. He added: ""This represents a good deal for staff, the council and the council tax payer, but primarily for care home residents, who will enjoy enhanced continuity of care.""",Council care workers in Glasgow are beginning a 48-hour strike over changes to their pay and working conditions.

Divers are bringing cable ashore in Stornoway to form the start of what is the project's longest subsea link. It is one of the most ambitious phases of a massive infrastructure project. The roll-out will reach communities which could never have hoped to receive fibre broadband. In total, 250 miles of subsea cable will be laid off the west coast. A specialist ship using a submersible plough and remotely-operated vehicles is burying the double-armoured cable in the seabed. The cable will run under the Minch to Ullapool. The Scottish government has said superfast connections will make remote communities more economically viable in the long term. However, some people in the most remote areas have expressed concerns that they are part of the remaining 5% who will not enjoy faster broadband at the end of the project.",Work is starting to lay the longest section of subsea cable bringing superfast broadband to some of Scotland's most remote island communities.
"The complex, subject to a £13m overspend, opened in November 2010, but the top floor is still not complete. Conservative opposition leader on Corby Borough Council, David Sims, called the Cube a ""waste of taxpayers' money"". Despite admitting it was ""disappointing"" further repairs are needed, council leader Tom Beattie said it was a ""fantastic iconic building"". The Cube houses council offices, a library, theatre and a register office. A Freedom of Information request from the BBC revealed £47.9m has been spent on the building, which had an original budget of £35m. In August 2013, £600,000 was put aside to fix leaking roofs and complete work on possible office space. 'Helter skelter' Work to the roof garden was completed in July 2014 at a cost of £322,000. A helical staircase which had been described by building inspectors as ""dangerous, like a helter skelter"" has also been repaired at a cost of £27,000. But work is still needed to bring the top floor of the Cube up to standard, including installing a curtain wall and re-roofing. Councillor Sims said the building was ""pleasing to the eye"" but has been a ""poorly managed, waste of taxpayers money"". He said: ""It is going to be a big tax burden. The running costs are so extreme."" Councillor Beattie said the authority was continuing to look into ways of recouping the costs of ongoing repair work. But he said the Cube was ""a real hub of activity"" accommodating thousands of visitors every month. ""The building is a major part of the regenerated town centre, which the people of Corby can be proud of,"" he said.",Work to repair the multi-million pound Corby Cube is ongoing more than five years after it was opened.
"By James ShawBBC Radio 5 live Scotland correspondent Alistair McDonald is looking intently into a mash tank at the new Clydeside Distillery in Glasgow. This is just the start of the whisky-making process, as the sugar in the mix begins to turn into alcohol. It is still a long way from distillation and then maturation, which sometime next year will yield the first product which can be sold as whisky. It is a complicated business. And Alistair should know as he has been doing it for more than 30 years, first on Islay and now in the brand new Clydeside distillery in Glasgow. His boss, Andrew Morrison, says that it's also extremely time consuming. He explains: ""Where you're always striving to get to is a 10 or 12-year-old as your flagship product out in the market place. ""So you're looking at pretty close to 20 years as an overall project. And so that has its challenges in itself from a finance point of view, huge capital expense upfront. ""And so you have to be very, very committed to what you're doing and passionate about what you're doing and believe that you're really going to deliver something of high quality to the marketplace."" 'So different to anything I've tasted' Given that background, you might expect Andrew and Alistair to be somewhat askance at a whisky product which can be made in 24 hours. But Californian company, Endless West, insists it can be done. They say they have analysed the composition of whisky at a molecular level which means they can recreate the taste using natural ingredients but without any maturing. Whisky-making goes back generations in the Morrison family so I wondered if Andrew might like to try this new competitor. In his small office at the distillery, he takes a sip and then pauses for some time - apparently lost for words. Not necessarily in a good way. He says: ""I think it would be a fun product to have comparable tastings with, because it's so different to anything I've tasted that's classed as whisky. Obviously it's very young. You do get a lot of the characteristics you expect with young whiskies, which is quite strong alcohol coming through. ""But there's nothing really there to soften it. I'm not getting any kind of citrusy notes. I'm not getting any smoke. So, I'd say it's quite lacking in character."" I spoke to Alec Lee, the boss of Endless West, who explained to me the concept of his new product. From his California base, he says: ""For us there's this analogy of electronic music for whisky. There's a traditional way of making music that involves various instruments and then somebody comes along one day and says, you know, I can express this art form digitally and that sort of opens the door to new mechanisms of expressing this traditional craft."" Authentic taste? The company doesn't yet have big plans to market its product outside the US but that might happen, particularly if a post-Brexit trade deal makes it easier to export to the UK. It's a long-standing ambition of American trade negotiators to get rid of the restrictions which mean that anything called whisky has to be matured for at least three years. And so to the really important taste test, not by a rival producer, but by the great Scottish public. Some were sceptical, saying it didn't smell like whisky and ""It'll never beat a nice malt"". Others were astonished to learn it had been made in 24 hours and worried that it might ""tank"" Scotland's whisky industry. But there were fans as well. One woman told me that it ""smelt more of apricot or peach"" and was ""very smooth, very nice"". Another taster suggested that they must have sneaked in some real Scotch to achieve such an authentic taste. All of which suggests that the industry in Scotland might have something to worry about, if it does become easier to sell whisky products in Scotland that are not made here and don't have to stick to the existing rules about how long it has to mature. However, the Scotch Whisky Association says it does not expect the status of Scotch to change. Nevertheless, California businessman Alec believes time is on his side. He thinks a whole range of factors means that synthesised food and drink will be a much bigger part of what we consume in the future, whatever the fate of this particular product and Britain after Brexit.","A key ingredient of great whisky is time, lots of it. But a US distillery is questioning that notion by making its whiskey in just 24 hours. So, will this ""fast-drink"" product prove a challenge to the Scotch whisky industry?"
"By Bethan LewisBBC Wales News The Conservatives want this election to be about leadership - the ""strong and stable"" kind as their mantra goes. So far their campaign has focused relentlessly on Prime Minister Theresa May. Labour in Wales have chosen to focus on their Welsh leader rather than UK party leader Jeremy Corbyn. And set-piece televised interviews could provide a publicity boost for other leaders such as Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood and the Liberal Democrats' Tim Farron. Broadcasters' current plans would also give a platform for UKIP's Paul Nuttall and the Green Party's co-leader Caroline Lucas. In an election which decides who will be prime minister, it is inevitable the leaders are front and centre during the campaign and have a major influence on their parties' electoral fortunes. I went to Dinas Powys Cricket Club in Vale of Glamorgan to watch an early season mid-week match against Penarth. I asked the man in charge, Dinas' captain Gareth Storey, whether the skills that make a good sporting leader also apply to politics. ""I think they are very similar,"" he said. ""I think earning the respect of your team mates, getting everyone to come together - to gel together as a single unit is really, really crucial."" And some of the Penarth team waiting to bat told me what appealed to them in a party leader. ""A certain amount of charisma is needed, somebody who's a very articulate speaker,"" one said. ""It's all about resilience - it's very easy to be a great leader when everything's going well and you're riding that wave of success, but it's about when you get those knockbacks, it's about how you respond to those,"" said another. Labour in Wales have opted to put the Welsh leader Carwyn Jones at the forefront of their campaign. It's a sensible strategy and ""no surprise"", said Jo Kiernan, his former chief of staff in the Welsh Government. ""There are very good reasons for that - it partly takes away from the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn but there is a Labour government here, there's a record,"" she said. While the profile of other party leaders, particularly Plaid's Ms Wood, has been boosted by televised debates in the past, political commentator Valerie Livingston said they face a particular challenge this time round. ""There's been a real trend towards presidential style general elections over recent election cycles. It has become less about which party has the best policies and increasingly about which party has the best leader to lead the UK,"" she said. ""The focus on Theresa May versus Jeremy Corbyn does make it incredibly hard for Plaid Cymru, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP to get their message across in this election - quite simply the story is not about them,"" she added. There is certainly intense scrutiny of those at the helm. Lord Bourne led the Welsh Conservatives through assembly election campaigns. ""It's relentless,"" he said. ""You've got not just the media but also the door-knocking, the visiting, the listening to people, the handling of presentations and so on - all of that is crucially important. ""But with Theresa May as prime minister, of course it's a thousand-fold that because she's got all the international obligations to carry out as prime minister while the campaign is going on, her own constituency to nurse at the same time as she's going to all parts of the country."" Back in Dinas Powys I asked one of the players how the party leaders will impact on how he votes? ""The figurehead is what you look at, it's the news that you listen to,"" he said. ""It's everything you hear and see, so they are totally integral certainly to my vote, and to pretty much everyone else's vote.""","As well as electing a local MP, the general election is also about choosing the prime minister. This campaign, more than most, has focussed on the party leaders. So will it be the personalities or policies that determine where voters put their cross on polling day?"
"By Mark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondent The Profumo affair was a sinister cocktail of high-society vice, drugs, race - one of the bit-part players was a West Indian - and espionage. It spilled on to the floor of the Commons and mortally wounded a prime minister. John Profumo's demise was summed up in a neat piece of doggerel: ""To lie in the nude may be rude, but to lie in the House is obscene."" His indiscretions would probably have been fatal to a cabinet minister in a highly sensitive post - but what sealed his doom was that he told a direct lie to Parliament. He was goaded into it by George Wigg, now an almost forgotten member of Harold Wilson's kitchen cabinet - his coterie of advisers, courtiers and odd-job men. 'Wiggery-pokery' Wigg was known for his expertise in the political undergrowth - ""wiggery-pokery"" - and he had worked hard to ensure Labour exploited the series of murky sexual and spying scandals that dogged the latter part of Harold Macmillan's premiership. With a fine grasp of parliamentary procedure and legal niceties, George Wigg brought the Profumo affair into the public domain with a Commons speech. ""There is not an Hon Member in the House, nor a journalist in the press gallery, nor do I believe there is a person in the public gallery who, in the last few days has not heard rumour upon rumour involving a member of the government front bench,"" he said. ""That being the case, I rightly use the privilege of the House of Commons - that is what it is given to me for - to ask the home secretary, who is the senior member of the government on the Treasury bench now, to go to the Dispatch Box. ""He knows that the rumour to which I refer relates to Miss Christine Keeler and Miss Davies and a shooting by a West Indian... and, on behalf of the government, categorically deny the truth of these rumours."" That provoked a hurried meeting of cabinet ministers in which Profumo flatly denied any relationship He also denied that the word ""darling,"" with which he began an affectionate letter to Miss Keeler, which was then in circulation, amounted to a confession of adultery. 'No impropriety' One of the ministers present, Iain Macleod, later told a journalist friend at the Spectator that he had posed the question in the most blunt terms - had they had sex? Startlingly, they believed his denial. So John Profumo was sent into the Commons to deliver a personal statement on 22 March 1963. The key phrase was: ""Miss Keeler and I were on friendly terms. There was no impropriety whatsoever in my acquaintanceship with Miss Keeler."" Caught out, he resigned. George Wigg's intervention had lifted the lid on a web of intrigue in the upper echelons of society and a colourful cast of characters, including Stephen Ward. The society osteopath was subsequently charged with living off the immoral earnings of Ms Rice-Davies and Ms Keeler. Ms Rice-Davies, who never actually met Profumo, later testified at Stephen Ward's high-profile trial and became notorious for claiming to have had an affair with the peer Lord Astor and for dismissing his denial when in the witness box. With Profumo disgraced, the political spotlight then turned on his prime minister. Harold Macmillan came under sustained attack. His critics thought he'd handled what could have proved to be a grave national security scandal far too casually and should have realised he'd been lied to. In the absence of an actual national security leak - there was no evidence that any information had found its way from John Profumo to one of Christine Keeler's other boyfriends, a Soviet naval attache - that was the most deadly line of attack. In a Commons debate, opposition leader Harold Wilson savaged the ""indolent nonchalance of the prime minister's attitude"", and attacked a decadent aristocratic elite for casually exploiting working-class girls and covering up the risks its conduct posed to national security. But the killer blow came from a sacked ex-minister, Nigel Birch, who chose the debate to take his revenge. 'Lost leader' With dismissive elegance, he skewered Harold Macmillan for accepting John Profumo's assurance that there was no impropriety: ""There seems to me to be a certain basic improbability about the proposition that their relationship was purely platonic. What are whores about?"" And he ended with a literary flourish - quoting lines from Robert Browning's poem, The Lost Leader. ""Let him never come back to us! There would be doubt, hesitation and pain. Forced praise on our part - the glimmer of twilight, Never glad confident morning again! Never glad confident morning again!"" The young Peter Tapsell - now the longest-serving MP in the Commons and the Father of the House - was sitting behind the prime minister, and could see him tense as he recognised Browning's lines and realised what was to come. When the words were uttered, he recoiled as if slapped in the face. Press comment on the debate and Macmillan's performance was scathing - ""Mac: The End"", ""The Stag at Bay"", ""The Lost Leader"", ""A Broken Man Close to Tears"". In his Diaries, Tony Benn wrote: ""It is now only a matter of time."" That debate was in June 1963 - by October, the ailing Macmillan had resigned.","Mandy Rice-Davies, who has died aged 70, was, along with her friend Christine Keeler, at the heart of a classic political scandal."
"Bank of Scotland chief economist Donald MacRae said businesses had a ""challenging"" start to the third quarter of the year. The Bank of Scotland Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) was still positive in July, unlike the UK as a whole. But the survey showed a slowdown in manufacturing orders, at the fastest rate since December 2010. New business being placed with Scottish private firms fell for the first time in eight months. Managers reported prices rising more steeply than was the case across the UK as a whole, while recruitment was continuing at a modest pace, mostly in the service sector. The PMI includes elements of output and demand, forward orders, backlogs of work, input and output prices as well as recruitment. An index above 50 indicates growth, and below 50 shows contraction. The PMI for July in Scotland was 51, down from the June figure of 52.5. Prof MacRae said: ""The July PMI suggests growth in the private sector of the Scottish economy was marginal with a fall in manufacturing output offset by continuing growth in service activity. ""The Scottish economy is struggling to maintain growth momentum in the face of the global slowdown. Low or no growth is in prospect for the rest of 2012."" A Scottish government spokesman responded to the PMI figures: ""This is further evidence that the Scottish economy is demonstrating greater resilience than the UK as a whole. ""For the 19th consecutive month, it shows an increase in overall output across Scotland's manufacturing and services sectors, and despite a slowing in expansion of activity, performance in Scotland remains stronger than it is across the UK, where activity contracted."" He went on to call for the UK Treasury to do more to stimulate growth.",A leading economist has said Scotland faces either a low rate of growth or no growth at all for the rest of the year.
"It is part of an initiative by Lynne Baird who believes her son Daniel could have been saved by such a kit when he was stabbed in Birmingham in 2017. City of London Police said the move would ""help Daniel's memory go on in the lives that will be saved"". It is working with the foundation set up by Mrs Baird in her son's name. The specialist kits, which have already been introduced in Birmingham, include items such as a tourniquet, bandages and a foil blanket. Mr Baird, 26, was stabbed to death on a night out in Digbeth, following a row with a stranger. Carlton Donaldson, 24, was jailed for life in February. Without a first aid kit available on the night, he died shortly after arriving at hospital due to catastrophic bleeding, City of London Police said. The force, which is funding the roll-out of the kits to venues in the Square Mile, said the move would make the area as ""safe as possible"". Alistair Sutherland, its assistant commissioner said it was proud to support the initiative ""as part of Lynne's passionate campaign in memory of her son"". ""Daniel's death was a tragedy that no parent should ever have to suffer,"" he said. Mrs Baird said she hoped other forces would join its campaign and ""help make these kits available up and down the country"".

"By Sarah DickinsBBC Wales economics correspondent Meat processing plant Randall Parker Foods in Llanidloes, Powys, warned it may lose a third of its 150 workers unless new border controls change. The company processes one million lambs a year, half of which are exported to the European Union. The UK government said they are working to help exporters with the new rules. Randall Parker Food's general manager Dale Williams said the UK's new post-Brexit trading relationship with the EU ""means extra cost, tying someone up all day to do the paperwork for one vehicle"". ""If there's multiple products it can take hours per product because we have to send the documents off to be verified before we can release the vehicle to go on its journey,"" he said. ""As it stands today we're operating for virtually nothing. We're doing it for the sake of keeping the doors open at the moment."" Some staff have already been furloughed and Mr Williams fears he could lose a third of his business ""which will make the company seriously unviable"". ""If the export paperwork and documentation and controls either side of the border continue, I think we will have to make redundancies,"" he said. Freight costs For importers there are big changes too - like Daniel Lambert, who imports wines from the EU for the company he runs in Bridgend. He said it has taken him 20 days to get the declaration he needs so the wine producers he buys from can begin the process of sending over his purchases. He was a supporter of the UK remaining in the EU, but said: ""This isn't about Brexit, this isn't about a desire for the EU. ""This is about the UK government getting its act together and getting a system that is easy to use, that the layperson can look at, because otherwise you're going to have to use customs brokers for everything and that's just going to put unnecessary costs on by the import and export. ""It's not good for the consumer, and it's raising prices when they don't need to rise."" Mr Lambert added that his freight costs had nearly doubled because of the price importers have to pay for customs declarations. Consignments of goods can also be delayed if other businesses using the same haulier have not produced the correct paperwork. Mr Lambert said other problems at ports because of Covid-19 and stockpiling were exacerbating the situation, which he said was more than teething problems. 'Reams of paperwork' Farmers Fresh - a co-operative of 2,700 farmers which has a plant in Wrexham - has been exporting to the EU for 20 years. Three-quarters of the one million sheep they process are for EU customers - and director Mike Gooding said trading with the EU was now like ""being a salmon swimming up river"". ""It's not helped because the rules and regulations are not clear and there is inconsistent interpretations of those rules,"" he said. Mr Gooding added there was strong demand for Welsh lamb in Europe but problems now are ""a result of interfering with a system that was working fine and imposing on it a system that is not fit for purpose"". He said that his company has looked at new markets around the world, but in most cases New Zealand is already exporting lamb there. ""Simply turning up and waving our flag and trying to establish our credentials is not a guaranteeing trade in other parts of the world,"" Mr Gooding said. ""We are dealing with reams and reams of paperwork. The electronic systems, the databases need to be properly installed and properly defined."" The UK Government acknowledged they are ""aware of a small number of issues"" since 1 January but added ""overall businesses are adjusting well"" to the new rules and said trade ""continues to flow smoothly"". ""Our agri-food industry is vital, and we want to help businesses take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead,"" the UK Government spokesperson said. ""We are working closely with exporters to help them understand the new requirements.""","One of Wales' largest lamb exporters says the extra cost and paperwork of selling meat into the EU means it is making ""virtually nothing""."

"Archbishop John Davies said the floods of February 2020 followed by the coronavirus pandemic have ""wrecked lives, homes, livelihoods and hopes"". But he also urged people to find ""love and light"" in acts of kindness and generosity. First Minister Mark Drakeford thanked people for staying home in his message. In his Easter message, Archbishop Davies said: ""Just when we thought, whatever our political views, that the result of the General Election in December 2019 would mean that the seemingly endless political writhing and posturing around the Brexit event would soon be over, came both the warning and then the reality of devastating storms which wrecked lives, homes, livelihoods and hopes. ""And then, and still now and for a good deal of the foreseeable future it seems, coronavirus sweeps much of the world, leaving it, in many places, in lockdown, a pattern of life imposed upon us, for our good and the good of others, the like of which few have ever before experienced. ""A cloud of sickness and distress hangs over many nations, communities and families; precious lives have been lost, healthcare and other services are reaching breaking point, and an entire way of life, thought to be unassailable is in tatters. ""But there, in the very heart of it, amidst all the mess and worry and suffering and inconvenience and darkness, are love and light, love and light which nothing can extinguish."" In his Easter message, First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Usually, the Easter bank holiday is a time when families and friends would come together, but this year will be very different for most of us, as we stay at home to protect ourselves and our loved ones."" He added there were ""some early signs"" the restrictions were helping to slow the spread of the virus, but also warned there was ""still a long way to go"". ""I know that staying at home for extended periods is difficult, and families all over Wales are making many sacrifices every single day. But these rules are there to protect us and our loved ones. ""Not going to religious and social gatherings will help to keep our families and our communities safe.""","The world is living under ""a cloud of sickness and distress"", the Archbishop of Wales has said in his Easter message."
"The steel structure will take the Ffestiniog Railway line over the new road at Minffordd, on the Penrhyndeudraeth side of the town. In preparation for the work railway staff have removed signals and a stretch of track at the site dating back to 1835. The railway line should reopen to passengers in March. The work is being carried out by Balfour Beatty and Jones Bros Civil Engineering as part of the bypass construction for the assembly government. Bypass workers will dig down 20 ft (6m) to the level of the new road at the site. Alun Jones, public liaison officer for the project, said the bridge was a major milestone. ""We are working to ensure there is minimal disruption to this much-loved rail route,"" he said. The new section of the A487 will improve journey times, and ease congestion at Tremadog, Porthmadog and Minffordd. Part of the new road past Tremadog is expected to be ready in the middle of this year, and the entire bypass finished by the beginning of 2012. Clare Britton, commercial manager at Ffestiniog and Welsh Highland Railways, added: ""The bridge represents a fairly significant alteration to the line at Minffordd. ""We have a good relationship with the bypass team and are happy to give the project our full support for the benefits it will bring the area as a whole.""",Work is starting on a rail bridge to carry historic steam trains over the new £35m Porthmadog bypass.
"The bank announced earlier this month that it plans to shut a further 62 branches across Scotland Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, told Theresa May that RBS was ""turning their backs"" on communities. And he called on her to tell RBS chief executive Ross McEwan that the closures must be reversed. Mrs May responded by saying that branch closures were a commercial decision and that alternative services were in place for vulnerable customers. Speaking at Prime Minister's Question, Mr Blackford pointed out that the UK government had bailed out RBS in 2008 at a cost of £45bn - with the government still owning a 70% stake in the bank But Mr Blackford said the bank was now closing 259 branches across the UK - including 197 operated under the NatWest brand. He added: ""If the prime minister recognises the importance of this, she should be summoning Ross McEwan into see her and making it clear that we will not accept towns and villages up and down the United Kingdom losing banking services. ""There are 13 towns in Scotland where the last bank will be going. ""This is not acceptable. It is about time the prime minister accepted her responsibilities."" He went on to ask: ""Given we are the majority shareholder, will the prime minister step in and tell the Royal Bank of Scotland to stick to their commitment and not close the last bank in town?"" When it announced the closures, RBS said the number of customers using its branches in Scotland had fallen by 44% since 2012, while the number of regular mobile users had increased by 39% since 2015. And it said it was ""investing in our more popular branches and shaping our network, replacing traditional bricks and mortar branches with alternative ways to bank, including community bankers, mobile nank on wheels, and post offices, so that we can reach even more customers"". Responding to Mr Blackford, the prime minister said the decision to open and close branches was a commercial one taken by the bank, without intervention from the government. 'Impact on communities' She said: ""But we do recognise the impact this has on communities, and the secretary of state for Scotland raised concerns that the House have expressed on this issue in his meeting with RBS. ""Of course more people are banking online. This is having an impact, but we do want to ensure that all customers, especially vulnerable ones, can still access over the counter services."" Mrs May later stepped into the debate about taxation in Scotland, saying Thursday's budget would be a ""real test"" for the Scottish government, which is widely expected to announce income tax increases for higher earners. The prime minister did not say what the level of taxes should be in Scotland, but added that the Scottish government would be watched very closely.",An SNP MP has urged the prime minister to tell the head of the Royal Bank of Scotland that its recent decision to close branches is unacceptable.
"Eastern High School in Cardiff launched on Monday, bringing together about 1,500 pupils from the former Rumney and Llanrumney high schools.

Pupils have come together to form the new super-school on the former Rumney High site in the east of the city. But a statement posted on the school website apologised that the new super-school was closed due to ""unforeseen emergency maintenance work"". ""We apologise for the short notice and inconvenience,"" it said. ""We will keep you updated and are working to open the school as soon as possible.""

"By Keiligh BakerBBC News Cutlery clinks as people eat and chatter with those on neighbouring tables and children shout greetings as friends from school come through the door. But Eggs & Bread in Walthamstow is not your usual brunch spot. Customers can sit down, enjoy a hearty breakfast and walk out - without paying. The project is one of dozens of not-for-profit ""pay-what-you-like"" cafes popping up across the UK. Customers are asked to donate as much as they like - or are able - when they visit. And if they can't pay? No problem. Outside Eggs & Bread, a sign boasts it offers the shortest menu on the street - just boiled eggs, toast and porridge, with tea, coffee and orange juice to drink. Those that can afford to are asked to pop their money into the discreet ""contributions"" box mounted on the wall, so no-one ever really knows how much others have paid - or not paid. The cafe went viral on Twitter last week when one man revealed he paid £20 for breakfast there, but staff say it is not about the money. ""If you are a City broker or simply broke - everyone's welcome,"" said owner Guy Wilson. ""Whether you're catching up with friends, or just want somewhere comfy to grab a bite, we're here, and at no charge."" Guy, who works in insurance, has decided not to run Eggs & Bread as a charity, but as a not-for-profit business. The cafe, he insists, is an ""equaliser"" allowing people from all walks of life to sit down and talk to one another over a good breakfast by ""taking money out of the situation"". Regular Sheilla Addy-Tely, an author, pops in two or three times a week with her son Ethan, six, before school. ""Sometimes we come because it's the easy breakfast option, sometimes finances are a bit stretched and when we can we make it up,"" she says. ""I enjoy it so much and we've both made friends."" ""Are we going to pay today, mummy? I think we should,"" Ethan cheekily interjects. Sheilla laughs and confirms they will indeed be paying. The cafe is also unusual in that customers serve themselves - they grab an egg (or two) from a basket, along with an egg timer, and place them in a specially built rack. They toast their own bread and make themselves drinks - a process particularly appealing to the many children who visit. Illustrator Louise Pemberton visits the cafe regularly with her husband, Simon, also an illustrator, and their two children. ""We've been coming here for the last four months or so, about three times a week,"" she says. ""It's almost like being on holiday, there's such a nice vibe and everyone is so friendly,"" Simon added. The clientele is an unusual mix of parents popping in with their children before school, elderly people, professionals, adults with special needs and those who just fancy a chat. Communal tables ensure people sit side by side with strangers and more often than not, conversations ensue. Juma Dimmock brought her husband, Warren, and children Rayyaa and Khalid along for the first time after she attended a coffee morning at the venue. ""It's the first time we've all come here, but we thought we would try it out,"" she says. ""It's really nice and so handy as their school is really close by. ""Normally Khalid won't eat eggs at home but he has today - we will definitely be coming back."" Others visit the cafe as a chance to catch up and have a chat, like regulars Julie and Kate. ""We really like it here,"" says Julie. ""The people who work here are lovely and it's always so clean."" Elsewhere, projects have been set up to help people struggling to put a meal on the table or for environmental reasons. Many use donated foods from supermarkets, restaurants and suppliers that would otherwise have gone to waste. The Real Junk Food Project, based in Wakefield, offers ""pay-what-you-like"" cafes selling food that would have been thrown out. It wants to end food waste, with owner Adam Smith stressing its mission is ""environmental rather than social"". Set up in 2013 as a single cafe, it now has sites across the country, including Glasgow and Manchester. It also runs the Kindness Sharehouse in Wakefield, the world's first ""food intercepting"" social supermarket. It has ""intercepted"" 5,000 tonnes of food that would have been waste, the equivalent of 11.9m meals, and inspired more than 120 other concepts around the world. The organisation works with 92 stores to make tonnes of food available on a pay-what-you-can basis. Mr Smith decided to act after witnessing the amount of food waste generated by both farms and restaurant kitchens. ""But the Real Junk Food Project will only be a success when we are no longer needed,"" he says. At ToastLoveCoffee in Leeds, all ingredients are donated from local shops and supermarkets and would have been otherwise wasted. There are no prices on the menu - and skills and time are accepted as currency instead of cash. And in south London, Brixton Pound Cafe uses surplus food to create vegetarian and vegan meals for ""everyone, regardless of situation"". The cafe was opened in July 2016 as a direct response to ""the rampant regeneration of the area"". In 2018 the cafe saved 3.2 tonnes of food from landfill, by serving 11,000 meals to 18,500 customers, and collaborated with 35 local organisations to increase access to affordable healthy food for residents. ""We aim to provide a relaxed and inclusive environment for locals looking for an alternative to expensive, exclusive establishments in Brixton,"" says manager Sean Roy Parker. Back at Eggs & Bread, owner Guy Wilson says: ""What we are basically doing is providing the community with facilities to provide for itself."" At the moment he funds the project and pays staff wages but hopes that within a year it will be self-sustaining. As part of that, the cafe now runs a weekly chilli night where proceeds go towards the breakfast scheme. ""Of course, if the community doesn't want to look after itself, this will fail - but I don't believe it will,"" he adds.",It's a normal morning at a busy north-east London cafe.
"On Monday, the UK suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong over a new security law for the ex-colony, which gives Beijing more power. In response, the Chinese ambassador in London said the UK had ""blatantly interfered"" in China's affairs. Liu Xiaoming said: ""China has never interfered in UK's internal affairs. The UK should do the same to China."" Earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to offer three million Hong Kong residents the chance to settle in the UK, allowing them to ultimately apply for British citizenship. The moves came after Beijing introduced the controversial new security law at the end of June, creating offences that could see Hong Kong residents sent to mainland China for trial. Critics have claimed the law could see pro-democracy protesters in the region being served with life sentences. Tensions between London and Beijing have been rising, with the UK government separately announcing it would require the removal of Chinese technology from the UK's fledgling 5G mobile network. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arrived in London on Monday evening ahead of talks with the PM on issues including China and the coronavirus pandemic. According to its opponents, the new security legislation breaches an agreement made with the UK before Hong Kong - a former British colony - was handed over to China in 1997. Under a 50-year agreement, China enshrined civil liberties - including the right to protest, freedom of speech and the independence of the judiciary - in Hong Kong's Basic Law, an approach which came to be known as ""one country, two systems"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the suspension of the UK's extradition treaty with Hong Kong on Monday, saying there was ""uncertainty"" about how the new security law would be enforced. ""I would just say this: the UK is watching and the whole world is watching,"" he said. The decision means that if someone in the UK is suspected of a crime in Hong Kong, they will not automatically be handed over by British authorities to face justice there. 'Wrong road' Ambassador Liu said in a tweet that the UK had ""contravened international law and the basic norms governing international relations"" with the move. And a statement published on the Chinese Embassy's website said: ""China urges the UK side to immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs, in any form. ""The UK will bear the consequences if it insists on going down the wrong road."" Mr Raab on Sunday accused China of ""gross and egregious"" human rights abuses against a minority group known as the Uighurs, and said sanctions against those responsible cannot be ruled out. The Uighurs are mostly Muslims and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations, and their language is similar to Turkish. The majority live in Xinjiang, western China, where they number about 11 million people. It is believed that the Chinese government has detained up to a million Uighurs over the past few years in what the state defines as ""re-education camps"". The government is now also accused of a programme of forced sterilisation against Uighur women. China initially denied the existence of the camps, before claiming they were a necessary measure against separatist violence in Xinjiang. It also denies carrying out forced sterilisations. But Ambassador Xiaoming denied abuses were taking place and said talk of a concentration camp was ""fake"" after being confronted with drone footage appearing to show Uighurs being blindfolded and led to trains. Last week, the UK government announced it would require the removal of technology manufactured by Chinese company Huawei from the country's fledgling 5G mobile network. That decision followed sanctions imposed by Washington after claims the firm poses a national security threat due to its links with China - something Huawei has denied.","The UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it continues to go ""down the wrong road"" on Hong Kong, China has warned."
"The authority has taken on its legal powers and will be responsible for all planning within the park. The park, which covers 627 square miles across Sussex and Hampshire, was approved on 31 March 2009 and was officially designated a year later. It is more than a decade since the government announced its intention to designate the area as a National Park. Robert Cheesman, who chairs the South Downs Society, said he was looking forward to helping the authority protect a ""very special part of Britain"". 'Long-awaited day' The park stretches from Winchester in Hampshire to Eastbourne in East Sussex, and includes woodland, heathland, downlands and the white chalk cliffs at Beachy Head. The new park authority expects to deal with about 4,000 planning applications a year. Fifteen local authorities will carry out many of the day-to-day planning services, but the park authority will retain overall control.

"Flintshire council's cabinet has voted to axe free transport for pupils attending faith schools. Children will be exempt from the move if they can prove their beliefs with such evidence as baptism certificates. The council has said that withdrawing the discretionary funding could save up to £100,000 a year. Flintshire's cabinet was asked to approve the new home to transport policy for denominational schools on Tuesday. The authority is believed to be one of the first in the UK to impose charges for transporting children who cannot prove they are of the denomination of the school. The charges will apply to new admissions to faith schools from September 2014. The authority is also looking at other ways to cut its £6m school transport bill. Councillors recently agreed to introduce new charges for post-16 students from September as part of its plan to reduce the school transport bill. It said in January that it would continue to honour minimum statutory requirements but now it was reviewing some of the additional discretionary assistance it provided. This included changing its policy on providing free transport to denominational schools, which had been granted irrespective of whether pupils could provide evidence of their faith. The Church in Wales has criticised the proposals saying that a change of policy in the county will disadvantage some families. 'Divided' The council says an increasing number of students are travelling to Cheshire and Lancashire to study so it is also considering providing free transport to specified local places only in a move expected to save about £51,000 a year. The authority held a consultation with parents, schools and and other interested parties. Affected schools were asked to comment, including St Richard Gwyn in Flint, as well as the Catholic diocese of Wrexham. The council received a total of 638 responses, with 542 (85%) strongly disagreeing with the proposals. A report before the cabinet on Tuesday said: ""A high proportion of the responses disagreed with the proposed changes to discretionary entitlement to transport. ""However the reasons for opposition were divided with some opposing all provision of transport to denominational schools - except where they happen to be the nearest school - and those wishing to retain entitlement for all irrespective of their faith.""",Children unable to prove their religious beliefs could lose free bus travel to school after controversial plans were approved by council leaders.
"Jane Riley, chair of the Ipswich Film Theatre Trust said: ""We're still somewhat shocked by it because we've really only known it was going to happen within the last few weeks."" The cinema will close on Friday, 28 October for three weeks. The supermarket said disruption in the Corn Exchange complex was being minimised and the venue did not have to shut. The Corn Exchange, which is owned by the council, includes two cinema screens in the basement which are operated by the volunteer-run trust. Waitrose was granted planning permission last month to take over a bar area above the film theatre. 'Minimise disruption' Ms Riley said: ""Where they've got to put a door in is right behind the projection room and it's going to create too much noise and disruption. ""It was quite clear when the planning application was put in, that the proposals were on the basis that we would not be affected either during the operation of the store or during the building. ""It's turned out not to be true."" A Waitrose spokesperson said: ""We met with the council and the Ipswich Film Trust to develop the construction programme around their showings to minimise disruption to them, however they have taken the decision to close for a short period."" The trust said the film theatre should re-open on Tuesday, 22 November. Waitrose has said its store will open on 1 February 2012.",Ipswich Film Theatre is to close while a new Waitrose store is built.
"Cabinet minister Danny Alexander said it was a ""very disappointing"" result but suggested some supporters had voted for other parties to stop UKIP winning. The party has got less than 5% of the vote in nine by-elections since 2010. Mr Alexander said it was hard for a party in power but its victory in Eastleigh last year proved the Lib Dems could win ""where we are strong"". However, one Lib Dem MP said he was ""baffled"" by his party's efforts in Newark and called for a review of its campaign strategy. The Lib Dems got just over 1,000 votes in Newark, trailing behind the Green Party and an independent candidate, as well as UKIP and Labour, as the Conservatives held onto the seat. 'Strategic review' It was the latest in a string of electoral setbacks for the party, which has seen it reduced to just one seat in the European Parliament and also lose representation on councils across England. The party's share of the vote in Newark, at 2.59%, was one of its lowest in a by-election since 1945 while its vote share was 17% lower than in the 2010 general election. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said this could be partly be explained by people who might have normally voted Lib Dem turning to other parties to stop UKIP getting their first MP. ""Clearly this is a very disappointing result for the Liberal Democrats but it's also clear that an awful lot of our supporters in this by-election voted tactically,"" he said. ""People absolutely didn't want to be represented by UKIP in the House of Commons. I completely understand that."" The Lib Dems have performed poorly in by-elections since they entered government in 2010, although they did retain Eastleigh, the one seat they have defended during that time. Mr Alexander said that victory showed ""in areas where we are strong, where we have parliamentary and local authority strength, we continue to do well in those elections"". 'Squeezed' But John Pugh, Lib Dem MP for Southport, said he had tried to offer his help in the run up to the Newark vote, but found that there was no campaign headquarters in the constituency. He told the BBC that he then received an email in the last few days before polling day, but that the party ""didn't try very hard"". The party's campaigns department, he added, must have a ""review of its strategy"" if the party was to ""recover from a roll of poor results"". In a council by-election earlier this year in Newark, the Lib Dems received fewer votes than a candidate representing the Bus Pass Elvis Party. Nick Clegg's party avoided that fate in Thursday's by-election, with the Bus Pass Elvis party coming ninth but they were only one place ahead of the Loony party. Referring to that moment, the former MP Lembit Opik joked about the party's performance in Newark. ""So, Lib Dems come 6th in Newark by-election, behind Independent & Green, but AHEAD of Nick The Flying Brick (Loony). The revival has begun,"" he wrote on Twitter. He added: ""Nick The Flying Brick (Loony) may dismiss poor result, behind even LDs, as he's never done well in Newark; but I call for Nick's resignation.""",The Liberal Democrats have blamed tactical voting after slumping to sixth place in the Newark by-election.
"Up to 30mm of rain fell overnight, prompting schools to close. Lobleys Drive and the A4173 Stroud Road in Gloucester were both closed and police said cars were becoming stuck near Whaddon and Brookthorpe. BBC weatherman Ian Fergusson warned of strong winds, up to 70mph in some areas, and further rain on Thursday, leading to ""dangerous conditions"". An Environment Agency spokesman said the conditions were ""atrocious"" and more rain was expected. Brooks breached One resident of Haresfield, near Gloucester, described an ""enormous flooding problem"" in the village and said it was ""worse than the flooding in 2007"". Ursula Jeakins said sandbags were urgently needed to offer some protection to houses as the nearby brook had overflowed, drains were blocked and water was running down from Haresfield Beacon. A resident of Armscroft Gardens in Gloucester told the BBC that the nearby brook had breached its banks for the first time since 2007. Charlie Kawczynski said her home had flooded twice five years ago and the levels had not been this high in the brook since then. She said: ""My stomach is in knots, thinking 'here we go again, are we going to have to move out, do we have to find somewhere else to live for six months' and on it goes."" In Leonard Stanley, BBC Radio Gloucestershire reporter Andy Barnard said a church had been saved from flooding by the efforts of four people working to divert the water. He said: ""They have managed to avoid it going into the church by putting trestle tables, rocks and a few boards out."" Elsewhere, Gloucestershire County Council reported that 13 schools were closed because of localised flooding. Train services between Bristol Temple Meads and Gloucester, and between the county and Wales, had been affected. Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service said it responded to some 38 flooding calls, carried out 10 rescues, and was preparing for the possibility of further rain on Thursday. Flood warnings The Environment Agency issued flood warnings for the River Chelt in Charlton Kings, and the River Frome at Brimscombe and Thrupp, as well as at Fromebridge and Eastington. At one point six flood alerts were also in place across the county, including on rivers in North Gloucestershire and the Forest of Dean. The rivers of Frome and Cam were also affected. Earlier, Dave Throup, from the agency, said: ""It has been a story of surface water flooding, with some pretty atrocious conditions on the roads, but the rivers are now beginning to respond. ""The problem is because there is very little evaporation over the winter - temperatures are lower and humidity is higher - it is very unlikely to get better until the spring. ""The soil is pretty likely to stay saturated, so whenever we do get periods of heavy rain it is going to run off very quickly, straight into the rivers, and we are likely to get bouts of flooding like we are seeing now.""","Heavy rain led to ""atrocious"" conditions on roads and caused concern for some residents in Gloucestershire."
"Former Lord Advocate Dame Elish Angiolini has issued the 400-page national cremation investigation. The report was commissioned by the Scottish government. BBC Scotland had revealed in 2013 that no ashes had been offered to the families of infants cremated in Aberdeen over a five-year period. Baby and adult ashes were mixed together and given back to relatives of the adult, while the parents of infants were told there were no ashes. The report concluded: ""The evidence discloses unethical and abhorrent practices at Aberdeen Crematorium over many years, including the cremation of foetuses and babies along with unrelated and unknown adults."" It added: ""The parents of many of the families involved in this investigation have been failed by both crematoria and funeral care organisations over many decades."" New law Lawyers for families involved in the inquiry said the malpractice detailed in report would fill people with ""revulsion"". Aberdeen City Council has apologised. The crematorium at Hazlehead in Aberdeen was among those investigated after it emerged staff at the Mortonhall crematorium in Edinburgh had been burying baby ashes in secret for decades. Parents were told there were no ashes left when young babies were cremated. The practice at the crematorium is thought to have been in place from its opening in 1967 until a change of management in 2011. The report recommends a new law prohibiting the mixing of baby ashes with those of another person. The investigation looked at 14 crematoria and more than 200 cases across Scotland. The report said there was no overall strategic management of the crematorium by Aberdeen City Council, and that the focus among officials was on budget rather than policy. 'Anguish and hurt' It said an Infant Cremation Commission led by Lord Bonomy was misled about practices taking place there. Nicola Merchant, whose son Liam was cremated after he died shortly after being born in 2002, was one of those who did not receive any ashes. She told BBC Scotland of her feelings towards the council: ""They are just a disgrace. ""They do not realise how much hurt they have caused. It's awful."" Aberdeen City Council chief executive Angela Scott said new training practices were in place and the council would look into what else could be done. She said: ""It cannot be overestimated how much anguish and hurt parents have experienced due to past practices at Aberdeen Crematorium. ""On behalf of Aberdeen City Council I apologise unreservedly to those parents who did not receive their baby's ashes, and to the relatives affected by the practice, ended in 2012, of placing baby coffins in the cremator alongside adult coffins. ""The loss of a baby is devastating for parents and their families and we are deeply sorry for the extra distress our past actions have caused."" She added: ""It is important that I restore the public's confidence and trust in the crematorium."" 'Frankly appalling' Public Health Minister Aileen Campbell said: ""No parent should ever have to go through the pain of not knowing what happened to their child's ashes. ""But, sadly, this has not been the case for far too many parents in Scotland. ""Some of the historic practices uncovered in this report are unacceptable and, frankly, appalling. ""It is awful that parents who have lost their child in such sad circumstances have had their grief compounded by the actions of those they trusted to support them. ""While I understand it may be little comfort for those who have been affected in the past, much has changed in Scotland since these issues first came to light."" 'Difficult to believe' She added: ""I want to thank Dame Elish and echo her words in the report that pay tribute to the great courage and dignity that those parents involved have shown through their participation."" Patrick McGuire, of Thompsons Solicitors, said: ""Dame Elish has produced an in depth and authoritative report into terrible practices at crematoria throughout Scotland. ""What she has uncovered about the Hazlehead crematorium in Aberdeen will fill any right thinking person with revulsion. ""I find it difficult to believe that the horror of what was going on at Hazlehead was unknown to council officials.""","""Unethical and abhorrent practices"", including babies being cremated with unrelated adults, went on in Aberdeen for many years, a report has revealed."
"Kingsley Burrell, 29, was detained under the Mental Health Act on 27 March after officers attended an incident in Icknield Port Road, Birmingham. He was admitted to a unit in the city and later moved to a hospital where he died four days later, police said. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating. Mr Burrell's sister Kadisha Brown Burrell, who will be at the march, told BBC News that they did not know how he died. 'Heartfelt bereavement' ""We have never been told what the cause of death is,"" she said. ""We have been told the [IPCC] investigation will take about six months and we get updates from the coroner but the inquest has not happened yet."" In a statement issued shortly after Mr Burrell's death, police said that three days after he was detained under the Mental Health Act officers were called to support medical staff at a mental health unit following reports of a disturbance. Mr Burrell was transferred to hospital but died the following day, the statement said. Ms Brown Burrell said she expected about 2,000 people to attend the march, which started in Abbey Road, Hockley, at about 1200 BST. ""It's to demonstrate the heartfelt bereavement the whole family and community have been suffering since my brother's tragic death.

"By Nick DermodyBBC Wales News Bluestone in Pembrokeshire and Ffos Las racecourse in Carmarthenshire are to plant 60-acre Diamond Woods. But Coed Cadw, the Woodland Trust in Wales, also wants ministers to strengthen power to preserve and list existing ""gnarled and wrinkly"" trees. The Welsh government is consulting on a planned new environmental body. The 60th anniversary of the Queen's accession is being marked by the creation of 60 commemorative woodlands across the UK, including two in Wales. Bluestone National Park Resort is to plant 35,000 trees at its 500-acre estate near Canaston Bridge, Pembrokeshire. Work is also under way at Ffos Las racecourse, Trimsaran for the planting of around 45,000 young trees, mostly birch, ash and rowan. The Woodland Trust says its separate Jubilee Woods project is set to provide more than 50,000 saplings to be planted by more than 800 schools in Wales. But it wants the planned new single environmental body to draw up a database of trees whose heritage already stretches back hundreds or thousands of years. The charity said the Welsh government's decision to replace the Environment Agency, Countryside Council and Forestry Commission in Wales with a single organisation was an opportunity to boost protection for hundreds of rare and ancient trees. It has launched a petition calling for Wales' new environmental body to have a duty to help - with cash where necessary - people who have ancient, veteran and heritage trees to look after. It also says Tree Preservation Order rules need to be made ""fully fit for purpose"" with ""meaningful"" fines for developers who cut down rare or ancient trees for valuable building land. Rory Francis, of Coed Cadw, said castles and listed buildings had more protection than many trees that were hundreds if not thousands of years old. He said: ""If you owned and important building that was listed, you wouldn't be able to change it or knock it down without permission, but you would be able to access funds to carry out necessary changes. ""There simply isn't anything like that for trees. ""With the powers of the three organisations coming together, this presents an opportunity to have the conservation of ancient trees and the assistance and service of their owners as one of the functions of the new body."" 'Protecting diversity' Mr Francis said the law allowing open-ended fines for people who chop down a tree in contravention of a preservation order was rarely used, with most prosecutions taking place under regulations that imposed a maximum fine of only £2,500. He said this needed to be changed to protect old and often isolated trees that find themselves in the way of a ruthless developer. He said: ""If, in cutting down a tree or trees, a landowner has managed to free up a building plot that was worth millions, it should be possible for a meaningful fine to be imposed. It should be up to the court."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The Welsh government's forestry policy is set out in Woodlands for Wales and emphasises the importance of both protecting the diversity of woodlands in Wales and increasing the overall amount of woodland. ""We will expect the single body to carry forward these policies once it comes into being and we will consider the points raised by Coed Cadw and others as we develop our final legislative proposals.""","As two new woods are created in Wales for the Diamond Jubilee, conservationists say more needs to be done to protect its most ancient trees."
"By Trystan JonesBBC News The Somme, in northern France, was not only one of the bloodiest battles of World War One, but one of the bloodiest in history. More than 1.2 million men are believed to have been killed or injured during the main battle but below ground a group of soldiers, including Sapper Lloyd, fought their own private, hidden war. Sapper Lloyd's family, back home near Wrexham, knew little about what happened to him, other than he was killed by a German mine. His great granddaughter Lesley Woodbridge, of Telford, Shropshire, spent seven years investigating his death. On Sunday, with the help of a team of archaeologists studying the La Boisselle tunnels below the Somme, she descended 80ft (24m) and crawled along tunnels that in all likelihood her great grandfather had helped dig. ""We've just made the very last journey that he ever made and now we're standing where he actually rests. That has to be emotional,"" she said. ""I never even thought I would even find out what part of France he was in, so to be standing here, just a few metres away from him, is just incredible."" 'Historical first' Ms Woodbridge, 59, said it marked the end of what at times felt like a futile search for her relative. But it is also a historical first, according to Peter Barton, who led the group studying the network of tunnels at La Boisselle. ""This is hugely significant. I've just shivered thinking about it, because this is the first time ever that a relative has been able to visit these places,"" he said. ""You can't do that for men on the surface, who are lost in battle, because you simply don't know where they are. ""But of course in the tunnel wars it was so constrained and constricted and so well documented, we know exactly what happened, at what time and what the results were."" Sapper Lloyd was a miner from New Broughton in north Wales, who joined the 179th Tunnelling Company in 1915. In October of that year he was sent to the Somme, only to die six weeks later in a German explosion far below No Man's Land. Aged 37, he left behind a wife and six children. 'An obsession' Ms Woodbridge said he had time to write one letter back home, although he was not allowed to explain what he was doing, nor where he was. In a section of it, he wrote: ""Dear wife, children and mother, just two or three lines to let you know that I am quite well. ""All I can tell you is I wish the war was over. It's a monstrous one. I am still thinking of home, the weather here is awful and cold. ""Wishing you all a merry Christmas, but I shan't be home for it. From your husband William Arthur."" Sapper Lloyd was not to see Christmas. The family received a letter confirming his death, but little else. Almost a century later, Ms Woodbridge said the search for her great grandfather had developed into an ""obsession"". ""You can spend so much time looking, just trawling through information and finding nothing and getting really fed up with yourself and then suddenly you find something and it's just such a great feeling. ""I just wish my grandmother and other members of the family were still around so they could see the results."" One member who is still alive, but not able to make the trip herself, is Lesley's 88-year-old mother Thelma Roberts, who still lives in Wrexham. She broke down in tears as her daughter made her way along the tunnel and spoke to her on the phone. Ms Woodbridge's hunt began in 2005. Searching online she discovered that Sapper Lloyd was named on the Thiepval Memorial, among some 70,000 men lost at the Somme. However, her enquiries were proving fruitless until she got in contact with Simon Jones at the University of Birmingham. An expert on WW1 tunnelling, Mr Jones was also connected with the archaeological dig at La Boisselle. Mr Jones quickly confirmed that Sapper Lloyd was one of five men who died in a counter-tunnelling operation. 'Hidden battlefield' Members of what became the La Boisselle Study Group were invited, by the landowners, to investigate the site two years ago. ""There was a little hole in the field and we slipped into the hole and it opened up into this labyrinth of tunnels,"" Mr Barton said. ""We found that rather than being completely destroyed they were very well preserved."" Today, the team can access almost four miles of tunnels, on four levels, beneath what is just a five acre site. Among those now accessible is W1 shaft, where, in a small gallery, Sapper Lloyd died. ""It's a sobering experience, because they're not just tunnels, but a hidden battlefield,"" Mr Barton said. ""We have a perception of a World War One battlefield, but this is an underground, private, clandestine war and William Arthur was a part of it."" Using documents from the British, French and German archives, the study group was able to piece together what happened. In one German report on 23 December 1915, a deputy company commander wrote that a microphone first detected British miners working nearby on 18 December. A 750kg explosive charge was detonated immediately, presumably killing one group of miners. The company then started to prepare a 12,000kg charge. Oberleutnant Sihler wrote: ""After six and a half hours' work, the charge had been laid in the mine chamber, and by 12:30 tamping and timbering had been completed and the mine was ready to be fired."" It was detonated at 16:00, killing Sapper Lloyd and his fellow miners. Despite its depth, it created a crater 40m wide on the surface. The war underground has gone largely unrecognised, while history has focused on men pouring over the tops of trenches into a hail of bullets and artillery shell explosions. The La Boisselle Study Group hopes to remedy that, although there are no plans to open up the gallery that is now a grave for Sapper Lloyd and his four colleagues. For Ms Woodbridge, the group has given her a unique insight into her great grandfather's brief war and death almost 100 years ago. Down in the tunnels she left behind an urn containing soil from the colliery where her great grandfather first worked - ""a little bit of home for him"". ""This is the end of the journey for me. There's nowhere else I can go is there?"" she added. ""I can't get any closer to him.""",Sapper William Arthur Lloyd was killed by a German mine while tunnelling below the Somme battlefield in 1915. Now his great granddaughter has retraced his steps to stand just feet from where he died - and where his body still lies.
"Downing Street said the PM had ""lost confidence in his ability to serve"" and Penny Mordaunt will take on the role. The inquiry followed reports over a plan to allow Huawei limited access to help build the UK's new 5G network. Mr Williamson, who has been defence secretary since 2017, ""strenuously"" denies leaking the information. In a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Theresa May told him she had information that provided ""compelling evidence"" that he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure. In a letter confirming his dismissal, she said: ""No other, credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified."" Responding in a letter to the PM, Mr Williamson said he was ""confident"" that a ""thorough and formal inquiry"" would have ""vindicated"" his position. ""I appreciate you offering me the option to resign, but to resign would have been to accept that I, my civil servants, my military advisers or my staff were responsible: this was not the case,"" he said. The inquiry into the National Security Council leak began after the Daily Telegraph reported on the Huawei decision and subsequent warnings within cabinet about possible risks to national security over a deal with Huawei. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said sources close to the former defence secretary had told her Mr Williamson did meet the Daily Telegraph's deputy political editor, Steven Swinford, but, she pointed out ""that absolutely does not prove"" he leaked the story to him. According to Sky News defence and security correspondent Alistair Bunkall, Mr Williamson swore on his children's lives that he was not responsible for the leak. Security correspondent Frank Gardner said the BBC had been told ""more than one concerning issue"" had been uncovered regarding Mr Williamson during the leak inquiry and not just the Huawei conversation. Downing Street has made a very serious accusation and is sure enough to carry out this sacking. For the prime minister's allies, it will show that she is, despite the political turmoil, still strong enough to move some of her ministers around - to hire and fire. Mr Williamson is strenuously still denying that the leak was anything to do with him at all. There is nothing fond, or anything conciliatory, in either the letter from the prime minister to him, or his reply back to her. Read more from Laura The National Security Council (NSC) is made up of senior cabinet ministers and its weekly meetings are chaired by the prime minister, with other ministers, officials and senior figures from the armed forces and intelligence agencies invited when needed. It is a forum where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5 with ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. There has been no formal confirmation of Huawei's role in the 5G network and No 10 said a final decision would be made at the end of spring. Huawei has denied there is any risk of spying or sabotage, or that it is controlled by the Chinese government. Mrs May said the leak from the meeting on 23 April was ""an extremely serious matter and a deeply disappointing one"". Theresa May's letter to Gavin Williamson It is vital for the operation of good government and for the UK's national interest in some of the most sensitive and important areas that the members of the NSC - from our armed forces, our security and intelligence agencies, and the most senior level of government - are able to have frank and detailed discussions in full confidence that the advice and analysis provided is not discussed or divulged beyond that trusted environment. ""That is why I commissioned the cabinet secretary to establish an investigation into the unprecedented leak from the NSC meeting last week, and why I expected everyone connected to it - ministers and officials alike - to comply with it fully. You undertook to do so. ""I am therefore concerned by the manner in which you have engaged with this investigation."" Read the rest of the letter in full Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the prime minister had no alternative but to sack Mr Williamson, but he said on a personal level he was ""very sorry about what happened"". When asked whether there should be a criminal inquiry into the NSC leak, new defence secretary Ms Mordaunt said: ""The prime minister has made her decision. ""What I'm focused on is getting on with the job."" Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has called for a police inquiry to investigate whether or not Mr Williamson breached the Official Secrets Act. That sentiment was echoed by former national security adviser Lord Ricketts. He told BBC Newsnight that on the face of it, the leak was a breach of the official secrets act and therefore the police ought to be considering an inquiry. Lib Dems leader Vince Cable said Mr Williamson's sacking was ""absolutely extraordinary"" and the PM did it in ""such a forthright way"". He added that he believed it was ""clearly a police matter"". His deputy, Jo Swinson, has asked the police to open an investigation. But Scotland Yard said in a statement that it was a matter for the National Security Council and the Cabinet Office, and it was not carrying out an investigation. Defence Committee chairman Julian Lewis told the BBC that Mr Williamson's sacking was a ""loss"" when looked at ""purely"" from the point of view of defence. He said he thought ""very highly"" of Ms Mordaunt - the first woman to take the role of defence secretary. Rory Stewart has been confirmed as the new international development secretary, taking over from Ms Mordaunt. Mr Stewart said he believed the prime minister and national security adviser had ""made the right decision"" in sacking Mr Williamson.",Gavin Williamson has been sacked as defence secretary following an inquiry into a leak from a top-level National Security Council meeting.

"The effect of storms on ageing trains meant a third of the fleet of 127 on Wales' rail network were put out of action earlier this month. But after a ""mammoth"" push to repair them, operator Transport for Wales said services are set to return to normal. Chief executive James Price said it was looking into what had gone wrong. Transport for Wales (TfW)'s contractor Keolis-Amey took over the Wales and Borders service from Arriva in October but within weeks it was faced with cancelling a number of services. But on Friday it said ""the picture is expected to improve over the next two weeks, starting on Monday when services on the Wrexham-Bidston line will be restored to normal. ""After unprecedented levels of damage to trains caused disruption across the network, Transport for Wales engineers have worked almost 1,000 hours of overtime over the last four weeks to return damaged trains to the tracks,"" it said in a statement. ""The number of available trains in the fleet has increased by more than 10% in the last four days after the mammoth engineering push, and the number of trains reporting new faults is starting to fall. ""While the current stormy conditions are still creating difficult conditions for rail services, the picture is still expected to improve."" 'Prevent it happening again' Network Rail and Transport for Wales have launched a joint investigation to understand why this autumn's weather caused so much damage to the fleet. TfW said an £800m investment in new trains meant services would be better able to cope with autumn weather conditions. The first trains will be introduced in north Wales as early as next year. Mr Price said: ""Our main focus now is on understanding what went wrong, and doing everything in our power to prevent it happening again."" On Thursday, he said the fleet had not been maintained ""quite as well as it could have been"" before the new franchise started. But former operator Arriva defended itself against criticism of its maintenance record on Friday, saying it it went ""above and beyond"" in its contractual obligations.","Passengers who have faced disruption after an ""unprecedented"" number of trains were damaged have been told that things will start to improve next week."

Read more news for Birmingham and the Black Country The breast surgeon, of Castle Mill Lane, Ashley, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, was employed by Heart of England NHS Trust and also practised at Spire Healthcare. He said the mastectomy on Dr Platt ""was carried out to prevent cancer, not to treat it"".

"Isaiah Haastrup is brain damaged and dependent on a ventilator to keep him alive at King's College Hospital, London. Doctors said giving him further treatment was ""futile, burdensome and not in his best interests"". But father Lanre Haastrup and mother Takesha Thomas want it to continue. They also hope an independent assessor will be appointed to give a medical opinion. Isaiah was born with a severe brain injury believed to have been caused by oxygen deprivation. Doctors do not think there are any ""further investigations or forms of treatment"" which would benefit him, the hospital's barrister Fiona Paterson said. She told Mr Justice MacDonald relations between hospital bosses and Isaiah's parents were ""difficult"". The court heard that Mr Haastrup, of Peckham, south London, had been barred from visiting the hospital following an incident a few days ago. 'Not a saint' Mr Haastrup sought a judicial review over the ban which has been refused by the High Court. ""I am not a saint but I am not a demon either,"" he said. He told the court there had been a ""lack of care"" for Isaiah. Mr Justice MacDonald created an order barring the media from identifying medical staff caring for Isaiah and said he hoped mediation could avoid a full trial. Failing that, the court case will formally begin on 15 January.

"By Iolo ap DafyddBBC Wales environment correspondent They believe ministers are placing too much emphasis on the environment at the expense of trees grown for timber. Britain is currently the world's third largest importer of wood. Ministers said they were encouraging commercial forestry organisations to invest in woodland creation. Conifer forests have been a familiar sight for half a century in Wales and have helped the timber industry grow. But Confor, which promotes the forestry industry, warns that at least 16,000 hectares - or 40,000 acres - of commercial forest have been lost since 2001 and need to be re-planted to meet needs. Half of the woodland is managed by Natural Resources Wales with the the other half by private companies. As an industry, it is estimated to be worth more than £450m a year to the Welsh economy. But there is a conflict with environmental policy. Successive ministers have wanted more native, broadleaf species of trees and better access for walkers and bike riders while conservationists claim commercial forests are bad for wildlife. However, some forests in Wales are difficult to reach and hard to harvest while transporting the timber through rural communities can bring companies into conflict with local residents. The Welsh government wants a balance between the environmental, the economic and the social in how forestry is developed. It points to its Glastir scheme which encourages farmers and other landowners to plant woodland. It said its Woodlands for Wales forestry strategy ""sets out how we want Wales to be known for its high quality woodlands that enhance the landscape, provide real social and community benefits, support thriving woodland-based industries and contribute to a better quality environment"". Martin Bishop, of Confor, which represents 200 businesses in Wales, believes the emphasis on environmental aspects is seen as ""sexier"" than commercial forestry. He said the current system is also too bureaucratic for creating new woodland areas. Mr Bishop said 90 hectares were planted last year but there needed to be 20,000 hectares a year to meet long-term targets set by ministers. ""There's a huge market for our timber. Every saw miller tells me he would double or treble production if the timber was there to feed that mill,"" he added.","Woodland bigger than the size of Cardiff needs to be re-planted in Wales to make up for commercial forestry lost over the past 15 years, industry experts have warned."
"Keegan Doyle, 23, of Broughton, Flintshire, was jailed for three years and eight months after admitting causing serious injury by dangerous driving and arson at Mold Crown Court. Doyle struck ten-year-old Alfie Watts who was riding his bike in Saltney, near Chester, on 6 January. Judge Niclas Parry said Alfie's life was ""changed irreversibly"". Alfie was rushed with a police escort to Liverpool's Alder Hey children's hospital ""fighting for his life"" after suffering a fractured skull and brain injury. Prosecuting Sion ap Mihangel said Doyle had been the getaway driver for a fleeing shoplifter. Doyle ""drove like an idiot"" at up to 60mph in a 30mph zone, the court was told. Alfie and a friend were returning from playing football in a park when he was knocked over on Park Avenue, colliding with the windscreen of the Ford Fiesta. The court heard in a statement from his mother Zoe Grundy how she ran to the scene and held her son's hand. ""It was heartbreaking to see my son lying in such pain,"" she said. Judge Parry said Doyle did not brake or slow and described his failure to stop at the scene of the accident as ""cowardly, selfish and disgraceful behaviour"". Doyle then tried to destroy the car by leaving a burning rag in the petrol tank but was caught after leaving his wallet, with his picture and name inside, by the car. Defending, Robin Boag, said Doyle had no previous convictions. He added: ""He can't turn back the clock. If he could, he would do so."" Doyle was also banned from driving for four years and ten months and must take a re-test. Judge Parry said: ""On January 6 the life of a bright, active, happy ten-year-old boy was changed irreversibly."" He awarded £500 to passer-by Amy Fernandez for giving assistance which possibly saved Alfie's life. In a statement, Alfie's family thanked those people who helped save his life. They added: ""We have been overwhelmed with the love and kindness that has been shown."" A 28-year-old woman who was also arrested in connection with the incident will appear before Mold Crown Court on 22 March.","A ""cowardly"" hit-and-run getaway driver who left a boy with a severe brain injury has been jailed."
"Mr Salmond is due to give evidence to the Holyrood inquiry into the government's mishandling of harassment complaints against him later this week. He says he has ""documentary evidence"" of a ""malicious and concerted"" attempt to remove him from public life. But the first minister said any claims of a conspiracy were ""not true"". And she said Mr Salmond had an ""obligation"" to ""replace the insinuation and assertion we have heard over several months now with evidence"". The Holyrood inquiry was established after the government conceded an internal investigation of two harassment complaints against the former first minister had been ""unlawful"". He was awarded more than £500,000 in legal expenses following the judicial review case, and was subsequently acquitted of charges of sexual assault in a separate High Court trial. In a written submission published on Monday, Mr Salmond said there had been ""a deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort amongst a range of individuals within the Scottish government and the SNP to damage my reputation, even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". He said the government and SNP ""felt threatened"" by the judicial review case, and said he had ""documentary evidence"" that there was a ""fishing expedition to recruit potential complainants"". In other letters to the inquiry he has described the behaviour of the government as a ""disgrace"", accusing it of concealing key evidence from his legal team and of leaking information to the media to damage him. He has also accused Ms Sturgeon of ""repeatedly"" misleading parliament over her meetings with him, making statements which are ""simply untrue"", and of breaking the ministerial code. Mr Salmond is to give evidence to the inquiry on Wednesday, with Ms Sturgeon expected to face MSPs the following week. The first minister said she hoped Mr Salmond would ""turn up to the committee and bring the claims he has been making out into the open"". She said: ""He appears to be suggesting some kind of conspiracy or concerted campaign against him, without a shred of evidence. ""This is his opportunity - because the burden of proof of that lies on him, to replace the insinuation and assertion we have heard over several months now with evidence. ""I don't believe he can do that, because I know what he is claiming about a conspiracy is not true. ""If he can't substantiate it, it's time for him to stop making these claims - because it's not fair to women first and foremost who came forward with complaints, or the other people who have given years of loyal service to Alex Salmond who he appears to be directing those claims to."" In an interview with BBC Scotland, the first minister said she would ""stand by what I said in parliament"" about her meetings with Mr Salmond, saying she would ""relish the opportunity"" to go into detail. She said: ""I will set out what I knew and I will set out my recollection of all these things, and answer questions for as long as the committee wants to hear about that. ""This is a situation where I and others were faced with a really difficult scenario - allegations against someone I had been very close to. I dealt with that to the best of my ability and I think I made the right judgements overall."" Ms Sturgeon said the government ""did make a mistake in the application of its procedure"" for handling complaints, and said it would ""reflect on the lessons of that"". But she insisted the new policy had been drawn up in response to ""the global MeToo movement"", not Mr Salmond. This echoes evidence given to the committee by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans - Scotland's top civil servant - who told MSPs that the government was not out to ""get Alex Salmond"". Ms Sturgeon said she still had full confidence in Ms Evans, and that she expected her to remain in post for the duration of her current contract.","Nicola Sturgeon has challenged Alex Salmond to prove there was a conspiracy against him, saying he has made claims ""without a shred of evidence""."
"The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is looking into the crash at Henllan Amgoed - the Llanboidy crossing - just before 16:00 BST on Friday. Initially there were reports of three injuries on the Arriva Trains service. But British Transport Police said later there were no reported injuries after the ""glancing blow"" to the 15:10 BST Milford Haven to Manchester train. A similar incident happened at the same level crossing in December 2011 when a passenger train was involved in a crash with a lorry and trailer carrying hay. A BTP spokesman said Friday's incident involved a small lorry. He added: ""Colleagues from Dyfed-Powys Police, the Welsh Ambulance Service and Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service also attended. ""The train remained upright and on the tracks following the collision. ""It is believed there were around 30 passengers on the train, but no injuries were reported."" The B4328 road was closed while investigations were carried out. The fire service said via Twitter that passengers were transferred onto buses to Carmarthen station. One passenger said: ""There wasn't really much of a sound. It was more... of a very slight judder. ""It wasn't really much different to what you feel normally on a track.""","An investigation is under way after a lorry and a train collided at a level crossing at Whitland, Carmarthenshire."
"Cleveland Police does not have ""sufficient capacity"" for contracted-out staff coming back ""in-house"". A report from the police and crime commissioner's (PCC) office revealed £1.75m had been set aside to buy and fit-out the offices. PCC Barry Coppinger said the hub was designed before the decision was made not to renew the services contract. The newly-purchased St Mark's House at Teesdale Business Park, Stockton, was ""excellent value for money"", he said. It would allow the force to ""meet an increased need for space as force numbers begin to grow"", he added. The decision was made in 2018 not to renew a 10-year services contact which saw about 470 staff transferred to services firm Sopra Steria. Staff are due to come back in-house in October, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Accommodation is needed for 100 of these workers along with 60 to 80 new staff. Cleveland Police moved out of its 1970s office block on Ladgate Lane in 2018 due to increasing running costs. Mr Coppinger announced he would not stand for re-election after the force became the first in the UK to be rated inadequate in all areas last year.

"The Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare plans to put its concerns to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) in the new year. ""People are stealing dogs with a criminal element coming into it,"" said group chairman Neil Parish. Animal welfare groups say thefts are on the increase. Mr Parish believes more action is needed to reduce the number of pets being taken. 'Emotional attachment' ""I think government is becoming aware of it but probably needs to become much more aware of it. The government have got to make sure that the public are also much more aware of it,"" he said. Criminologists from Loughborough University have been analysing figures from the Dog Lost website - an organisation which, over the past 10 years, has helped to reunite more than 30,000 missing dogs with their owners. BBC 5 Live Investigates has been given access to research that analysed 7,262 dogs listed on the Dog Lost site as being either lost or reunited between September 2011 and August 2012. Of those, 457 were identified as being stolen during that period. The research found that 49% had been taken from gardens, with 13% taken from people's homes. However, the Dog Lost organisation said the numbers being snatched could be even higher. ""Quite often a dog is perhaps perceived as just being missing and it's only after it's been missing for a while that an owner actually finds out it's been stolen,"" said Dog Lost's Nik Oakley. ""We also need an effective way of reporting this and one central place where that data is collected."" One woman from West Yorkshire told the programme she had her pet stolen by a man who broke into her home earlier this month. The man threatened her with a knife before stealing her two-year-old French bulldog. Rewards Another pet owner, Blazej from London, put up a £1,000 reward after his two Chihuahua puppies were stolen from his car in December. He was soon contacted by two men who said they had his pets. ""Initially they said to me they unwittingly bought the dogs for £200 each. They demanded £1,400 for them. ""But then in other phone calls they started to indicate it was them who stole the dogs. They were laughing at me saying they would sell them over to Holland. ""We are totally saddened. It's not like a material loss - this is a living creature that you have an emotional attachment to,"" said Blazej. The figures collated by Loughborough University found that rewards were offered for around 42% of the dogs taken. But Dog Lost warns that specifying certain amounts for rewards could lead thieves to take advantage of owners searching for their missing pets. ""If you put a price on it, then that reward is always negotiable upwards because thieves know that people are desperate to get their dogs back,"" said Ms Oakley. In the new year, the parliamentary group is set to invite Defra to hear evidence from people who have had direct experience of having their dog stolen to discuss possible solutions. A Defra spokesperson said: ""Lost and stolen dogs cost taxpayers and welfare charities £57m every year. We are combating this problem by bringing in compulsory microchipping by 2016. This will make lost or stolen dogs easier to trace and gives owners peace of mind."" 5live Investigates is broadcast on BBC Radio 5live on Sunday, 22 December at 11:00 GMT.",MPs and peers are urging the government to do more to tackle organised dog theft.
"By Iain McDowellBBC News NI Zipping up a thick jacket and pulling on a pair of gloves, Mohammed is ready for a hard day's graft. He is one of a number of refugees and asylum seekers living in Belfast who spend their spare time doing voluntary conservation and preservation work in the Mourne mountains in County Down. In Algeria, his home country, he was a police officer, but ""problems with my government and a terrorist group"" forced him to flee. He has been in Northern Ireland for 18 months now - it is his ""new home"". These mountains are where Mohammed and others displaced from their homelands come regularly to find peace. Generations They are working with the Mourne Heritage Trust, which looks after this area of outstanding natural beauty, to rebuild dry-stone walls and repair mountain paths. The walls are one of the most unmistakable features of the Mournes, with hundreds of miles stretching over mountain peaks, dividing land and providing shelter for livestock and other wildlife. The skills to build them - patience, an eye for a good stone, and a strong back, among other things - have been passed down through generations. And now these refugees are learning them, too. For Mohammed, this is his first time working on the walls: ""I think it's very good experience for me."" Anxieties With about 100 Syrian refugees expected to arrive in Northern Ireland before Christmas, the volunteer scheme could soon play a bigger role in offering a tranquil retreat to more people who have left conflict-hit countries. Mediation Northern Ireland is one of the charities helping refugees and asylum seekers to settle into their new lives. Mary McAnulty from the organisation says it works closely with the Mourne Heritage Trust. The intention has been to help the refugees to make new friends, improve their language skills and explore part the country they now call home. ""Lots of people suffer from anxieties, so having a day out of Belfast is great,"" Mary says. ""If your world is very small, just the area you live in, then these can be your hills. ""I love to see people becoming proud of it and feeling that they have a sense of place."" Indebted Amar, who has moved to Belfast with his family from Sudan, says getting outside the city ""is good for me"". And for Elizabeth, who is Colombian, the fresh countryside air is ""good for my mind"". But it is not just a one-way thing. Large areas of walls have become damaged due to erosion and increasing visitor numbers, and the Mourne Heritage Trust relies on volunteers to do the repair work. Ranger John McEvoy says the trust is indebted to the refugees. Smile ""They're willing to get the sleeves rolled up, get stuck into it,"" he explains. ""As the day goes on, you'll see them lifting the stone, doing exactly as we're doing."" And Dean Fitzpatrick, a Mourne man who comes from a family of stoneworkers, says you do not have to be born and bred in the shadow of the mountains to chip in. ""There are boys here who aren't stonemasons at all, from all different parts of the world,"" he says. ""They're doing as good as anybody and they've only been here an hour or two."" As Mohammed removes his gloves and wipes his brow after the work is done, his smile is wide. ""Here it's very quiet - everything is perfect for me here.""","""I'm here to help my new friends to build a big wall, like the Chinese wall."""
"In a speech made after a UN resolution calling for action against so-called Islamic State was approved, he said Labour would support ""every necessary measure"" to protect people in the UK. But it was ""vital"" in a time of tragedy ""not to be drawn into responses that feed a cycle of violence"", he said. Meanwhile, David Cameron wants to build support for air strikes on IS in Syria. The militant group - also referred to as Isil and Isis - has said it carried out the attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. There is no timetable for a Parliamentary vote on UK military action in Syria, although the UK does carry out air strikes against IS in Iraq. PM to meet Hollande in wake of attacks Paris-style attack fear prompts Belgium alert Latest updates: Brussels on high alert ""The dreadful Paris attacks make the case for a far more urgent effort to reach a negotiated settlement of the civil war in Syria and the end to the threat from Isis,"" Mr Corbyn said. ""It is the conflict in Syria and the consequences of the Iraq war which have created the conditions for Isis to thrive and spread its murderous rule. ""Everyone, including Muslims in Britain, wants to see the defeat of the murderous and reactionary cult of Isil."" Mr Corbyn opposes UK forces joining allied air strikes against IS strongholds in Syria, but is under pressure to allow his MPs a free vote on the issue. He said action against IS ""that sticks on the ground, destroys the virus and reclaims the hearts and minds"" will have to come from the ""Arab and Muslim world"" and could not be seen to be an external intervention. Mr Corbyn said: ""That is why we should use the UN Security Council resolution passed last night to accelerate moves towards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict."" The UN resolution, co-sponsored by the UK, calls on nations to ""redouble and co-ordinate their efforts to prevent and suppress terrorist attacks"" using all necessary measures. It received universal approval on Friday night. 'Three pillars' The prime minister said the vote ""shows beyond doubt the breadth of international support"" to ""eradicate"" IS. Mr Corbyn told the BBC the UN had backed ""general action"" against IS, including political and diplomatic responses, which he welcomed. It does not specifically say military action, he said. But he said: ""Labour will always stand up to any threat to this country and the people of this country. ""We're not going to leave British people or this country unprotected, but we do need a different approach to foreign policy."" This new approach was one of Mr Corbyn's ""three pillars"" that he set out in his wide-ranging speech. He also said he wanted a new form of politics that gave people a say in decision-making and he said he wanted Labour to be an anti-austerity party that provided prosperity for all. He went on to warn that ministers would be ""gambling with the safety of the British people"" if they made cuts to police budgets. The Spending Review could include a police budget cut of more than 20%. Chancellor George Osborne is set to announce the government's spending plans in Parliament on Wednesday.","People ""must not keep making the same mistakes"" when responding to acts of terror, Jeremy Corbyn has warned."
"Mr Brown has been the Interim Commissioner since July when Sir Peter Hendy left to take up the position of chairman of Network Rail. Mr Brown said he was honoured to be appointed into the role following an international recruitment process. The mayor of London said Mr Brown was the ""right person"" to lead the growth of the capital's transport network. Mr Brown, who was was previously TfL's managing director of London Underground and Rail, said: ""London's transport networks have been modernised and customer service transformed in recent years, enabling us to carry more people, more safely and reliably than ever before."" He added his priorities as commissioner included continuing to modernise and upgrade the Tube, as well as the delivery of Crossrail and Crossrail 2. Transport for London said the new commissioner would receive a salary of £355,944, the same as the previous Commissioner, in 2015/16. Mr Brown will also be eligible for a performance award each year of up to 50% of his salary. London Assembly Green Party member Jenny Jones criticised the mayor for not reducing the new commissioner's pay. She said: ""The mayor has missed a golden opportunity to ratchet down top pay at TfL. ""The police commissioner is paid £290,000, so paying the TfL commissioner more than £500,000 doesn't look fair or necessary.""",Mike Brown has been appointed the new commissioner of Transport for London (TfL).
"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter They will have their celebrations tonight - deservedly so. Corbyn has achieved a rarity in modern politics - expanding an electorate. Persuade more people who agree with you to take part, and you can win, however out of fashion those ideas are. But now installed, there are problems everywhere for Labour's new leader. He has always been an outsider, an insurgent in his own party. How can he expect loyalty from his colleagues, unite the party, when he has rarely displayed it himself? MPs have been discussing ousting him for weeks. There will likely be initial faint support from most. Don't expect a rapid coup. But don't doubt most smiles behind him at the despatch box will be through gritted teeth. And shadow ministers' resignation letters have already been written. It won't be easy for him to build a team robust enough to function in Westminster's brutal world. And wise Labour heads worry it's inevitable the party will return to a fight it's had before - moderates battling to squeeze out the left. His opponents outside the party won't let him forget his past associations - reaching out to Irish Republicans and vocal opponents of Israel - peacemaking in his view, unacceptable to others. That, combined with his economic views, out of step with the mainstream, means for most Conservatives his success is a political gift. They believe his election is a chance, not just to poke fun week after week, at an accidental leader, but to maim Labour for a generation. And his election expresses a fundamental truth - the least palatable for Labour at Westminster. The party's core was unable to offer an idea, or a personality attractive enough to inspire or convince. What was, for them, an uncomfortable fantasy is now real. But the biggest gamble is this: Corbyn won against all the odds by stitching together old voices, new activists and union support. That was enough to win the party's own election. Could that powerful niche ever expand to become a true national movement capable of winning a general election? That really would be breaking the rules.","He, and they, did it. Now what? Jeremy Corbyn's victory was not the work of Labour MPs, power brokers, or the party's once powerful machine, but the flex of an old muscle - Labour's left-wing rump - once so weakened, now strong, emboldened by thousands upon thousands of new supporters."
"Fort Paull, a gun battery and fort on the north bank of the Humber Estuary, was a museum before closing in January. Bids for the last surviving Blackburn Beverley Transporter Aircraft currently stand at more than £3,000. A pretend skeleton and a waxwork of the Queen are among the eclectic items up for grabs until 19 September. Auctioneer Andrew Baitson said: ""It's certainly up there with one of more unusual lots we've had."" Mr Baitson said there had been ""quite a lot of interest"" in the Blackburn Beverley, which was one of 49 built in the 1950s in Brough, near Hull. When it entered service, it was the largest aircraft in the RAF and could carry more than 100 troops and a range of military vehicles. He added: ""This is a chance to own a real piece of history and would be one hell of a man cave. ""We've had interest from museums and aviation enthusiasts so hopefully it will be saved rather than being sold off for scrap."" Fort Paull was built in 1861 to defend the approach to the important port at Kingston-upon-Hull. Later, it was a strategic base for Charles 1 during the English Civil War and was used as an ammunition store during World War Two. It opened to the public as a museum in 2000 looking at the past 500 years of conflict, complete with exhibits and aircraft displays.

"Sinn Féin had announced that it would re-route the parade it is holding in Castlederg, County Tyrone in August. The march commemorates the death of two IRA men who died in 1973 when their own bomb exploded prematurely. After unionists called for the parade to be banned, Sinn Féin said the parade would no longer pass the town's cenotaph or Methodist church. Speaking after a meeting with the Parades Commission, DUP MLA Thomas Buchanan said that would not defuse the situation. DUP minister Arlene Foster repeated her call to the Parades Commission to ban the 11 August parade. The DUP said it is seeking a meeting with the chief constable to urge him to take action under legislation to stop the glorification of terrorism. Speaking ahead of a meeting with the Parades Commission, Sinn Féin's Ruairi McHugh said: ""Our initiative will consist of choosing to go along John Street which avoids passing the cenotaph and the Methodist church. 'Ethnic cleansing' ""On the back of this initiative, we wish to engage with all key stakeholders in relation to the issue of the town centre being designated as a shared space for all traditions, in this mainly nationalist town. ""There has been around 20 unionist parades through the town centre in 2013 so far without objection, we understand and accept people's Britishness- others need to understand and accept our Irishness."" Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has also written a letter to the commission urging them ""not to endorse terrorism"" by allowing the parade. UUP MLA Ross Hussey said Sinn Féin's offer to reroute the parade was ""the party trying to justify the unjustifiable"". ""They are trying to parade over the memories of IRA victims,"" he said. ""This situation has been choreographed by Sinn Féin and their proposal to re-route the IRA commemoration parade is part of that choreography. ""Sinn Féin knew right from the start that this parade would cause offence to the victims of IRA terrorism and the wider community. ""It is simply impossible for Sinn Féin to justify the unjustifiable. It is repugnant to hold a parade to celebrate the actions of terrorists and calls into question Sinn Féin's commitment to 'reconciliation'.""",The DUP has said Sinn Féin's rerouting of a controversial parade is meaningless.
"Melanie Hartshorn, 27, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) which causes her skull to sink into her spine. Her condition is so severe that last year she had to complete her Newcastle University degree exams lying down. But now the money has been raised for her to have an operation in Barcelona to fuse her skull to her spine. The syndrome means Miss Hartshorn's joints dislocate and cannot hold her body together. The operation, which will be carried out by a specialist neurosurgeon, involves fixing the cranium to her vertebrae to allow her to sit up and prevent brain damage. The cost of the surgery is £80,000 and a further £20,000 has raised in the last few days for an air ambulance flight to take her to Spain. Miss Hartshorn's condition is degenerative and she has needed multiple operations. While doing her degree, Miss Hartshorn, of Cramlington, Northumberland, had to do her exams on a stretcher and to work on assignments from home. She said: ""This is really life-saving surgery for me because it will basically attach my skull to my neck with screws. ""So far the plan is for the operation to be done on Monday. I know of five other people with the same condition as me who have had the same surgery and they are doing quite well. ""I hope it will be successful.

"New rules mean rescue centres can no longer return non-native animals to the wild following treatment. Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital said they have no room to keep the animals in captivity meaning they would have no choice but to kill them humanely. The government said non-native species threaten the UK's native biodiversity. Rules around releasing invasive non-native animals came into effect in October with grey squirrels, which were introduced to the UK in the 1800s from North America, becoming a target of the law. Muntjac deer, which were introduced into the UK from China in the 20th century, are also affected. What has changed? Under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it was already an offence to release grey squirrels without a licence, following treatment, but rescue centres could apply for one from Natural England. However, a new EU regulation - The Invasive Alien Species (Enforcement and Permitting) Order - which the UK government will uphold, means that this will no longer be possible. It means if a rescue centre is caught releasing one of the animals back into the wild they could face prosecution. While Leicestershire Wildlife Hospital and others are not being forced by the government to euthanise, they have no capacity to keep rehabilitated animals at the centres. The hospital is discouraging the public from taking injured squirrels to their premises. Harriet Childs, a team leader at the hospital in Kibworth, said: ""We're having to euthanise them for just being what they are and it's not fair. ""We had to do one on Sunday and it's a bit raw still. ""We take in over 5,000 patients [injured animals] in a year, to risk that by disobeying the licence wouldn't be good on our part. ""If we do take [squirrels and muntjac deer] in we have to euthanize them or keep them in a cage for the rest of their life."" The RSPCA said it was ""extremely disappointed"" that licences to release grey squirrels and muntjac back to the wild after rehabilitation are not being reissued. The charity said it supports some aspects of the legislation but ultimately it will ""result in the needless destruction of animals"". A Defra spokesman said: ""Invasive non-native species such as grey squirrel and muntjac deer threaten our native biodiversity and cost the economy £1.8 billion a year. ""The government is committed to ensuring the wide ranging impacts of invasive non-native species are reduced, and this order is an important tool to achieve this aim,"" he said.

"Inciting people to harass others online, known as virtual mobbing, could also result in court action, under new Crown Prosecution Service guidance. The director of public prosecutions said it means the CPS would prosecute just as if offences occurred offline. But she stressed this did not mean prosecutors could ""stifle free speech"". The new guidance aims to help police identify online crimes more easily. It also highlights those who post people's personal information, such as bank details - known as doxxing. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said: ""The internet's not an anonymous place where people can post without any consequences. People should think about their own conduct. ""If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline."" However, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example ""if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test"". 'Hateful names' One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times. The abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name. ""The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name."" The woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter. ""Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author. ""It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech,"" she said. 'No escape from it' She added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures. The incidents are now being investigated by police. Kevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work. He said: ""Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police. ""It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it"". Mr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad. ""With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything,"" he added. 'Sexting' ruling The CPS says it will use ""considerable caution"" before charging those posting ""grossly offensive"" material. The changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability. The CPS also said underage ""sexting"" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve ""exploitation, grooming or bullying"" may lead to legal action. Ms Saunders told the BBC: ""If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,"" she said. Asked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: ""We probably need to think about it."" A new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015. The public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.",Internet trolls who create derogatory hashtags or doctored images to humiliate others could face prosecution in England and Wales.
"The reveal of the golden Bassey's Cry, by artist Marc Rees, marks the start of a three-day celebration of arts, culture and creativity in Wales. The Get Creative Weekend, supported by BBC Wales, Arts Council of Wales and What Next? aims to encourage people to try something new. Mr Rees said: ""The statue is meant to jolt people into action."" The sculpture stands on a glass balcony in the walls of the castle, looking out over Gwynedd. Created in the likeness of Dame Shirley, the sculpture has a hole where her heart should be. The reason, Mr Rees said, was because like a body needs a heart, society needs art to flourish. ""I thought it would be brilliant to combine two very powerful female icons; one historical and one cultural,"" he added. ""The statue is a call to arms to protect the arts and a rallying cry for people to use their creativity."" Arts, cultural and voluntary organisations, groups and societies from across Wales are staging events and offering activities over the next three days, including the chance to play a Wurlitzer theatre pipe organ in Tywyn. There will be drama sessions in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, a sketchbook walk in Carmarthen and dance classes in Aberystwyth. Circus workshops will be held in Cardiff and there is a chance to work with ceramics in Porth. The weekend kicks off with a free event at Galeri, in Caernarfon, on Friday and you can find out what is on in your area here. The Get Creative Weekend comes as new research published by the Arts Council of Wales shows 41.2% of 1,000 adults surveyed in 2015 participated in arts activities once a year or more - the highest rate since 2009. The survey also shows 88.5% of 1,019 young people questioned participated in arts activities once a year or more - the highest level since data collection stated in 2007.",A 20ft tall Dame Shirley Bassey statue in a Boudicca pose has been unveiled at Caernarfon Castle.
"The Home Affairs committee has published its own register of PCCs, claiming ""no-one in government is keeping track"" of them. But chairman Keith Vaz said an official register was needed to guard against ""maverick decision making"". The Home Office said it was up to voters to hold PCCs to account. The report compiled by the Home Affairs Committee sets out the pay, weekly hours, other activities and staff costs for each of the 41 police areas in England and Wales. The register suggested ""a massive gap"" between the salaries and types of second jobs carried out by PCCs. Mr Vaz said: ""The public cannot possibly judge whether their PCC is upholding the standards of the office and giving them a good deal unless they make a comparison with other PCCs."" 'Electorate will judge' The Home Office says it will consider the committee's findings. ""By law, police and crime commissioners have to publish a register of interests, including budgets and expenses, and the key elements will be displayed on the national police.uk website,"" said a spokesman. ""The local electorate will judge whether PCCs are making best use of public money and hold them to account at the ballot box."" In October 2012, people across England and Wales went to the polls to elect local commissioners. Turnout was as low as 12% in some areas, prompting a critical review by the Electoral Commission. The PCCs' main role is to listen to public concerns on crime, and hold chief constables and the police force to account. The government hopes the new structure will increase the accountability of law enforcers. Several commissioners have been heavily criticised for decisions since their election. A special task force is looking into the chief constable of Lincolnshire's suspension by the local PCC, and a youth PCC resigned in Kent after she wrote offensive comments online. 'Suspicion' A national register of chief constables is currently being compiled by the government. The MPs' report argued that it would make ""clear sense to do the same for their elected counterparts"". ""The lack of such information centrally will inevitably encourage rumours, media speculation and suspicion, which may well be totally unfounded,"" the report stated. A previous investigation by the BBC's Home Affairs Correspondent Dominic Casciani found that the type of information published by different PCCs was widely varied, with no ready comparison available. The BBC political research unit's Ed Brown described some commissioners' websites as ""labyrinthine"".","Ministers are failing to properly monitor the salaries and professional standards of Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs), MPs have warned."
"He was reacting to criticism from the Celtic Manor, which is hosting the summit, in which managers said they were concerned about preparations. They expressed worries not enough was being done to ensure Wales benefits. Mr Jones and the Welsh Secretary also announced a business summit is to be held after the summit. Carwyn Jones said political differences between the two governments were being put aside during preparations for the summit, to be held on 4 and 5 September. The two men were speaking during a visit to HMS Dragon, which is currently moored in Cardiff Bay and is to receive the freedom of Cardiff this weekend. On Tuesday, the Celtic Manor Resort chief operating officer Ian Edwards told MPs that politicians had to prepare more to use the summit to sell Wales to the world. He said: ""I think the first minister has got to say to the prime minister, 'Look, we are 100 days to go; we've got nothing nailed down in terms of outreach programmes. How are we going to benefit from this? ""If we don't do it now and we don't line everything up we will miss that opportunity."" Tight security Responding to the criticism on Thursday, Carwyn Jones said his administration was working hard with the UK government, which is organising the summit for Nato, ""to make sure that we can host a number of events around the summit"". ""We need to know the final arrangements first, of course, and discussions are ongoing,"" he said. ""Because, of course, of the fact that security around the event is very tight we can't reveal anything publicly at this moment in time."" Welsh Secretary David Jones said the international business summit following the Nato meeting would be a major opportunity. ""Wales, of course, is home to a number of important defence related industries, we've got a number of them close to the Celtic Manor, where the summit will be held,"" he said. ""And I think it's a huge opportunity for those industries in particular to benefit from the world attention that will be focussed on Wales for those days.""",First Minister Carwyn Jones says Welsh and UK ministers are constantly discussing events they want to hold around the Nato summit in Newport.
"By Arwyn JonesBBC Wales education correspondent Members of the union NUT Cymru said the reading and maths tests put too much pressure on children too young, with one child even stopping eating. They also raised concerns it affected pupil morale and said the tests had little impact on attainment. The Welsh government said they were fundamental for raising standards. The tests were brought in last year in a bid to improve performance after Wales fell behind the rest of the UK in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). But teachers who took part in the survey claim they ""destroyed pupils' confidence"", ""caused major stress"", and one said they caused a child to stop eating. Another wrote: ""When the tests were completed I have never seen children's morale so low. It had such an impact on me I reported it to the head. ""Too much pressure, too young, the government do not care about little Billy or little Lucy, they have simply become data. What a shame."" NUT Cymru said the results echoed responses from 2013. The survey found: Owen Hathway, NUT Wales policy officer, said the feedback was ""very concerning"" and showed teachers were not convinced with the current system. ""Teachers have seen the tests have a negative impact on pupil engagement and have also seen complications with parents as a result of this initiative,"" said Mr Hathway. ""Some of the more direct feedback is difficult to read with teachers left exhausted by the impact these tests are having on pupil wellbeing."" The union has sent the responses to Education Minister Huw Lewis urging him to examine the nature and delivery of the tests. A survey by teaching union UCAC also raised similar concerns and said the tests undermined pupil confidence. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The tests and the data they provide are fundamental to raising standards in Wales and schools can use the diagnostic information from the tests to identify learners' strengths and areas for development. ""This means that a school can intervene if a pupil is falling behind, and also stretch the more able pupils.""","Annual school tests for children aged seven to 14 are causing so much stress some pupils are refusing to go to school, a survey of teachers claimed."
"Transport minister Norman Baker said the new nine-mile stretch between Fiveways and Thetford should be completed by December 2014. He made the announcement during a debate in parliament. Preliminary work on the scheme, expected to cost £131m, has already begun. 'Massive improvement' During the debate in the House of Commons, Mr Baker said: ""The massive improvement on the A11 between Fiveways and Thetford will be delivered by December 2014, so Norwich will finally get the road that it has perhaps been after for some time."" It is hoped the main works to transform the road will begin between January and March next year. The road will be closed for several nights during November to allow workers to clear the sides of the road where it will be dualled. Since June, the Highways Agency has carried out preliminary work including installing fencing and animal protection work. Archaeological surveys are also being done near How Hill Tumulus and between Chalk Farm and the B1106.",The government says work to dual the last single section of carriageway of the A11 through Norfolk and Suffolk will be finished in two years.
"Ian Jones told an audience at the Urdd Eisteddfod in Bala said the channel was managing to cope with cuts already made but had to be able to ""evolve and keep pace over the next decade and beyond"". He said people had to stop thinking of S4C as a ""Cinderella service"". The channel's current budget runs until 2016. Mr Jones said: ""Those who control the purse strings have to accept that a national channel deserves sufficient funding. ""It is high time we stopped thinking about S4C as some kind of Cinderella in the world of broadcasting. ""It shouldn't be a poor relative, but a national treasure. And there is a price to pay for that."" He said provision for future generations of young Welsh speakers had to be secured, and he wanted to work with others to ensure the language remained a ""contemporary medium"" in the face of technological change. Mr Jones also published a consultation document identifying key action points for discussion. The channel receives 90% of its funding from the licence fee and around 8% directly from the UK government's department for culture, media and sport.","Services on the Welsh language broadcaster S4C would be endangered if the channel is not sufficiently funded, its chief executive has warned."
"The hearing, at the high court in Belfast, centred around filming at a news conference given by the alleged British agent at his solicitor's office on 14 May 2003. The programme will be broadcast on Tuesday on BBC One at 22:40 BST. A BBC spokesman said the programme ""is of major public interest"". He added: ""Tonight's Spotlight is an important investigation by Darragh MacIntyre of allegations that Freddie Scappaticci was involved in the murder of alleged British informants while himself an agent of the state, codenamed Stakeknife, at the heart of the IRA.""",Lawyers acting for senior republican Freddie Scappaticci have failed in an attempt to prevent the BBC from running part of a Spotlight film on Tuesday.
"A special committee of parliamentarians said it backed the Slavery Bill's aims but urged major changes, including more protection for children, enhanced legal support and compensation for victims. It also said criminal offences should be simplified to help get convictions. Traffickers and slavemasters face possible life sentences under the plans Home Secretary Theresa May announced plans to crack down on human trafficking and other forms of modern-day slavery last August. The Modern Slavery Bill, which was published in November, aims to consolidate the offences used to prosecute those who enslave others into a single act. Under the government's plans, those convicted of the most serious offences could get a maximum life sentence, up from 14 years at the moment, while a new post of anti-slavery commissioner will be created to hold law enforcement and other organisations to account. 'Heinous' A special committee set up to scrutinise the bill said it was right that the government had recognised the ""heinous crime"" of slavery. which it said could take a multitude of forms - including forced prostitution, forced labour, domestic servitude in the home, and forced criminal activity such as marijuana farming. But it said sweeping changes were needed to the legislation to make it more effective, including simplifying the number of proposed criminal offences into six categories: slavery of children and adults, child exploitation, exploitation, child trafficking, trafficking and facilitating the commission of an offence of modern slavery. The committee also calls for: Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the committee, said the legislation was ""ground-breaking"" and would influence the fight against modern slavery around the globe. But he said parts of the bill needed to be totally rewritten, not simply amended. ""The shift to the focus on victims is not only the morally right thing to do in and of itself, it is essential if we are to get the prosecutions necessary to try to end this evil,"" he said. 'World watching' ""The world is watching: we have to get this right. ""In the 19th Century British politicians sought to abolish the international slave trade and end one of the most deplorable practices in history. Their hard-fought victory remains one of our Parliament's finest achievements. ""We must not betray that legacy - or the victims of slavery. ""We must make life as difficult as possible for today's slave masters and traffickers, and the position of the victims of slavery must be transformed."" Crossbencher peer Baroness Butler-Sloss said the bill as it stood ""overlooked the position of victims both as victims in need of support, but also as essential to getting convictions"". ""Unless and until the protection of victims, and the provision of support and services to them, are put on a statutory footing at the heart of this legislation, there is a risk that we will turn victims into criminals,"" she said. ""Apart from the fact that this would be morally wrong, it is also self-defeating."" Complexity Children's charity Unicef also urged the government to strengthen the proposals in its bill, by including measures to provide trafficked children with legal guardians. ""Even when trafficked children are identified they remain vulnerable and separated from their families. They face frightening interviews with various authorities and don't always receive the protection they need,"" the charity said. Unicef UK's deputy executive director Anita Tiessen said legal guardians would ensure the victims were ""protected by law and have a chance to rebuild their lives"". ""Guardians must be independent, established in law and given legal powers so that children get the support they need to stay safe,"" she added. The committee's report has been endorsed by Hollywood director Steve McQueen, whose film 12 Years A Slave won the best film at last month's Oscars and drew attention to the historical legacy of slavery. ""They have listened to the evidence and considered it with great care,"" he said. ""Their recommendations are humane and principled. ""More than that they have grasped the complexity of contemporary trafficking and forced labour in the United Kingdom and have set forth clearly the fundamentals of what is necessary to tackle it effectively.""","A proposed new law to combat modern-day slavery needs to be strengthened, with more attention given to victims of trafficking, MPs and peers have said."
"Dean Rogers, from the trade union for probation officers, said 107 people working for the National Probation Service (NPS) were earning less than minimum wage. He told Welsh MPs the NPS was ""failing on every level"" during evidence to a Westminster committee on Tuesday. The Prisons Service said a report had found the NPS was doing a ""good job"". Mr Rogers, who is general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said the service was ""the most dysfunctional organisation"" he had ever worked with. He told an inquiry by the Welsh Affairs Select Committee into aspects of the prison service that the union had reported the NPS over not paying staff the minimum wage. Mr Rogers said that probation responsibilities were split in Wales between a firm called Wales Community Rehabilitation Company (CRC) and the NPS. He said the process was ""very badly managed contract process"" by the Ministry of Justice and ""assumptions that the contracts were based on were wrong, and were known to be wrong, but they went ahead anyway."" He said all of the CRC's were finding it difficult to manage within the contracts because they were badly organised, structured and badly funded, and that was all preventable. A Prisons Service spokesman said: ""CRCs have reduced the number of people reoffending and the Chief Inspector's most recent annual report found that the NPS is doing a good job overall. ""Our reforms mean we are now monitoring 40,000 offenders who would previously have been released with no supervision at all."" ""But we have been clear there is more to be done - particularly on getting the basics right, and we are working closely with providers to make sure this happens."" A Wales CRC spokesman said: ""Our goal is to reduce reoffending over the lifetime of our contract with the Ministry of Justice, and initial results show that fewer people are reoffending ""We know there is more work to be done and we're committed to working with the Ministry of Justice to achieve our ambitious aims. At all times we make sure we deliver a safe service.""","The probation service has been reported for not paying staff the minimum wage, a union official has claimed."
"Chancellor - Philip Hammond Despite speculation that he would be sacked after the June 2017 General Election, Philip Hammond has remained chancellor of the exchequer. He was foreign secretary under David Cameron from 2014 to 2016, having previously served as defence secretary and transport secretary. Mr Hammond was a Remain supporter in the EU referendum and is seen as one of the leading cabinet voices for a softer version of Brexit than that advocated by Leave supporting colleagues. He is known by some around Westminster as ""box office Phil"" for his perceived dull delivery. Home Secretary - Sajid Javid After becoming an MP in 2010, Sajid Javid has risen swiftly through the ranks of the Conservative Party and government to become the first home secretary from an ethnic minority background. Landing the job following Amber Rudd's resignation, the son of Pakistani immigrants left behind his role as communities secretary. Mr Javid, a former executive at Deutsche Bank, has also had brief stints as business secretary and culture secretary. He stood on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb for the 2016 leadership contest, hoping to be chancellor if Mr Crabb had become PM. Foreign Secretary - Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt became foreign secretary after Boris Johnson resigned over Brexit policy in July 2018. It meant an end to his marathon stint as health secretary, a job he took in David Cameron's 2012 reshuffle, having previously served as culture secretary. He weathered a number of controversies including a 2015 battle with the British Medical Association over a new contract for junior doctors, which led to a series of strikes. He is thought to have resisted an attempt by Theresa May to move him to another job in her January 2018 reshuffle and succeeded in adding responsibility for social care - something previously overseen by local government - to his portfolio. Brexit Secretary - Stephen Barclay A major promotion for Stephen Barclay, 46, who becomes the third Brexit secretary in six months. Mr Barclay, who was previously a junior minister in the health and social care department, replaces Dominic Raab, who resigned in protest at Theresa May's draft EU withdrawal bill. Despite being regarded as a rising star Mr Barclay, who has served as MP for North East Cambridgeshire since 2010, was reportedly not Mrs May's first choice for the role, with Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also in the frame. And the job has essentially been downgraded to focus on domestic preparations for the UK's departure, with Theresa May personally assuming responsibility for the remaining negotiations with the EU. Defence Secretary - Gavin Williamson A close ally of Theresa May, the former chief whip ruffled a few Tory feathers when he was handed the role of defence secretary in November 2017, with some claiming he lacked the experience for such a vital role. He replaced Sir Michael Fallon, who resigned amid allegations over his past conduct. The appointment was Mr Williamson's first cabinet post. The MP for South Staffordshire was elected to parliament in 2010, and was previously an aide to David Cameron. Transport Secretary - Chris Grayling One of the government's great survivors, Chris Grayling has been in the cabinet since 2012, when he was made Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, before going on to serve as Commons leader. A leading voice in the Leave campaign, he was made transport secretary by Theresa May in July 2016. He defied predictions he would be sacked or moved in Mrs May's January 2018 reshuffle, after attracting criticism over rising rail fares, Southern Rail's disrupted services and rail franchising difficulties. The former BBC and Channel 4 TV producer has been MP for Epsom and Ewell, in Surrey, since 2001. International Trade Secretary - Liam Fox A veteran right winger and ardent Brexiteer, Liam Fox was put in charge of the newly-created department for international trade by Theresa May after she became PM, with the job of forging post-Brexit trade deals with other nations. He was David Cameron's first defence secretary but resigned in 2011 over allegations he had given a close friend, lobbyist Adam Werritty, access to the Ministry of Defence and allowed him to join official trips overseas. Mr Fox - who was a GP before entering politics - stood in the 2016 leadership race against Theresa May, but was eliminated in the first ballot after winning the support of just 16 MPs. Environment Secretary - Michael Gove Michael Gove's was a dramatic comeback in June 2017, when the prime minister brought him back into cabinet as environment secretary. That was just a year after his ministerial ambitions appeared to be over when he was sacked in the 2016 reshuffle which followed Mrs May's arrival as prime minister. Before that stint as justice secretary he had previously served as David Cameron's education secretary and chief whip in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition. His longtime friendship with Mr Cameron ended as he became probably the then cabinet's biggest name to decide to campaign for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum. Despite campaigning alongside Boris Johnson for Brexit and initially backing him, Mr Gove withdrew his support for Mr Johnson as Tory leader mid-contest, choosing instead to stand himself. He was eliminated in the final round of voting by MPs, coming third. Northern Ireland Secretary - Karen Bradley A former protege of Theresa May at the Home Office, Karen Bradley was handed the role of culture secretary in Mrs May's first cabinet. Her time in that job was dominated by her decision to refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox's takeover bid for Sky to the media and competition regulators, something that will be at the top of her successor's in-tray. She was first elected MP for Staffordshire Moorlands in May 2010. She replaces James Brokenshire as Northern Ireland Secretary, who resigned for health reasons Justice Secretary - David Gauke David Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer. He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005. Health and Social Care Secretary - Matt Hancock Matt Hancock was promoted to become health secretary in the wake of the resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson over Brexit policy. After only a few months as culture secretary, he got the call to move up the rankings to health when Jeremy Hunt was promoted from health to foreign secretary. Mr Hancock, who was close to the former chancellor George Osborne during the David Cameron years, is a former Bank of England economist has been MP for West Suffolk since 2010. He is the first MP in modern times to win a horse race, having raced to victory at Newmarket in August 2012. And his later appearances as culture secretary included attempting to moonwalk and jumping off a wall while having a go at parkour. Business and Energy Secretary - Greg Clark Greg Clark is another minister who has survived the transition from the Cameron to the May years. In his case he has been business secretary since July 2016, after a year or so looking after the local government brief. It had been widely speculated that he was to be moved in the January 2018 reshuffle to make way for Jeremy Hunt - but it did not happen after the health secretary successfully argued the case to stay put. The Middlesbrough-born former business consultant, who backed Remain in the EU referendum, started his political journey as president of the Liberal Democrat student branch at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Housing and Communities Secretary - James Brokenshire James Brokenshire returned to the cabinet following the reshuffle prompted by Amber Rudd's resignation as home secretary. The former Northern Ireland secretary had stepped down in January due to ill health after being diagnosed with the early stages of lung cancer - but was back in Parliament a month later after ""recovering strongly"" from lung surgery. The former lawyer is a close ally of Theresa May, having served under her for five years at the Home Office. Digital, Culture, Media and Sports Secretary - Jeremy Wright Jeremy Wright was promoted from attorney general to be the new culture secretary after Matt Hancock's promotion to health secretary in July 2018. The moves were in Theresa May's reshuffle in the wake of David Davis and Boris Johnson's Brexit resignations. A barrister specialising in criminal law, Mr Wright became an MP in 2005, serving in the whips office for the Conservatives under David Cameron from 2007 to 2012 before becoming a justice minister in 2012 and becoming attorney general in 2014. International Development Secretary - Penny Mordaunt Penny Mordaunt replaced Priti Patel in this role in November 2016, after Ms Patel resigned in the wake of disclosures that she had held a series of unofficial meetings with senior Israeli figures. Ms Mordaunt was previously minister of state for disabled people at the Department of Work and Pensions. She was minister for the armed forces under David Cameron, and had been considered a contender to replace Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary. Penny Mordaunt, elected to parliament in 2010 as MP for Portsmouth North, is also known for her strong support of Brexit. Leader of the House of Lords - Baroness Evans Baroness Evans was appointed Lords Leader in 2016 - her first ministerial role since being ennobled by David Cameron in 2014. She attended London's Henrietta Barnett School and Cambridge University before becoming deputy director of the Conservative research department, deputy director of the Policy Exchange think-tank and chief operating officer of the New Schools Network - the organisation, headed by controversial journalist Toby Young, which runs the free schools programme. Scotland Secretary - David Mundell One of 13 Scottish Conservatives to be elected to the Commons in the June 2017 snap election. Former prime minister David Cameron first appointed Mr Mundell to the post of Scottish Secretary when he held his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale seat for the third consecutive election in 2015. In January 2015, Mr Mundell became the first openly-gay Conservative cabinet minister. Work and Pensions Secretary - Amber Rudd Amber Rudd returned to cabinet in November to replace Esther McVey as work and pensions secretary. Mrs Rudd resigned as home secretary in April amid a row over targets to remove illegal immigrants. A strong ally of Theresa May, Amber Rudd is known for her pro-EU views and has a reputation as being tough and capable. She has served as MP for Hastings and Rye since 2010 and was promoted swiftly during David Cameron's time in office. However the 2017 election saw her majority reduced to just 346, diminishing her prospects as a possible future leader. Education Secretary - Damian Hinds Damian Hinds got an unexpected promotion when he was drafted in to replace Justine Greening, who refused a move to the Department for Work and Pensions in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former management consultant was a Remain supporter and previously served as employment minister in the DWP and before that a junior Treasury minister and government whip. He has been MP for East Hampshire since May 2010. Welsh Secretary - Alun Cairns Alun Cairns, MP for the Vale of Glamorgan, remained in his cabinet role as secretary of state for Wales in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. The former banker and Welsh assembly member was born in Swansea and is a graduate of the University of Wales, Newport. He became an MP in 2010. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - David Lidington Former Commons Leader David Lidington replaced Damian Green, who resigned in December 2017 after misconduct allegations. The Remain supporter did not take on Mr Green's First Secretary of State title but will still play part of that role, standing in for Theresa May at Prime Minister's Questions and chairing key cabinet Brexit committees. He is a former justice secretary and Europe minister. The Cambridge history graduate and father-of-four has been MP for Aylesbury since 1992. He previously worked for BP and mining firm Rio Tinto. Conservative Party chairman - Brandon Lewis The new Conservative Party chairman takes the title of minister without portfolio, allowing him to take a seat in the cabinet. He replaced Sir Patrick McLoughlin, who stood down as Tory chairman. The former housing minister briefly served as immigration minister before taking on the job of rebuilding the Tories' campaigning strength for the next general election. A former barrister and leader of Brentwood council, in Essex, he has been MP for Great Yarmouth since 2010.

"Sharon Price and fiance Andy Price were trying to recreate its final dance scene in a pub garden in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset. Mr Price said: ""I was concussed. I was out. I ended up in a neck brace and had to have a CT scan. ""We were about 30ft apart and Sharon ran and I grabbed her hips and the next thing we knew we were flat out."" Mr Price said he had a mild heart attack several years ago and so the medical experts were ""just being careful"" with the tests they ran. They were discharged from hospital six hours later. ""Dirty Dancing"" began trending on Twitter as news of the couple's mishap spread around the world. The 1987 film, starring Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, is one of Ms Price's favourite films. ""I've always watched it and me and my daughter watch it, over and over again,"" she said. ""We thought it would be something different. Everybody else slow dances, so we thought we'd jazz it up a bit."" On Saturday, on the ""spur of the moment"", the couple decided to ""get a bit of practice in"" and try out the famous Hollywood dance move. ""There was no build up, no warm up and that was it,"" said Mr Price. ""I think I knocked myself out hitting the floor as hard as I did. I wasn't too aware of what was going on after that."" Ms Price is also unsure: ""I can remember running towards Andy and then the next thing just struggling for breath and my back was hurting."" With him ""in and out of consciousness"" and her conscious but ""struggling for breath"" - an ambulance and rapid response vehicle were called and the couple were taken to Southmead Hospital. The couple, who coincidentally have the same surnames, said they would rethink their first dance for the wedding. ""I don't think we'll have that one at the wedding, I think we'll go for a traditional slow one and I'll let Andy choose,"" said Ms Price. #DirtyDancing was one of the top hashtags in the UK on Twitter earlier. Worldwide there was a 92% increase in people using the hashtag earlier compared to the previous six hours, according to social media measurement tool Spredfast. There was also a spike in people searching for Dirty Dancing online with lots of people searching for ""Dirty Dancing Bristol"". The story made the news around the world including in Australia, the US and Ireland.",A couple knocked themselves unconscious practising a lift from classic 1980s film Dirty Dancing for their wedding.
"By Sanchia Berg and Meirion JonesBBC Today programme and BBC Panorama NSPCC chief Peter Wanless also said there should be a duty on institutions like hospitals, children's homes and boarding schools to report abuse. The charity had previously opposed all forms of so-called mandatory reporting. New inquiries into child abuse could consider possible law changes. Mr Wanless, the chief executive of the child protection charity, is heading a review looking at concerns that the Home Office failed to act on allegations of child sex abuse contained in a dossier handed over in the 1980s by former Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens. Another independent inquiry, looking at historical sexual abuse and institutions' protection of children, will be led by retired senior judge Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. Meanwhile, a former West Mercia Police officer has told the BBC he saw documents in the 1990s suggesting the existence of a paedophile network involving public officials and clergy. Terry Shutt was involved in the 1992 arrest of Peter Righton, a founding member of the Paedophile Information Exchange who was convicted of importing child pornography. Mr Shutt, a former detective constable, told the BBC that five suitcases of letters found when Righton's home was raided pointed to a paedophile network but he was ""confident that the main link into the establishment"" was not followed up. The Metropolitan Police said it could not comment on the case but a police source from the time said it was ""nonsense"" to say the investigation was closed down. Mr Shutt's comments are among a number of claims relating to the alleged activities of child abusers dating back to the 1960s. Home Secretary Theresa May has said Baroness Butler-Sloss's review will examine the case for mandatory reporting. Historical child abuse claims: Key questions answered Why has this come up now? Labour MP Simon Danczuk last week called on Leon Brittan to say what the then home secretary did with documents he was passed in the 1980s containing allegations about powerful figures and paedophilia. What happened to the files? Lord Brittan passed them to Home Office officials and a 2013 review found the minister had acted appropriately. What did the papers allege? The allegations, compiled by Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens, were set to ""blow the lids off"" the lives of powerful child abusers, the MP's son has said. The late Mr Dickens said he planned to expose eight such figures.

The NSPCC would be open to discussions about what form the new law should take, he added. Alan Wardle, head of policy at the NSPCC, told BBC Breakfast its priority is to criminalise the ""act of cover up"". ""What we've got to do is find a way that people protect children first and ensure that their reputation is not the primary concern,"" he said. ""That's a problem we've seen in some of these institutions, the institutional cover up where child abuse has been swept under the carpet and not dealt with. ""People have been quietly moved on to abuse children in other institutions."" Alan Wood, president of the Association of Directors of Children's Services said he would like a system which is ""much more open"". He said: ""We're against anything that makes the system more complex, we have to give much more confidence to people in the system. ""I'm not sure the first step is to move towards mandatory requirement for reporting because people need to be confident that they can report effectively, people need to be confident that they're reporting the right thing."" Timeline: Historical child abuse claims 1982-84: Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens says he plans to expose eight prominent figures as paedophiles. He also gives files to then Home Secretary Leon Brittan, who passes them to officials August 2013: The Home Office says copies of Mr Dickens's material were ""not retained"" but that Lord Brittan acted appropriately in dealing with the allegations 7 July 2014: Lord Brittan dismisses claims he failed to act appropriately. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May announces two reviews of historical child sex abuse allegations - one into the way public bodies handled claims and the other into the Home Office's handling of paedophilia allegations Full timeline 'Growing consensus' In many other countries, including the US, Australia and France, people can be prosecuted for covering up abuse. In Britain, child protection organisations - including the NSPCC - have traditionally felt there was no need for such a law. The charity said boarding schools, residential care homes and hospitals should have to pass information on to the police or the local authority, rather than just investigate themselves. Liz Dux, a lawyer with Slater & Gordon, which represents 176 victims of serial abuser Jimmy Savile, said the NSPCC's turnaround is ""welcome and significant"". Last year Sir Keir Starmer, the former director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, became the first senior legal figure to call for a law which would require all institutions to report allegations to an outside body. He said: ""There is now a growing consensus that mandatory reporting should be introduced. This shift in position is significant. The real challenge now is to devise a model that works in practice."" Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said ""I think this is a really significant U-turn for the NSPCC and hugely welcome - it's a big step in the right direction."" In the last year churches and the children's commissioner have expressed their support for mandatory reporting. Education Secretary Michael Gove was opposed to it but said victims had made a compelling case for it, and he is currently reviewing the law. In the meantime, Liberal Democrat peer Lady Walmsley has proposed an amendment to the Serious Crimes Bill, to be discussed later this month, which would make reporting of sexual abuse or physical abuse mandatory for all institutions.",The man leading a review into how the Home Office handled historical allegations of child abuse has said people who cover up such crimes should be prosecuted.
"Seventeen of the victims were shot, while 64 were assaulted. There were 12 paramilitary assaults in June of this year, the highest figure in a single month since April 2009. In the previous 12-month period, there were 79 paramilitary-style attacks, including 20 shootings and 59 assaults. An advertising campaign targeting the paramilitaries behind the attacks is being relaunched on Monday. The Ending the Harm campaign is part of the Northern Ireland Executive's action plan to tackle paramilitary activity, criminality and organised crime. Radio adverts and social media activity will begin on Monday, while TV adverts are to be broadcast from next Monday. Anthony Harbinson, from the Tackling Paramilitarism, Criminality and Organised Crime Programme Board, said the campaign had been effective. He said before it was launched, research showed that 35% of people living in areas most affected by paramilitary activity thought the attacks were justified in certain circumstances. He said the most recent research showed that has dropped to 19%. ""The purpose of this campaign has been to highlight the devastating toll these attacks have and help people understand that the criminals who carry out these attacks don't care about people, or justice, or solving social problems in communities,"" he said. ""They don't offer protection and they are only interested in exerting control and exploiting people for their own gain, using violence as a means to do so. ""But the reality is these barbaric attacks are still an issue of concern.""",Eighty-one people were victims of paramilitary attacks in Northern Ireland between July 2018 and June 2019.
"Workers at Dunlop Aircraft Tyres in Erdington have been told 199 jobs may go, while 21 new roles will be created, the GMB trade union said. Air travel has been hit hard around the world after travel restrictions were imposed by governments during coronavirus lockdowns. The firm said it could not afford its current level of staffing. It employs almost 450 people at its Erdington headquarters. The grounding of commercial flights and airline operators entering bankruptcy has meant a ""sharp reduction"" in demand and a long-term impact on the industry that will not see it ""return to normality for a number of years"", Gordon Roper the firm's chief executive, said. 'Come back stronger' He said the firm would be ""fundamentally restructuring the organisation "" to cut its wage bill, as well as ""reviewing the terms and conditions of employment for those that remain in the business"". Redundancies will be phased with the first losses occurring immediately after a 45-day consultation process with the union, Mr Roper added. The figure of 199, represents a ""worst-case scenario for a prolonged downturn in the industry"". However, he said there was a chance for fewer cuts if the company could secure greater market share or if demand grew at a stronger rate than forecast. Stuart Richards, from the GMB said the union was having an urgent meeting with the firm on Friday to discuss the proposals, as well as other issues that have been raised. ""There's been a short-term fall in orders and as for the the wider picture, we know there are orders in the pipeline but we need to look at the long-term,"" he said.

"He made the comments as Welsh ministers outlined possible risks to the NHS, the economy, transport and farming if the UK exits the EU without a deal. Mr Drakeford said a no deal Brexit will have effects that will ""be felt by everyone"". Tory AM Darren Millar accused ministers of ""project fear on steroids"". UKIP's Gareth Bennett accused the Welsh Government of scaremongering, but Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the reality of House of Commons made necessary contingency planning for a no-deal Brexit. Theresa May's proposed deal with the EU was rejected by MPs last week, in a historic defeat. The Welsh Government had opposed Mrs May's deal, and prefers one that would bind the UK closer economically to the EU. The comments come ahead of a meeting between the first minister and the prime minister on Wednesday. 'The only option' Mr Drakeford told the Senedd that the impacts of a no deal Brexit ""are potentially far ranging, and will be felt by everyone"". In remarks indicating he was moving closer to supporting a further referendum, Mr Drakeford said: ""The debate in Parliament over the next week is the last opportunity to rally around that form of Brexit, one which has at its heart a future relationship based around continued participation in the single market and a customs union. ""If that cannot be done, the severity of 'no deal' is so great that if Parliament cannot agree a majority position on a deal that secures our long term economic interests, then the only option which remains is a second public vote to break the deadlock."" The Labour first minister has said he may campaign to remain if another EU vote was held. It would not be for the Welsh Government to call a referendum but supporters of a further vote, including members of his own party, have called for him to lobby for one. Mr Drakeford called for Mrs May to take a no-deal Brexit off the table and extend Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU on 29 March. Much of the assembly's business that had been planned for Tuesday was scrapped, making room for statements on Brexit preparations. In the Senedd Julie James, Welsh Government minister for local government, said there is no need for individuals to stockpile food: ""We are not expecting widespread food shortages of any description."" But she said ministers are looking to ensure that ""that supply chains for things like school meals or elderly persons facilities are still able to get all the ingredients they normally have"". Health Vaughan Gething, health secretary, warned AMs that while the number and type of medicines that might be effected by a no deal Brexit is ""relatively low"", ""the UK government cannot provide full assurance that Brexit will not affect business as usual"". He said disruption from customs checks at ports is likely to render radioisotopes useless for healthcare treatment, while a study had been commissioned to see how many EU workers are employed in social care and child care. But UKIP's Michelle Brown questioned why the work had not been done before. ""The referendum was over two years ago,"" she said. Analysis by James Williams, BBC Wales Brexit correspondent In the 'Being First Minister' documentary that followed Carwyn Jones' last months in office, there's a scene in which he's taken to task by his special advisers for saying in the assembly that the Welsh Government is not planning for a no-deal Brexit. Back in November 2017, Mark Drakeford, then effectively the Welsh Government's Brexit Secretary, told a committee of AMs: ""No amount of public money, no amount of preparation, will avoid the harm that will be done to Wales and its economy by leaving the European Union without a deal."" Having now stepped-up to the top job, Mark Drakeford is trying to give a very different impression of a government that is doing all that it can to prepare for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit - limited as that may be. But despite the six statements in the assembly on Tuesday, a Welsh Government source tells me that ministers are purposefully keeping some of the no-deal Brexit planning, specifically around emergency planning, out of the public domain for fear that they become self-fulfilling prophecies. They are, however, keen to get one overarching message out there time and again - a no-deal Brexit should be taken off the table. Transport A no deal Brexit could ""cause severe disruption to the transport network and connected services within Wales"", according to Ken Skates, the minister responsible for transport and the economy. Mr Skates said there could be delays at ferry ports. While Pembroke Dock and Fishguard have space for delayed vehicles, Holyhead would find it more difficult. Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Although UK government modelling says delayed traffic could be dealt with within the port, contingency measures are being considered - the nearby Road King truck stop and other sites have been identified. Gareth Bennett, UKIP group leader, questioned why a whole day's business had been scrapped ""largely to indulge in a day of project fear"". ""They are just wasting time with more scaremongering and a lot of people in the chamber today are fed up with it,"" he told BBC Wales. The sentiment was echoed by Tory AM Darren Millar who said in the Senedd that the warnings amounted to ""project fear on steroids from the Welsh Government, without any temperance whatsoever for their position"". He made the claim after Jeremy Miles, who speaks on Brexit on behalf of the Welsh Government, said a no deal Brexit meant ""fewer jobs, lower incomes, and a greater risk of poverty in communities throughout Wales"". Plaid Cymru's Adam Price called for a Welsh citizens assembly, which could be a precursor to a further referendum, to address ""deeper issues... that Brexit has laid bare"". Farming Earlier on Tuesday rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths told a press briefing she was concerned that only 1,600 farmers out of a possible 2,000 had signed up for a red-meat benchmarking scheme to prepare for Brexit. ""I do wonder if farmers have buried their heads in the sand a little bit around Brexit,"" she said. Ms Griffiths said farming leaders had told her that a no-deal Brexit posed a ""cliff-edge of a perfect storm of really significant disruption to the Welsh economy"". She added that no-deal could lead to the shellfish industry collapsing, while tariffs for some products could exceed 50%.",First Minister Mark Drakeford says he will back a further referendum if MPs cannot resolve the Brexit deadlock in the next week.
"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter Jonathan Powell was the government's chief negotiator for Northern Ireland from 1997 until 2007. Unionists have expressed concerns about Mr Johnson's Brexit deal splitting NI from the rest of the UK. Mr Powell said how the prime minister is dealing with Northern Ireland right now was coming from a ""position of ignorance"". Mr Johnson agreed a new deal with the EU last week, which included special arrangements for Northern Ireland. It would allow the UK as a whole to leave the customs union, but Northern Ireland would continue to follow some EU customs rules. The Northern Ireland Assembly, if sitting, would get a straight majority vote in 2024, to decide whether to keep following the rules. The DUP has opposed the deal. It had argued that any vote must be on a cross-community basis, in line with how most contentious matters are decided at Stormont. That cross-community voting system was set up under the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, which Mr Powell helped negotiate. He told BBC's The View: ""It's so unwise to play games with this. This peace process is a seesaw, if you jump on one end, the other end's going to go flying in the air. ""A sensible government should be balancing that."" 'Identities attacked' He said the new Brexit deal undermines the identity of unionists in Northern Ireland, and warned against people taking an ""I-told-you-so"" attitude to the DUP for trusting Boris Johnson. Mr Powell added: ""I can understand why people feel glad the DUP has been shafted after them making this close alliance. ""But that's an unwise attitude for the long term. This peace process has two parties at the centre, and if either of their identities are attacked we'll have difficulties sustaining that."" The former negotiator said Mr Johnson had not understood what he had agreed to for Northern Ireland in his Brexit deal. He added that hardly anyone in the government had any ""real knowledge"" of the situation. Asked about the ongoing political deadlock in Northern Ireland, Mr Powell described it as very frustrating. He said that as long as Brexit is ""hanging over people, it will be very hard to get the institutions back up and running, because it undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process"". ""It doesn't have to be terminal if people come to their senses - it can be saved but it is very worrying."" This interview will be broadcast on The View on BBC One NI on Thursday night at 22:35 BST.","A negotiator of the Good Friday Agreement has accused Boris Johnson of ""playing games"" with the peace process."
"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter It comes after Downing Street said it will bring a new law that could change post-Brexit customs plans with the EU. Sinn Féin, the SDLP, Alliance and the Greens said the UK and EU must ensure the ""rigorous implementation"" of the NI protocol. Number 10 said it will only make ""minor clarifications in specific areas"". Political parties at Stormont are divided over the government's plans, and held an emergency debate to discuss it when assembly members returned to the chamber on Monday for the first time following summer recess. The joint letter from the leaders of the four parties, which all supported remain in the EU referendum, was published on Monday afternoon. It states that while the NI Protocol was ""imperfect"", it guaranteed in all circumstances that there would be no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""It is entirely unacceptable to the Northern Ireland parties that the UK Government would seek to abandon these safeguards and mitigations, which we believe would amount to a serious betrayal of an existing international treaty,"" the letter adds. ""The economic and political impact on the island of Ireland, on the UK and above all on the people whom we represent would be devastating, and long-lasting. ""It would represent a shocking act of bad faith that would critically undermine the Good Friday Agreement political framework and peace process and the UK's ability to secure other crucial deals to protect the Northern Ireland economy."" The four parties call on the UK government to ""honour its commitments"" and ensure the protocol is implemented rigorously. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? The Northern Ireland part of the Brexit deal, known as the Protocol, was agreed in October last year and is due to come into effect at the end of this year. It is designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland - or even any new checks at the Irish border. It does this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. This will mean products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will be subject to new checks and control - the so-called Irish Sea border. However, the precise nature of these checks needs to be agreed by the EU and UK and are being negotiated in parallel with the trade talks. It will also mean when relevant EU laws are amended or new ones are drawn up, they will also apply in Northern Ireland. Under the plan, Northern Ireland would leave the EU customs union with the rest of the UK at the end of this year, but would continue to enforce the EU's customs code at its ports. Details on the nature and extent of goods checks at Northern Ireland ports are still to be agreed, ahead of the transition period ending on 31 December. The government, however, denied that its plans would tear up the existing withdrawal agreement, arguing that it was ""taking limited and reasonable steps"" to clarify specific elements of the NI Protocol in domestic law. Downing Street will not allow the UK's internal market to ""inadvertently be compromised by unintended consequences"" of the Protocol, a spokesperson added. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland are strongly opposed to the plan for Northern Ireland in the Brexit deal, fearing it damages the UK union. 'NI question back on agenda' The DUP's chief whip at Westminster, Sammy Wilson, said he would ""reserve judgement"" until he saw the terms of any bill put forward this week. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, the East Antrim MP said he wanted to see how the government would set out the detail. ""It would not be beyond the bounds of possibility that Northern Ireland is simply being cynically used in negotiations with the EU between now and the end of the year,"" he said. ""Having been bitten once, we are not going to say that this is absolutely great, all I am saying is this, that the Northern Ireland question is now back on the agenda. ""It is back on the agenda because of the huge efforts we put in since January until now to spell out the consequences for Northern Ireland from the withdrawal agreement and also show how it spills over into policy for the rest of the United Kingdom."" Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said ""the most important thing"" for people in Northern Ireland was to consider the implications of the NI protocol. ""When it comes to state aid rules, or whether it comes to access to our supermarkets for goods coming from the rest of the country, if there is an opportunity to reconsider these elements in the protocol, now is the time,"" he told BBC News NI. However, Mr Aiken criticised the ""mixed messages"" coming from Westminster. SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon has said ""not enough clarity"" is being provided to the executive from the British government. She was taking questions in the assembly and was asked about the government's plans to bring a law that could change the NI part of the deal agreed with the EU. ""If reports are true, this is entirely unacceptable. Any threat of a hard border must be resisted by the assembly and executive,"" she said. The executive meets weekly and also holds a regular sub-Brexit committee. ""It is clear to me, that not enough clarity is being provided to ministers from the British government and I'll be pressing for answers,"" said the minister. Although the UK formally left the EU in January, it has continued to follow rules set in Brussels during a transition period - which ends on 31 December - while discussions over a long-term trade agreement continue. Another round of talks - the eighth - begin on Tuesday, aimed at securing a deal to allow companies to trade without taxes or customs checks. But Mr Johnson is expected to tell EU leaders it must be agreed in time for the European Council meeting on 15 October, if it is to be in force by 1 January.",The leaders of four pro-EU Stormont parties have written to the British government and EU urging commitments on NI in the Brexit deal to be kept.
"Prof Eugene Milne called on the area's seven councils to ""act together"" to fight the virus everywhere. He warned the virus was ""not going to obey administrative boundaries"". His comments came after an MP lobbied for County Durham to move to tier two if cases there fall. Durham, Newcastle, Gateshead, Northumberland, Sunderland and North and South Tyneside all adopted the same local measures in September in an effort to slow the spread of Covid-19. They have all been under tier three restrictions since the end of England's national lockdown earlier this month. Prof Milne said: ""One of the things that was clear from the previous action that was taken in September collectively is that it was effective partly because it covered the natural distribution of people's movements. ""It covered commuter areas, it covered the way people move in and out of the city and around the area. ""That geographical coherence is quite important. From that point of view, it probably makes sense for us to act together rather than separately."" On Thursday in the House of Commons, Richard Holden, Conservative MP for North West Durham, called on Health Secretary Matt Hancock to allow Durham ""to go a separate way"" and exit tier three if cases there dropped. Moving to tier two - high alert - would allow restaurants, and pubs and bars offering a ""substantial meal"" to open, while groups of up to six people could socialise in private gardens. South Tyneside had the highest infection rate of the seven council areas in the week from 7 December to 13 December, with 322 cases per 100,000 people. Durham had 151 cases per 100,000 people, while Gateshead recorded the lowest rate with 105 per 100,000. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

"Brian TaylorPolitical editor, Scotland Let me explain - inasmuch as one can use such a precise word as ""explain"" in connection with such a complex and contentious issue as Brexit and its implications. It strikes me there are two distinct areas where Holyrood is entitled to be consulted with regard to Brexit. These are being cheerfully confused by sundry politicians and commentators. The first area concerns the negotiations with the European Union which will lead to Britain's departure from the EU. The second concerns the bill which will be tabled to legislate for the return of EU law to the UK. Let us take these in order. Theresa May, David Mundell and colleagues have all said, repeatedly, that the UK government will negotiate terms for the UK as a whole leaving the EU. It is almost as if they have a rehearsed line on this matter. Which, of course, they do. UK ministers say that the Scottish government will be involved, will be consulted, will be engaged - perm any one from those three verdicts. But there will be no veto. However, that characterisation is not accepted in terms by the Scottish government. They want participation, not consultation. They want to help frame the terms of the UK's negotiating package and, where relevant, they want to advance those terms in talks with the EU. To be clear, they do not describe that as a veto. To repeat, they choose not to use that word. Indeed, Nicola Sturgeon has taken pains to avoid such a description. She has noted, for example, the view emanating from Wales that the Brexit package should be subject to endorsement not just by the Commons but by all the devolved legislatures in these islands. She adds that there are certain attractions to such an argument - but she herself is not advancing it at this stage. Why? Three reasons. One, she genuinely wishes to extract as many concessions as possible for Scotland from the UK Brexit process - and sees conciliation as the route. Negotiation process Two, politically, she calculates that a troubled and anxious public would welcome a note of co-operation - along the lines of the customarily seductive argument: ""Why don't they all just sit down and sort it out?"" Three, it rather suits her if direct conflict over this issue between the UKG and the SG is deferred. If she is to call indyref2, she would rather not do it now - while the UK, including Scotland, is in turmoil and the terms of Brexit have yet to emerge in any meaningful way. But, to repeat, Ms Sturgeon and the Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell are looking for far more than is currently on offer in the negotiation process from the UKG. They were, therefore, exasperated to see the outline process of Brexit pre-emptively announced to the Conservative conference. They griped a little - but calculate that Mrs May requires to unite her party around a future direction: one which consoles Remainers, a little, while assuring Leavers that Britain will do just that. Leave. So the SG/SNP complaints were mostly confined to social media muttering. For now. Why? See above re the need to sustain a mood of conciliation. So much for Part One. Enter Part Two. This is the statute which will be necessary to repeal Britain's membership of the EU and to repatriate those laws which are currently dispensed by or shared with the European institutions. It is described by its advocates as the Great Repeal Bill. Some would dissent from that adjectival choice. Although they would probably accept that alternatives would fail to stir the blood. The Limpid Repeal Bill? Let us talk, neutrally, of the bill. Would it require to be endorsed by the Scottish Parliament under a Legislative Consent Motion (LCM) - previously known as the Sewel Convention? The UKG says no - although not all that assertively and not all that loudly. Their argument is that the bill would be concerned solely with foreign affairs and the constitution. Both those issues are reserved to Westminster. QED. Except, says Mike Russell, the said legislation would impact directly upon areas which are explicitly devolved to Holyrood: such as justice, home affairs, rural affairs, the environment etc etc and - you've guessed it - etc. Devolved matters How can it be, he says, that Holyrood is not to be consulted on such matters which virtually define its list of powers? Ah, say UK ministers, Holyrood will be ""consulted"" - but not via the requirement for an LCM. The legislation only covers the EU ambit with regard to such devolved matters. Not the matters themselves. Thus it is foreign affairs and/or the constitution. And so reserved. Nonsense, says Mr Russell, this is legislation directly affecting devolved matters. LCM required - and, for now, there is no majority at Holyrood for such consent to be granted. To be clear, again, Mr Russell does not and will not threaten that this situation amounts to a prospective veto - even if his interpretation proves to be correct. For one thing, his objective is to use the possibility of an LCM as a negotiating lever to give him more clout in Part One - the formulation and promulgation of UK Brexit policy. For another thing, Mr Russell and Ms Sturgeon are only too well aware of the limits of an LCM. Suppose it is eventually conceded that an LCM there must be. That Holyrood must vote upon the EU departure bill. Holyrood may then decline to give consent, presumably on the grounds that the other element of the deal - Part One - has not gone well, from the perspective of Scottish Ministers. But, at the pinch, UK Ministers may then say: ""So Holyrood declines to consent? These things. How sad. We had hoped to proceed by consensus but hey and, indeed, ho. Westminster is sovereign. Onwards and upwards."" Not, you will readily understand, particularly good politics. Mrs May and her colleagues will indeed wish to proceed via consensus if possible. But the issue of sovereignty remains there, in the background. If needed. For now, we await the detail. In particular, we await the triggering of Article 50 in the spring and the introduction of the Bill in the subsequent Queen's Speech. But matters are moving.","Does Holyrood hold a veto over Brexit? The UK government would say no. Twice. The Scottish government would say no. Twice. But that is because it does not care to use the word ""veto"". And indeed has not done so."
"Morag Olsen, who was chief operating officer and deputy chief executive at Hull and East Yorkshire NHS Trust, is now looking after health in north Wales. Her post was one of those recommended by health and audit watchdogs which had criticised the board's management. The board was attacked for its handling of a C. difficile outbreak. A report by the Healthcare Inspectorate Wales and the Wales Audit Office found the board's management had not taken proper charge of the outbreak of the gut infection at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Denbighshire. Ms Olsen was previously director of nursing and operations at Trafford Healthcare NHS Trust in Greater Manchester when it saw a dramatic fall in rates of infection by C. difficile and the hospital superbug MRSA. In June this year, the health board's new chairman, Peter Higson, said the NHS body needed to win back the confidence of patients.

"Leicestershire County Council said rising costs and funding cuts meant it had to find £100m by 2018 - a third of current annual spending. While £35m has already been identified, the Conservative-led authority has asked people to help set areas for cuts and those than need protecting. Officials denied the process was a public relations exercise. Deputy leader of the council Byron Rhodes said that by the end of the cuts, the council will have shrunk by a third. 'Dire situation' ""We have to talk to people, it is only right that we should as we are here to serve them.

"Jack Roberts, who was born in 1917 and died in 2005, worked for Coe's photographic studios in Norwich and started taking pictures in the 1930s. His shots of the city in the 1950s and 1960s provide a rare glimpse of forgotten streets. The exhibition aims to include the memories of local residents. In August, the Portraits of Life team at The Forum in Norwich is hoping to record the memories of people who lived in streets which were redeveloped. They include Golding Street, Ashford Street, Napier Street, Charles Street and Wiggs Passage, Botolph Street, Distillery Street, King Street, Crusoe Street and Barn Road. While many photographers concentrated on the landmark buildings such as the cathedrals, Mr Roberts would photograph ordinary residential streets. Bill Smith, curator of the Jack Roberts Archives, said: ""A lot of the Victorian houses around King Street would be gentrified these days, but under different planning laws they were condemned and new homes built."" He said other buildings were demolished for road-widening schemes such as St Stephens Street and Grapes Hill, which had both suffered bomb damage. ""A lot of the buildings the Germans did not destroy, the city planners did,"" Mr Smith said. Andrew Coe, a great grandson of the founder of Coe's photographic studios, said he was 15 years old when he went to work for the family firm and met Mr Roberts, who was already working there. He said Mr Roberts ""got to know everyone"" and added: ""He was very unassuming and got on well with everybody from sales directors to factory workers"". ""Jack would have known an awful lot of people who lived in the homes which were to be demolished. ""Jack loved the city and saw it changing. He wanted it to be remembered."" Portraits of Life is running as part of the Norfolk Heritage Open Days from 13-22 September. The team at The Forum will be recording people's memories ahead of that on 12-17 August.",Photographs of streets lost in World War Two bombing or post-war redevelopment are to go on public display for the first time.
"By Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent, BBC News Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - the NEC - matters. It can help or hinder Sir Keir Starmer in his efforts to prove the party really is under new leadership. And his control over it is on a knife edge. The NEC brings together representatives from across the Labour movement - from the shadow cabinet, the parliamentary party, councillors, the unions and the grassroots membership. Polling closes on Thursday for the election of nine grassroots members - along with the election of Wales, youth and disability representatives, and a party treasurer. A BAME representative was elected separately and the Scottish Labour leader also sits on the body. The election results - due out at 12:00 GMT on Friday - should be a clue to the party's future direction. When left candidates - including Momentum's founder, Jon Lansman - swept the board early in 2018 in elections for the grassroots seats, it signalled that Jeremy Corbyn and his allies had finally gained control of the party machine. Work to do The NEC has a lot of contentious issues in its in-tray. It will draw up rule changes designed to implement recommendations of the Equality and Human Rights Commission in tackling anti-Semitism. It will also have to respond to a forthcoming report from the Forde Inquiry in to the party's internal culture. This was set up following the leak of a report which claimed that the previous leadership had been undermined by party officials and argued that factional interests had undermined the election campaign. And ultimately the NEC - or at least a panel drawn from its membership - could decide the political fate of Mr Corbyn, currently suspended from the party for suggested Labour's opponents had dramatically overstated the scale of anti-Semitism. Balance of power While Sir Keir has not lost any major votes on the NEC since his election in April, his hold is tenuous. Two reps elected in the summer suggested a move away from Momentum - the group set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - was taking place at the grassroots. The successful candidates came from the Labour To Win ticket - representing the ""moderate"" groups Labour First and Progress. One of its declared aims is to ""work together to make Keir Starmer's leadership a success"". Allies of Sir Keir say only 18 of the current 37 members are solidly reliable. Some others - including the representatives of the GMB union - are usually helpful, but as one insider put it: ""They usually want something in return."" So Labour to Win is looking for reinforcements. But the method of electing representatives has changed from a first-past the-post system to a form of proportional representation, where candidates are ranked in order of preference. The effect of this will be to make any result less clear-cut. This change was backed by the party leadership. One staunch Starmer supporter said it was about ""managing risk"". While the voting system would prevent Labour To Win from sweeping the board, it eliminated the risk of Momentum doing so too. In other words, if there is a backlash against decisions taken by the new leadership, any damage would be limited. So under the new voting system, we are likely to see Momentum's standard bearer and former MP Laura Pidcock elected, alongside the leading candidate from Labour To Win - Luke Akehurst. He runs the Labour First group to help rally and organise critics and opponents of the Corbyn leadership. One of its avowed aims is to ensure ""the party is kept safe from the organised hard left"". But it is less clear how well the rival camps will fare overall. Momentum candidates are bullish about their prospects and believe the message of stopping a rightward drift will play well with the activist electorate. Labour To Win does not lack confidence either. The membership has changed to an extent since the general election, as some Corbyn supporters have left the party while some of his opponents joined, or rejoined, to support Sir Keir's leadership campaign. But if there are no clear-cut winners in the grassroots seats, the role of the NEC members appointed by the affiliated unions becomes more crucial. Acting in Unison? Three big unions affiliated to the party - and which generously donate funds to Labour - will also see a change of leadership over the next year or so. Each has representatives on the NEC. There's an imminent contest in the public service union Unison. Its 1.3 million members have been sent ballot papers and the contest closes on 27 November, with the winning candidate taking over from veteran leader Dave Prentis in the New Year. Under his leadership, Unison nominated Sir Keir to become Labour leader, but it is by no means certain that another ally will replace Mr Prentis. His favoured replacement is Christina McAnea - an assistant general secretary who has said she supports Sir Keir's leadership. She has been nominated for the job (though not unanimously) by the union's executive committee and more than 200 local branches. Ms McAnea grew up on a Glasgow council estate and her campaign has focused on what she can do to improve working conditions. She is seen as a tough negotiator who has delivered for NHS staff. And although a long-standing (though not lifelong) Labour member, union insiders say she does not see things through the prism of internal party politics. But her elevation to the top job is not guaranteed. She faces tough competition from Roger Mackenzie - another assistant general secretary and Unison's first senior official from a BAME background. His candidacy has been endorsed by none other than Mr Corbyn - who said: ""Roger and I have stood together on picket lines, on demonstrations together, and he did a huge amount of work supporting my leadership campaigns."" In a twist in the contest, the campaign group Labour Against Anti-Semitism has made a complaint against Mr Mackenzie to Labour headquarters, based largely on his social media activity. He denies any anti-Semitic behaviour. The party is investigating. And this week, complaints have also been made to Unison which sources say are ""being looked into"". However, even were Mr Mackenzie to be suspended subject to investigation - and I'm told that's by no means certain - the union's rules would not stop him running for office. His opponents believe that his profile has been boosted by his support for a campaign to reinstate Mr Corbyn. If he too was suspended by either the party or the union, they fear that this may not derail his campaign. Indeed, in an election where turnout among the wider membership is expected to be low, but higher among left-wing activists, he may actually receive a boost. Another left-wing candidate is already suspended from the union, but is also taking part in the contest. Paul Holmes - who is employed by Kirklees Council, in West Yorkshire - came third in the 2010 contest and has vowed to take his current £32,000 salary if elected, and not the six-figure sum that comes with the job. He has campaigned to sell off the union's expensive London HQ. The fourth candidate is Hugo Pierre, who isn't a Labour member. He is backed by the Socialist Party, a successor organisation to the Trotskyite Militant Tendency, and is not expected to come close to winning. It's a first-past-the-post election so with the left-wing vote split three ways, Ms McAnea remains favourite. But if much of the activist vote were to coalesce behind Roger Mackenzie, things could all become politically more choppy for Sir Keir in the New Year. Putting the house in order An imminent change of leadership was also expected at the GMB union - the UK's third largest - following the departure of the previous general secretary Tim Roache amid allegations of misconduct. He said was resigning on grounds of ill health. The timetable, though, has slipped following a devastating report by Karen Monaghan QC on the culture at the union. She found ""bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment"" were endemic. I am told that the union's ruling body has made dealing with this, and an internal probe in to the circumstances around the previous general secretary's departure, a priority - hence the delay. A contest in March next year has been mooted but not confirmed. Putting the union's own house in order is seen as more important than internal Labour politics. A GMB insider suggested that any likely candidate would have to be informally ""vetted"" to ensure they were not tainted by any criticism. However, the internal rumours are that the likely candidates will be the relatively youthful Scotland regional secretary Gary Smith, and union's public services lead Rehana Azam. Given the strength of the Monaghan report, and the previous lack of women in the most senior positions, Ms Azam would most clearly represent a break from the past. But neither candidate is thought to be problematic for Sir Keir, and newly installed interim general secretary Warren Kenny, son of the former GMB leader Sir Paul Kenny, is seen as convivial to the party leadership. United We Stand? Potentially the biggest problem for Sir Keir is if the leadership of the union most generous in its funding of Labour moves from being critical of him to downright hostile. Unite gave the party £3m in the run-up to the last election. Current general secretary and Corbyn ally Len McCluskey has said he will stand down in 2022, though some in the union still believe he may go a little sooner. In any case, the contest to replace him will begin next year. One candidate - Howard Beckett, who already represents the union on Labour's NEC - has been enraged by Mr Corbyn's suspension. He has said that ""an attack on Corbynism is an attack on all of us"". Mr Beckett has advocated reducing the union's contributions to Labour and devoting cash to setting up a broadcasting rival to the mainstream media. Unite already punches above its not inconsiderable weight on Labour's NEC and under his leadership he would, at the very least, also be throwing political punches at the current Labour leadership. A left-wing rival - and the candidate of the union's United Left faction, Steve Turner - is seen as more willing to do deals with Sir Keir than act as a rival power base. It is also likely that a member of the union's executive, Sharon Graham, also on the left, will campaign to become the first female general secretary, with a focus on improving her members' lot rather than seeking to get involved in internal Labour struggles. But considering another attempt at the top job is Gerard Coyne, who challenged Mr McCluskey last time and lost narrowly. A split in the left vote in a first-past-the-post contest could help him. He was seen as close to Labour's former deputy leader Tom Watson after the latter's relations with Mr McCluskey soured. This contest is likely to be dramatic and bitter - the NEC elections certainly won't be the last word in internal party disputes. So if the NEC elections tilt Sir Keir's way and the contests in three biggest unions are ultimately won by candidates who are willing to be constructive, he could end up with an even more supportive party machine than his predecessor. But his critics haven't gone away. The contests could turn on very narrow margins and potentially make it more difficult for him to effect a change in his party's direction.","The UK's three biggest unions are changing leadership, while Labour's governing body has been holding elections. What does all this mean for Sir Keir Starmer?"
"The Royal Cornwall Hospital says it had to cancel 14 operations in one day because no beds were available. Hospital managers said partners such as Cornwall Council were not taking enough patients out of the hospital. The council said it had been unaware of the problem and resented being ""blamed"". The hospital said it had more than 50 patients who were ""medically fit"" to leave but could not be discharged due to a lack of community health support. It said cancelling operations at short notice was ""unacceptable"" and said NHS Kernow, Peninsula Community Health and Cornwall Council needed to ""step up to the mark"". 'Surprise' Duncan Browne, interim medical director at the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust (RCHT), told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""Our priority is to keep patients safe and we need our partners in social care and community care to provide the packages of care and the beds for these patients that no longer need to be here."" Chief executive Lezli Boswell added the trust was ""deeply sorry"" and it was working with providers to resolve the issue. Kim Carey, director of adult care, health and wellbeing at Cornwall Council, said the situation had ""come as a bit of a surprise"" on Monday evening. She said if she had heard about it earlier, plans could have been put in place to ""de-escalate the problem"". ""I am disappointed that we have got to another crisis at the hospital where the blame is being put on other partners,"" she said. ""We really need to look at all parts of the system, not just bits of it. ""I cannot have the council blamed for a situation that isn't just our responsibility."" 'Huge frustration' She said 10 people with complex social care needs had been moved from the hospital on Monday. ""We need to look at people requiring social care and we will work with our health partners to get those people out as soon as possible,"" she said. Hospital managers warned the situation could get ""significantly worse"" with increased demand over the winter. Mr Browne said the hospital was prioritising patients with life-threatening cases, but the situation was a ""huge frustration for all our staff"". Patient Lynne Young, from Indian Queens, told BBC News she had spoken to the anaesthetist, the surgeon and had a cannula inserted into her hand before being told there were no beds available and she had to go home. She said: ""I don't understand why the hospital hasn't come up with a strategy to prevent this from happening."" 'Dreadful situation' Mr Browne said: ""We try and ensure that everyone can have their operation on that day and so we sometimes have to wait until the last minute. ""We also don't know exactly how many patients are going to be coming through the Emergency Department and we can't tell until the last minute how many people will be discharged to other environments such as community beds."" Sarah Newton, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, said: ""Now is the time for the chief executive and leader of Cornwall Council to get round the table with the leaders of our local NHS and sort out this dreadful situation.'' NHS Kernow's managing director Joy Youart said: ""I would like to apologise to those patients whose operations were cancelled or were unable to be discharged from hospital. ""We are working closely with health colleagues to ensure that such circumstances occur as rarely as possible. "" Peninsula Community Health said: ""We work closely with all our health and social care partners on a daily basis to ensure that patients receive care in the right setting for their needs.""",Patients have had operations cancelled at a hospital during a row between managers and care providers over bed-blocking.
