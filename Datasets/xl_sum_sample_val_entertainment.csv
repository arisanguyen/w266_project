"Shelagh Fogarty will also move on in the autumn as part of a daytime shake-up for the BBC talk radio station. Derbyshire said it would be ""a huge wrench to leave"", while Bacon said he would ""always be grateful"" to 5 live. The new schedule will see Adrian Chiles and Peter Allen host a new mid-morning programme, 5 live Daily, and a new afternoon show on every day but Friday. Chiles will host 5 live Daily in the 10:00 to 13:00 slot on Mondays and Tuesdays, with Allen hosting for the rest of the week. BBC Sport presenter Dan Walker and BBC Northern Ireland's Sarah Brett will co-host the other new show, Afternoon Edition, from 13:00 to 16:00 on Monday to Thursday. Simon Mayo and Mark Kermode's Film Review show will retain the afternoon slot on Fridays after a new Friday Sports Panel between 13:00 and 14:00. Tony Livesey will take on Allen's current role as co-presenter of Drive, with Chris Warburton taking over Livesey's slot on Weekend Breakfast. Punditry show Fighting Talk will also have two new hosts in Georgie Thompson and stand-up comedian Josh Widdicombe. ""Victoria, Shelagh and Richard have all played such key roles delivering fantastic live radio and I wish them every success with their future projects,"" said 5 live controller Jonathan Wall. ""This Autumn feels the right time to refresh parts of our schedule as we follow on from what's already proving to be a wonderful sporting summer."" ""5 live has been a spectacular place to work, I've got nothing but good things to say about it,"" said Bacon, whose new projects include a BBC One talent search for ""Britain's best amateur painter"". ""It's been a hugely important part of my career and life, and I'll always be grateful, and a listener."" In her own statement, Fogarty said 5 live had given her ""some of the happiest times and richest experiences"" of her working life. ""I'm very sad to be leaving but it's definitely time to do so,"" she went on. ""I'm spending the summer exploring a number of opportunities, before deciding what's next."" Derbyshire, meanwhile, spoke about her departure at the end of her show on Tuesday. She said she would be launching a new show ""elsewhere on the BBC"" while revealing she would still be doing ""collaborations"" with 5 live. ""You and I have shared so many experiences so I want to thank you so much for trusting me,"" she told her listeners. ""I will definitely miss all of you.""","Richard Bacon and Victoria Derbyshire, two of the biggest names on 5 live, are to leave the station later this year."
"By Chi Chi IzunduVictoria Derbyshire entertainment reporter It comes after some sites were criticised during a Department of Culture Media and Sport select committee hearing earlier this month. An industry expert suggested the volume of ticket sales was not reflected in company accounts. Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said she would raise the concerns with HMRC. At the hearing in November, ticketing expert Reg Walker said: ""This is meant to be a £1.2bn industry in the UK alone, and yet we can only find a turnover of around £200m on published accounts."" In response, Mrs Bradley said she would ""ensure that the concerns highlighted during the evidence session with regards to the under-reporting of income are raised with HMRC"". She met members of the live entertainment industry on Wednesday to discuss issues raised during the select committee hearing. In a statement, HMRC said: ""HMRC will always act where we believe individuals and businesses are not declaring their income correctly or paying the tax that they owe. ""Our compliance teams target specific sectors and locations where there is evidence of high risk of tax evasion and fraud and we use intelligence from various sources. ""In all cases, we look at compliance against a variety of taxes including VAT, self-assessment and corporation tax."" The four biggest secondary ticketing websites - Seatwave and GetMeIn, which are both owned by Ticketmaster, plus Viagogo and Ebay-owned Stubhub - are already under investigation by the Competitions and Markets Authority. Ticketmaster and Stubhub have declined to comment on the HMRC statement, while Viagogo are yet to respond. Selby and Ainsty MP Nigel Adams has proposed an amendment to the Digital Economy Bill to outlaw the use of computer programmes known as bots, which touts use to buy up large numbers of tickets to resell them at higher prices on secondary platforms. He joined other MPs and members of the live entertainment industry outside Parliament on Monday to call on the government to accept the amendment. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.","The tax affairs of the secondary ticketing industry are being targeted by HM Revenue and Customs, the Victoria Derbyshire programme has learned."
"Card Player was a study for Cezanne's celebrated series of oil paintings, entitled Card Players. It was only known to experts through a black and white photograph until it resurfaced in the collection of Dr Heinz Eichenwald, who died last year. It was sold by Christie's in New York and depicts Paulin Paulet, a gardener on the artist's estate in France. The painting was bought by an anonymous bidder. Meanwhile, a Matisse floral still life titled The Peonies also fetched $19m at the auction. Tuesday's sale was a warm-up for Wednesday's auction activity, when Sotheby's will offer one of the world's most recognisable artworks, Edvard Munch's The Scream. Sotheby's said the artwork's price tag could exceed $80m (£50m). The world record for a painting sold at auction is the $106.5m (£70m) paid for Pablo Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves, and Bust in 2010.",A Cezanne watercolour that was recently rediscovered after 60 years has been sold at auction for $19 million (£12m).
"The US writer who lives in London and was previously shortlisted for the prize in 2009 and 2013, received £15,000 for her story about a woman who cheats death. Zadie Smith was named runner-up, receiving £3,000 for her story Miss Adele Amidst the Corsets. Chair of the judges Alan Yentob called Shriver ""a worthy and deserved winner"". ""From a fantastic shortlist, Lionel Shriver's Kilifi Creek stood out as a wonderful evocation of life in miniature, crossing continents and generations. Shriver proves that short really is sweet,"" he said. The author, who is best known for her novels We Need to Talk About Kevin, So Much for That and The Post-Birthday World, was presented with her prize at a ceremony at the BBC's Radio Theatre in London. 'I almost died' ""I love working in a form that doesn't consume a couple of years,"" Shriver said about writing short stories rather than novels. ""Ironically, low temporal risk can facilitate high-risk style and content. In a short story, you can try anything."" Talking about her winning story, first published in The New Yorker last year, the author said: ""I have a little collection in my head of the occasions on which I almost died. Some of these are dramatic, but in others, to an observer, nothing would have occurred. For these are experiences of what didn't happen. ""But I have a keen sense of the 'counterfactual,' as one critic observed, which is only by way of saying I have some imagination, some appreciation for how at numerous junctures I might have veered in a different - in some cases, fatal - direction."" The three other shortlisted authors, Tessa Hadley, Francesca Rhydderch and Rose Tremain, received £500. All five shortlisted stories, read by five actors including Carey Mulligan and Rebecca Hall, can be listened to online until the end of October. The National Short Story Award is open to writers resident in the UK and was launched in 2006 in collaboration with the Book Trust. Previous winners include Sarah Hall, James Lasdun, Julian Gough, Clare Wigfall and David Wilson.",Lionel Shriver has won this year's BBC National Short Story Award for her story Kilifi Creek.
"Wolfgang said the sellers were ""taking advantage of my father's passing"", and he had ""nothing to do with"" the sale. ""I don't EVER plan on selling any of my father's iconic guitars,"" he said. Julien's Auctions said two of the guitars were submitted for sale weeks before Eddie Van Halen, co-founder of rock band Van Halen, died in October. The revered 65-year-old guitarist had been receiving treatment for throat cancer. Wolfgang Van Halen added that one of the guitars sold had been a gift, adding: ""It WASN'T for charity. They're just taking advantage of my father's passing. What a surprise."" He also suggested the only place they could ""possibly belong in is a museum"". Julien's Auctions said the instruments in the sale were a custom-designed 2004 ""stage-played"" guitar, a ""customised and played"" guitar and a ""music video guitar"" that was used for the 1984 single Hot For Teacher. The latter was a non-playing prop that was used by a child actor who played a young Eddie Van Halen, according to Rolling Stone magazine. Darren Julien, president and chief executive of the auction house, said: ""We, along with Eddie Van Halen's millions of fans, are mourning his family's and rock music's tremendous loss, and are honoured to keep his music legacy alive with the offerings of his memorabilia and instruments. ""We've auctioned many of Eddie Van Halen's iconic guitars in the past years and this year was no exception with these two guitars which were consigned to our Icons & Idols Trilogy: Rock and Roll sale weeks before we learned the sad news of his passing."" Van Halen were best known for their song Jump, which hit the top of the US charts in 1984. Their other hits included Why Can't This Be Love and When It's Love. Wolfgang, who became Van Halen's bassist in 2006, paid tribute to his father when he died. ""Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift,"" he wrote. Kiss singer Gene Simmons remembered the musician as a ""Guitar God"", while Queen guitarist Brian May remembered how ""those truly magical fingers opened a door to a new kind of playing"".

"By Vincent DowdArts Correspondent, BBC World Service Sunday 24 January 1954 should have been a day of rest for Richard Burton. The actor was in the middle of a long season starring at the Old Vic theatre in London. The previous evening he'd done Twelfth Night and the company was busy rehearsing Coriolanus, with Burton in the central role. The coming week involved three performances as Hamlet. Yet Burton hadn't hesitated to take part in a Sunday night tribute at the Globe Theatre (now the Gielgud) to his fellow Welshman Dylan Thomas. The poet had died in New York 11 weeks earlier at the age of 39. Burton, a decade younger, had been shocked at the loss of his friend. At the Globe he read Thomas' poems including the famous Fern Hill. The rest of Sunday was also taken up with Thomas's unique gifts as a writer. Burton and an all-Welsh cast spent the day in studio 6A at Broadcasting House rehearsing and recording Under Milk Wood. It was a radio script which BBC producer Douglas Cleverdon had been coaxing for years from Thomas and which was finally delivered in October 1953, a month before the writer's death. Burton's role as narrator had been intended for Thomas but he died before the recording could be made. With time tight, that day the play was recorded almost as live, with little editing or mixing possible. It was broadcast the next evening on the BBC Third Programme. It proved an immediate hit with critics and audiences (though some suspected too many blue jokes lurked amid the torrent of language). To this day you can hear technical faults with Cleverdon's production which were never fixed. But Burton's narration (shared with Richard Bebb) had a rawness which gripped listeners: his unforgettable baritone voice was at its finest. 'Quite extraordinary' No one remains from the 1954 cast but the actor Robert Hardy remembers attending some of the rehearsals with Burton, with whom he was appearing at the Old Vic. The two had known each other for a decade. ""Rich and I met at Oxford because we were both on a course for the RAF. To start with we disliked each other quite enormously. He thought I was a spoilt child of privilege and I thought him rude and rough and quite untenable. ""Then we discovered we both adored Shakespeare and could quote almost endlessly from any of Shakespeare's history plays. It was the beginning of friendship. ""So there we were at the Old Vic, busy with Hamlet and Coriolanus, when Rich said 'Oh you have to come along to this new play I'm doing for the BBC - it's quite extraordinary and you'll love it'. ""Perhaps Rich thought it might appeal to the Welsh in me but he was right: to sit in on rehearsals and hear that script delivered for the first time was astonishing. ""For my money his Coriolanus at the Old Vic shortly afterwards was a truly great performance - not a term I use lightly. I think the voice he used on radio, which people loved, came in part from his doing great work at the Old Vic. Born Richard Jenkins, as a young man the actor was unofficially adopted by Philip Burton - a writer and teacher who eventually went to work for the BBC in Wales. Richard came to regard Philip as a mentor and second father. People often ascribe the power of Richard Burton's voice to his Welshness but Robert Hardy thinks that's a simplification. ""It was always a sort of abandoned Welsh accent. Rich had been influenced by Philip Burton who worked on his voice to give it a degree of expressiveness which at times became almost orchestral. ""You hear that in Under Milk Wood. But it wasn't the way Rich had grown up talking or in fact how anyone in Wales grew up talking."" 'Effortless and natural' In 1963 the BBC broadcast a new version of the play with Richard Burton, now a huge film star, doing the whole narration. The recording is technically cleaner but most critics thought it lacked the energy of the original. Among the 1963 cast was Welsh actress Dorothea Phillips, now in her eighties. She's one of the few people who remember acting with Burton on radio. ""Obviously Richard had a beautiful voice: it always felt effortless and natural. But I think English people and Americans don't spot that it wasn't really very Welsh. ""There was a tone and a musicality to his voice which was extraordinary. When he spoke he could do almost every note in the scale and make it seem entirely unforced. ""His acting voice was slightly Welsh but it was completely and utterly mesmeric and very expressive. ""Some people said there was a melancholy to Richard's voice but the Welsh are melancholy by nature. It's the quality of hwyl - a word which doesn't quite translate into English. At times Richard had it."" Dotty Phillips thinks the talents of Burton and Dylan Thomas were perfectly matched. ""Dylan wasn't even 40 when he died so we'll never know what other collaborations there might have been on radio or in the theatre. ""I remember seeing Richard on stage in the 1950s. In the theatre he had the ability to convince you he was absolutely real. Most actors don't do that. ""Richard was a wonderful reader and actor for radio. Yes the voice was beautiful but that's not all that mattered. ""It was his intelligence: as you listened you knew precisely what he was thinking as you heard the syllables fall. And that is an art.""","Sixty years ago this week, the actor Richard Burton starred in what many think the best radio play ever written - Under Milk Wood. In 1954 Burton was just starting a dazzling career as a movie star - but for the rest of his life he looked back on Under Milk Wood as one of his great achievements."
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter, BBC News He is the king of the diddymen, the squire of Knotty Ash, the clown with the tickling stick and the owner of the most famous front teeth in the land. If the number of catchphrases is a mark of a comedian's success, Ken Dodd has done well, with such trademark sayings as ""how tickled I am"" and ""by jove missus"" and nonsense concoctions like ""tattyfilarious"" and ""discomknockerated"". At the Museum of Liverpool to launch an exhibition of photographs taken during his career, he fluffs up his hair for the cameras and wields a discomknockeratingly large tickling stick. This is his 60th year as a professional comedian - so has the eccentric image helped his career? ""I'm not eccentric,"" he protests. ""Not in the least."" The funny thing is, he does not appear to be joking. In fact, he seems to take offence at the suggestion. Until now, the interview has been conducted with Dodd, eyes half-closed, recalling early BBC broadcasts from clubs and music halls in the 1950s. But now he is upright, looking me square in the eye. ""I'm better dressed than you. You're wearing denim trousers. You look like an out-of-work plumber. ""I'm not eccentric. Why am I eccentric?"" There is the hair, the outfits, the tickling sticks, I suggest. ""The hair bit - when I was a little boy I always wanted curly hair,"" he replies. ""And part of it is a slight - only a very slight - rebellion. ""I think all comedians are rebellious in various degrees. But I don't think I'm eccentric, no. Not in the least. I think I'm a very, very staid person. Very, very conservative."" Not eccentric? Pull the other one, Doddy. He has cultivated the persona of the daffy professor of comedy since making his professional stage debut in 1954, inspired by the entertainers he saw while growing up in Liverpool. When Dodd was just seven or eight, his parents would take him and his brother and sister on weekly trips to variety theatres in the city. ""Slowly this curtain would go up and you'd be transported into a magical world,"" he recalls. ""Everything was rosy glow. Everything looked wonderful, happy. ""This man came on - he'd wear a check suit with a red face and he'd shout at the audience. He would say things and everybody would fall about laughing. I thought, that's a good job, that's what I want to be."" Today, his live sets are stuffed with affably absurd rapid-fire gags (""On Friday, there was a tap on the front door. That plumber's got a funny sense of humour""), plus slow-building storytelling and sentimental songs, to which he adds humorous lyrics. At times, his humour is masterful and timeless. At others, it is musty and old-fashioned, often based on ""oo-er-missus"" innuendo or creaky stereotypes of her indoors versus a useless husband. His crowds, largely made up of fans of a certain vintage, do not seem to mind, and the performances on his seemingly never-ending tour still regularly last five hours and more. ""Comedians are jesters and jesters have a fools' licence,"" he says. ""Political correctness doesn't apply to us. We are encouraged to say things that everybody would love to say but are scared stiff of saying. A jester is part-entertainer, part Mr Happy, part-anarchist."" The star often speaks of how there are two Ken Dodds - the comedian and the real man. Asked what the private Ken Dodd does on his days off, he paints a picture of someone who is more serious than his on-stage image might suggest. ""I can sum it up in one word - thinking,"" he replies. ""As you go through life, you're given this wonderful brain to think with. Everybody wants to know the meaning of life. Where we've come from, where we're going to, what we do while we're here. Yeah, there's a lot of philosopher in every person's private life."" Dodd also spends a lot of time researching the history and workings of humour. He used to visit a library in every town in which he performed, scouring books about comedy and comedians. ""There are about 22 different rules for creating gags, comedy, jokes,"" he explains. At one point, Dodd mentions in passing how ""the audience are my family"". This is a reference to the fact that has never had children. He has also never married, although he has a long-term fiancee, Anne Jones, a singer, pianist and flautist who is the support act on his tour. The star says he was always ambivalent about having a family of his own, but has recently been reflecting on the subject while thinking about his own parents, who he describes as ""the best mum and dad in the world"". ""I was driving the car about a year ago and suddenly the thought swept over me - by what right did I have to demand that two people, my mother and father, should take care of me, look after me, feed me, clothe me, nurse me when I'm ill? ""We don't have any right to this. The more I think about this, this one word keeps popping up, a word that's much abused and maligned, but the word has been there for centuries - love. ""There are all different kinds of love. Parents must love their children. I don't know. I suppose I would."" In other words, he would have loved his children. He takes a rare pause for thought. ""I love my dog. I love him very, very much,"" he goes on. ""And all the dogs I've ever had, I've always loved them. So I must have the capacity to do it."" The interview time is up and the real Ken Dodd retreats again. Eccentric? Yes. But there is more to him than meets the eye. The exhibition, titled By Jove! It's Ken Dodd!, features photographs by Stephen Shakeshaft and runs at the Museum of Liverpool until 21 April.","Ken Dodd is the last star comedian from the variety era. Now 86, he is still drawing crowds for his five-hour stage shows. Opening an exhibition about his career, he gets serious about life and laughter - and why he does not like being called eccentric."
"Amol RajanMedia editor@amolrajanon Twitter Did you, like me, lean over to the side of your bed, stop your alarm, enter the passcode for your smartphone, click on the little icon for a social media app, and find yourself inanely scrolling through your feed to see what people you have never met have to say about something you don't care about? You do realise, don't you, that in doing that, you were pointing a super-computer at your face, and encouraging algorithms to in effect scan your personality, building up a sophisticated, nuanced, and detailed profile of you, readily shared with countless people and companies you've never heard of, which in turn will determine which adverts you see when you wake up a week from now. Or sooner. Perhaps after that, and making the kids' breakfast, you decided to bid for four minutes of freedom while getting changed, and asked the smart-speaker in your bedroom or kitchen to play a great bit of music. Let's be generous and assume you have great taste in music, so you played Loving Pauper by Dillinger. And then maybe, after you left the house, sorted the kids out at school, and made your merry way to work, you got a tenner out from the ATM, and touched in and out on the bus/tram/train you use to get to work. And all the while, you were checking your smartphone, for the latest updates from someone you've never met about something you don't care about. Or - let's be generous again - maybe it was updates from someone you do know, about something you don't care about. 'Biggest transfer of power' By the time you got to your desk at work today, even more bleary-eyed and exhausted, your pupils freshly blasted with searing beams of blue-white light, what have you achieved? Getting the kids to school alive and fed was great, sure; and maybe you've read what your favourite hack had to say about the latest departure from Strictly. I tell you what else you've achieved though. You've made a few, probably Californian, companies that bit richer. These are the richest companies in human history, so they didn't need your help, but still... You've also successfully given your consent - or have you? - to a vast plethora of interminable Terms & Conditions. Each of the companies whose service you've used has different Terms & Conditions. You signed up to the lot. And be honest, have you read the Terms & Conditions of Google, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, or Instagram? Do you dare to? Do you care? I have, so you don't have to. Together, they are a chronicle of the biggest transfer of power from individuals to corporations in human history. This has happened exceptionally fast (in about two decades) very recently, and probably without your giving it much thought. But you should. In a crucial decision due early next year, the UK's Information Commissioner will decide whether the presumed consent that these companies trumpet as the moral fulfilment of their business model is, in fact, unfair. And the Commissioner's Office (ICO) has already said it has deep concerns about whether individuals are indeed fully aware of what they are signing up to. This is about ad tech - the technology behind modern advertising platforms on social media. Tech giants such as Facebook have hired teams and teams and teams of very clever and expensive lawyers to make their case - which is a sure sign of their concern. It is important to note that Facebook in particular, and especially under Nick Clegg's reign in their policy unit, have said they agree there needs to be better regulation, and have called for it since long before the former Lib Dem leader got into his Californian hot-tub. Still, the stakes here are huge. If the ICO decides that the presumed consent to Terms & Conditions for all these companies is a hollow idea, that could have a profound impact on their business models. They are, after all, fundamentally a very modern extension of the 20th century advertising industry, able to map our behaviour and sell predictions about our interests to those with a message to sell - whether personal, political or commercial. If you undermine the moral or legal integrity of ad tech, as currently constituted, you undermine the very basis of big tech, in this country at least. Ravi Naik, a data lawyer who worked on the Cambridge Analytica case, believes that citizens and consumers are not really providing fully informed consent when they use these services, and that the ICO's imminent adjudication is a huge moment for the tech sector. It may at least prompt us to have a more mature conversation about the data-soaked world in which we live. Generational divide I have written on this page about why it's important to understand that data is not the new oil, and radical policies may be required to address the fact that, in a world where the share of wealth going to workers is falling, and data giants employ relatively few people while legally avoiding vast sums of tax, we are witnessing an unprecedented asymmetry of knowledge and power. But it begins with an informed public - which, by the way, is where journalism comes in. Citizens everywhere should be much less naive about the trails of data they leave behind them every day. Hardly a passing thought to most of us - but gold dust to the data giants. The tech companies have an intellectually plausible - even reasonable, they would argue - defence. In return for free services, they build profiles of you which advertisers can use. They are more transparent than they have historically been: you can see the Terms & Conditions if you like. And there is a generational divide here: millennials and a younger cohort may be relaxed about sharing their most intimate details online; those who grew up in the Cold War, less so. If the latter don't like social media, nobody is forcing them to use it. Alas for the Californian billionaires (they tend to be Californian, and billionaires) who run these operations, my sense is that Britain's data regulator does not accept this argument. Elizabeth Denham - for that is her name - has a big call to make on the future of ad tech. Together with Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner who has hit Google with heavy fines for anti-competitive behaviour, and Elizabeth Warren, the Democrats' presidential hopeful in the US who wants to break up Big Tech, Denham, a Canadian, is at the forefront of attempts to re-balance power in the 21st century. Her decision is due in January. The whole world will be watching.

"The comedy drama, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper, received eight nominations in total. Steven Spielberg's drama Lincoln dominated the shortlist with 12, while Ang Lee's Life of Pi picked up 11. Nine films vie for the best picture award including action thriller Zero Dark Thirty, Argo and Les Miserables. The musical, which takes its lead from Victor Hugo's historical novel set during the Paris uprising, received eight nominations in total - including nods for stars Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway. Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained, Beasts of the Southern Wild and French language film Amour complete the list of best picture contenders. Tarantino told the BBC that Django Unchained, a western which sees Jamie Foxx as a freed slave on a mission to rescue his wife from a Mississippi plantation owner, would not win best picture, but said ""it's nice to be invited to the party"". The ceremony will take place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles on 24 February. Emmanuelle Riva and Quvenzhane Wallis are the oldest and youngest nominees in the best actress category at the age of 85 and nine respectively. Wallis, who was picked from obscurity to play the lead in Benh Zeitlin's Sundance winner Beasts of the Southern Wild, was just six when she took the role of a young girl stranded by rising waters and tending to a sick father in a remote corner of Louisiana. Riva, a respected film actress in France, plays a retired music teacher afflicted by a stroke in Michael Haneke's Amour, which won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last year. As well as both films appearing in the best film nominations, Haneke and newcomer Zeitlin won nominations in the best director category. They will face competition from Spielberg, Ang Lee and Silver Linings Playbook's David O Russell. But there was no nomination for Zero Dark Thirty's Kathryn Bigelow, who was named best director by the National Board of Review in the autumn and had been considered a frontrunner following nominations at the Baftas and the Golden Globes. Bigelow became the first woman to win the best director Oscar with The Hurt Locker at the Academy Awards in 2010. Tarantino also failed to secure a best director nomination. He told the BBC ""it bites a little bit, but I got it from Bafta"" - referring to his success in the Bafta nominations earlier this week. Britain's Tom Hooper - who was named best director for The King's Speech in 2011 - was also snubbed, for his work on Les Miserables. ""It was a complete shock,"" said Working Title's Eric Fellner. ""But not just for Tom, but also for Kathryn Bigelow for Zero Dark Thirty and Ben Affleck for Argo."" Prior to the nominations it had been suggested that Skyfall might become the first James Bond film to win a best picture nod. But the film was not shortlisted in any of the major categories, despite receiving Bafta nominations for Dame Judi Dench and Javier Bardem earlier this week. ""That's a great, great pity,"" Dame Judi told BBC Radio 4. ""I thought Sam Mendes directed it absolutely beautifully. I thought it was a wonderful story, and I thought it was very exciting."" However, Adele did win a place on the best song shortlist and said she felt ""like Meryl Streep"", while the film received a further four nominations in the technical categories. Aside from Riva and Wallis, the best actress category is completed by Jennifer Lawrence in Silver Linings Playbook, Naomi Watts in The Impossible and Jessica Chastain, who plays a CIA agent hunting Osama Bin Laden in Zero Dark Thirty. Watts is the only nomination for The Impossible, the real-life story of a family caught up in the devastating 2004 tsunami. The actress said she was ""truly honoured"". ""I am so thrilled and humbled with this morning's wonderful news,"" she said. ""The journey of telling Maria Belon's miraculous story of survival has been an incredible experience."" Previous Oscar winner Dame Helen Mirren missed out on a best actress nomination for Hitchcock, which leaves Daniel Day-Lewis as the key British hope at this year's ceremony. The 55-year-old is currently the bookmakers' favourite to win the best actor award for his role as US president Abraham Lincoln. Should he win he will become the first actor to win the best actor honour three times, after earlier triumphs with There Will Be Blood (2008) and My Left Foot (1989). Bradley Cooper, best known for the Hangover films, is among his competition, which also includes Hugh Jackman for Les Miserables, Joaquin Phoenix in Paul Thomas Anderson's cult drama The Master and former winner Denzel Washington, as an alcoholic pilot in Flight. There were no British contenders in the supporting categories. All five supporting actors, including Silver Linings' Robert De Niro, Argo's Alan Arkin, Philip Seymour Hoffman in The Master, Christoph Waltz in Django Unchained and Lincoln's Tommy Lee Jones, have won Oscars previously. Anne Hathaway leads the supporting actress category for her role as the tragic Fantine, with competition from Amy Adams in The Master, Sally Field in Lincoln, Helen Hunt in The Sessions and Australia's Jacki Weaver in Silver Linings Playbook. Animated film The Pirates! Band of Misfits (also known as The Pirates! In An Adventure with Scientists!) may also bring British success for Aardman Animations - of Wallace and Gromit fame - who have previously won four Oscars. Producer Peter Lord called the nomination ""amazing"". ""We tried to do something a little different with The Pirates!, in terms of tone and comedy, and it's just brilliant that the Academy has responded to it in such a wonderful way."" The Oscars ceremony, which will feature a tribute to 50 years of the James Bond movie franchise, will be hosted by Seth MacFarlane, who created the animated series Family Guy. The star, who is hosting for the first time, also secured an Oscar nomination on Thursday for best song, having written the lyrics for Everybody Needs A Best Friend from the movie Ted.",Silver Linings Playbook has become the first film to win Oscar nominations in all four acting categories for more than 30 years.
"Gray, 75, will play Tabitha, aka Tabby, the mother of Lysette Anthony's Marnie Nightingale character. ""I'm thrilled to be going from one iconic series to another,"" said Gray, promising Tabby would ""whip up a storm just like Sue Ellen did"". Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said she was ""an international TV icon"". 'Perfect fit' ""When we came to discuss who could possibly play Marnie's mother the list was very small,"" he explained in a statement. ""Lysette Anthony has fast become a fabulous soap bitch, so having Linda Gray play her mother Tabitha is the perfect fit."" Gray made her first appearance as Sue Ellen in the very first episode of Dallas in 1978 and went on to appear in more than 300 episodes of the series. She went on to reprise the character - famously described by Larry Hagman's JR as ""a drunk, a tramp and an unfit mother"" - when the show was revived in 2012. Two of Gray's new colleagues, actors Jessica Ellis and Kieron Richardson, dropped a hint about her impending arrival earlier in a conspiratorial message on Twitter.

"The late actor played the villain Toecutter, opposite Mel Gibson, in the 1979 post-apocalyptic, dystopian action movie. British filmmaker Brian Trenchard-Smith confirmed on Facebook that he had died on Tuesday. Charlize Theron, who appeared with him in the fourth instalment and 2015 re-boot, Fury Road, said he would be ""deeply missed"". ""It's amazing you were able to play an evil warlord so well cause you were such a kind, beautiful soul,"" Theron posted online. Keays-Byrne was born in India to British parents and moved to England as a child. A production of A Midsummer Night's Dream took him to Australia in 1973, where he settled. After appearing in the original Mad Max, which was made Down Under, director George Miller brought him back for Fury Road, where he played the antagonist Immortan Joe. In a 2015 interview with The Independent, he said he had been ""pleasantly surprised"" to get the call again. And explained that while his original character, Toecutter, had been a member of an ""oppressed nomadic minority"", Immortan Joe was ""a renaissance man"". ""He's simply trying to bring order into an apocalyptic world"" said Keays-Byrne. 'Generous heart' Trenchard-Smith, who directed him in the 1975 action film, The Man From Hong Kong, called him ""a fine actor and a good friend"". ""Hugh had a generous heart, offering a helping hand to people in need, or a place to stay to a homeless teenager,"" he posted. ""He cared about social justice and preserving the environment long before these issues became fashionable."" He added: ""His life was governed by his sense of the oneness of humanity. We will miss his example and his friendship."" Keays-Byrne also appeared in the 1974 biker movie Stone and the 1986 drama, For Love Alone.

"The couple apologised after they were caught kissing in public - Walsh had a long-term girlfriend and Jones is married to another dancer on the show. ""My take was keep them in the show, make them do the 'dance of shame,'"" Craig told ITV's Jonathan Ross show. ""Get on with the job and show people what you're made of,"" he added. ""It's really important that if this does happen to you, you face up to it and you... as they've done, apologise... and show people, 'Ok, this is what I did, I've been employed to do this job, I'm going to... get on with it and do it well and do it professionally.'"" Asked about the so-called 'Strictly curse', which claims the BBC One show has caused several relationship break-ups, Craig said ""there has to be something wrong in your relationship"" in the first place for it to go off the rails while on Strictly. Fellow judge Darcey Bussell concurred: ""I danced for over 20 years in the Royal Ballet and I'm still happily married."" Craig said he had wanted to see Seann and Katya do the rumba, which is thought to have been their original dance for this Saturday. ""I wanted to see the rumba, the dance of love, I'm sure everyone wants to see that. That's one of my favourite dances, as well."" Asked whether they could see any chemistry with Seann and Katya in particular, Craig said: ""There was a mild improvement [in their dance last weekend] from the week before but I would not put that down to a snog at the back of a pub, if that's what you're asking. I would put it down to hard work and having to act through the dance and tell that story."" The judges were asked whether they felt the public might vote Seann and Katya off the show following the controversy.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter ""Unless you shake hands and send gifts, there's no nomination considerations. Next year I'll send you a basket of confectionery,"" the star tweeted. Malik has never been nominated, either as a solo act or with One Direction. Malik's latest album wasn't eligible for this year's Grammys because it came out after the cut-off date in August. In a subsequent tweet, the British singer clarified that his comments were ""not personal or about eligibility"". Instead, he said he was concerned ""about the need for inclusion and the lack of transparency of the nomination process"", saying the current system and ""allows favouritism, racism, and networking politics to influence the voting"". His comments echo those of The Weeknd, who accused Grammys organisers of being ""corrupt"" after he was snubbed in this year's nominations. The star's hit single Blinding Lights has now spent a record-breaking 52 weeks in the US top 10, and he was widely expected to be among the main contenders. Instead, he was overlooked in all 84 categories. The Canadian singer, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, called it ""an attack"". ""I'm not a cocky person. I'm not arrogant. People told me I was going to get nominated. The world told me,"" he told Billboard magazine. ""We were all very confused."" 'Serious irregularities' The Grammys voting procedure is notoriously complex, with review committees having the final say in 72 categories - meaning they can overrule the votes of rank-and-file members. Last year, the chief executive of the Recording Academy - which organises the ceremony - claimed to have evidence of ""serious"" irregularities in the voting. Deborah Dugan made her claims after being placed on administrative leave after allegations of misconduct. She said her removal was retaliation for speaking up against misconduct within the organisation, including sexual harassment and corrupt voting procedures. Malik has had a turbulent history with the Grammys, after being disqualified from the best new artist category in 2017 because of his prior success with One Direction. ""This was actually pretty clear cut,"" Bill Freimuth, chief awards officer at the Recording Academy, said at the time. Malik's duet with Taylor Swift, I Don't Wanna Live Forever, from the movie Fifty Shades Darker, did receive a nomination for best song written for visual media in 2018. However, that award recognises the songwriters (in this case Swift, Jack Antonoff and Sam Dew) rather than the performers. The star's third album, Nobody Is Listening, which came out in January, will be eligible for consideration next year. However, it failed to make the US top 40. The 63rd Grammys Ceremony will take place in Los Angeles on Sunday, with special staging to adapt to the pandemic era. The show will feature four stages, each with a small group of performers, nominees and guests, plus a fifth stage for presenters. The stages have been arranged in a circle, while a reduced crew will stand in the centre to film the proceedings. Beyoncé leads the nominations with nine in total, including four for Black Parade, a protest anthem released at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests last summer. Dua Lipa and Taylor Swift both have six nominations - with Swift hopeful of winning album of the year for a record-breaking third time for her first lockdown album Folklore. Performers on the night will include Cardi B, BTS, Doja Cat, Billie Eilish, Haim, Megan Thee Stallion and Malik's former bandmate Harry Styles, who is nominated for three awards.

Previously, all four coaches had said they would only reprise their roles if if they could continue doing it together. BBC controller Mark Linsey said O'Donoghue was ""an absolute star"" but understands he has to focus on his music career. ""The Voice coaches are all current music stars with recording and touring careers to manage alongside the show and we know this can be difficult to juggle,"" he added. The Script's latest album #3, which was released in September 2012, reached number two in the UK album chart. ""My focus will be on The Script moving forward as we are about to embark on the most important part of our career as a band,"" O'Donoghue said.

"The track is a collaboration with Burna Boy and Ed Sheeran, and earns Stormzy his third UK number one in 12 months, knocking Ellie Goulding off the top. But it follows a Twitter spat this week between Stormzy and fellow rapper Wiley over the song. Wiley criticised Stormzy for working with Sheeran, whom he had once said was using grime music to gain ""clout"". And he suggested that the only reason Jay-Z wanted to work with Stormzy on a different track was because of his association with Sheeran. Speaking to Radio 1's Scott Mills about Wiley, Stormzy said: ""I don't think we'll be meeting up anytime soon. I think he just gets a bit 'woop' and then he hits the old social media. Obviously, when you get 'wooped' you're not meant to tweet. ""It's like a drunk uncle, it's like 'aw uncle, come on man... get back to bed'."" Stormzy added he felt bad that Sheeran was being dragged into the online argument. ""This is why it's even worse, because Ed's the kindest, nicest soul ever. He's just trying to travel the world and he's probably getting notifications,"" he explained. ""But I said 'don't worry I'll do all the trolling'. I don't mind trolling Wiley, he loves it."" Stormzy's previous number ones in the UK include Vossi Bop and Take Me Back To London, the latter another collaboration with Sheeran, The last British rapper to score three chart-topping singles in the space of 12 months was Dizzee Rascal more than a decade ago. He landed a trio of chart-toppers with Holiday, Dirtee Disco and Shout between September 2009 and June 2010.","Stormzy has scored the first number one of the decade, as his song Own It climbs to the top of the singles chart."
"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The singer was widely praised for her performance as Eurydice in a raunchy production of Orpheus in the Underworld at the Salzburg Festival in Austria. But some reviewers went further and criticised her appearance, calling her ""fat"", ""stocky-looking"" and ""buxom"". Speaking to the BBC, Lewek called the comments ""antiquated"" and ""ridiculous"". She said her role in Orpheus in the Underworld was clearly a sexualised one (""she has sex with everyone on stage"") so she had been prepared for ""some comments"". But the soprano, who recently gave birth, was stunned to read reviews that she said critiqued her ""postpartum mom-bod instead of reviewing the show"". 'Juvenile bullies' One column in particular ""really lit my fire"", she said. Written by Manuel Brug in German broadsheet Die Welt, it described Lewek and her fellow cast members as ""fat women in tight corsets spreading their legs"". Lewek said: ""It was such a derogatory way of describing what my character was all about."" Without naming Brug, she lashed out at ""body-shaming and fat-shaming"" on Twitter, writing: ""Time's up on these juvenile bullies."" Brug later responded, writing: ""If she is so sensitive why is she showing herself the whole time in this corset? It is interesting that the thin ladies on stage all had dresses and the not so thin ones have costumes where you see a lot of her weight."" His comments sparked a furious backlash from other singers. ""This is absolutely disgraceful,"" wrote British tenor Anthony Gregory. ""Why is it 'interesting' that all the 'thin ladies' on stage had dresses? Was that a disappointment? So sorry you're having to put up with it Kathryn."" ""Commenting on anything that is unrelated to the performance is irrelevant,"" added Brit Award-winner Camilla Kerslake, noting that ""male singers rarely have to put up with this"". ""This is [a] representation of how our society and the media have gone way off course in analyzing real beauty and art - and that's devastating,"" said violinist Emily Madonia. Lewek subsequently wrote to the editor of Die Welt imploring the paper to ""set higher standards of quality and decency for your employees"". In response, the paper's editor, Dr Ulf Poschardt, said Brug's review had been misinterpreted. ""This report was not meant as a personal insult - and it is not written as a personal insult,"" he said. ""What Manuel Brug did attack though, was Barrie Kosky's stage-direction - and his view on woman expressed in this stage-direction. These aesthetics might be called misogynist, not Mr. Brug's clear words about [them]."" 'Not ashamed' Born and raised in Connecticut, Lewek has established herself as one of her generation's strongest coloratura sopranos, performing with the The Metropolitan Opera, Opera Leipzig, English National Opera and as a soloist at the BBC Proms. Although she has ""gone up and down in weight over the course of my life"", the singer said the recent reviews were ""the first time I have ever been a target"" of comments about her size. ""At first I just wanted to ignore it all,"" she said, but changed her mind when other performers, including Deborah Voigt and Jessica Pratt, contacted her to say they had faced similar criticisms. ""The outpouring of support, and people telling their stories to me made me realise this is something I need to talk about,"" she said. ""I'm not ashamed of how I look, I've got a thick skin, and it felt like an opportunity for me to help my community - because it's unacceptable. It's not good journalism."" The response has encouraged her to keep the campaign going, and she plans to speak at a summit of the Parent Artist Advocacy League in New York later this year. Besides, she said, the Salzburg critics missed a vital point about her post-baby physique. ""I think I'm singing better than I've ever sung and, honestly, the extra weight I put on when I had my daughter has actually helped,"" she said. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Emma SaundersEntertainment reporter For his latest series, the 93-year-old - who has been shielding - had to record some of his voiceovers from his home in south-west London. ""I'm very lucky, I don't have a huge garden... I live in suburban Richmond-upon-Thames but I have a reasonable-sized garden and it has a pond. I've lived here about 60 years."" But anyone tuning into BBC One's Perfect Planet will feel as far away from London as it is possible to be. The five-part series transports viewers to numerous parts of the world including the tidal islands of the Bahamas, Kamchatka in Russia and the Galapagos Islands. Not particularly unusual for a Sir David documentary, you might think. But this time, the focus is on how the forces of nature - weather, ocean currents, solar energy and volcanoes - drive and support life on earth, and how wildlife adapts to whatever the environment throws at it. The opener looks at the impact of volcanoes, featuring the inhospitable but vast breeding ground for the lesser flamingo at Lake Natron in Tanzania, in the shadow of the active volcano, Ol Doinyo Lengai (Mountain of God). Filmed by drone for the first time, the episode homes in on the intimate scene of these leggy birds laying their eggs on tiny nests built on the highly caustic soda flats of the lake. Later, the chicks tentatively emerge and begin to find their feet. ""That flamingo sequence is one of the most incredible sequences I've seen on television. It's been filmed so beautifully, the use of drones - it's so skilful, the pictures are indelibly planted in the mind. It's extraordinary,"" says Sir David. Unsurprisingly, filming in such a harsh environment wasn't easy. The soda flats are pretty inaccessible, says Matt Aeberhard, one of Perfect Planet's camera operators. ""More people had landed on the moon until fairly recently than had landed on the flats. It's a highly caustic environment. The pH there is about 12 - not far off household bleach. The only option to get there is a hovercraft, which was fun but the rubber skirt is shredded by the jagged soda crystals."" The Maasai people who live nearby pitch in to help stitch the rubber back together. And more local film crews were used to reduce the carbon footprint. The series aims to demonstrate how the most dangerous of natural forces are also essential to life on our planet. There are 1,500 active volcanoes worldwide and we wouldn't be here without them, says series producer Huw Cordey. ""They are effectively the architects of the planet."" Without them, we'd have no breathable atmosphere - no oceans and no land. To demonstrate the point, we are also treated to scenes of land iguanas on the Galapagos Islands gingerly clambering down to a volcano floor to lay their eggs. But filming such scenes isn't without risk and there was one accident during the series. Skin graft ""We were filming the geysers in Kamchatka,"" says Cordey, ""and one of the camera operators stepped back into a small pool of boiling water. He burnt his shin and carried on for a week but ended up having a skin graft."" And while natural forces may be dangerous to humans, the series inevitably concludes with an episode focused on the opposite - the impact of our behaviour on those natural forces. It's very timely given the extreme weather events in US, says executive producer Alastair Fothergill. ""It's no longer enough to make purely celebratory nature programmes. But there are solutions. With the political will we can turn this around."" Sir David agrees: ""I keep reminding myself, we have three times the amount of humans as when I first started making TV. We can sort it out if we all behave in certain ways but to start with you have to recognise the problem."" With that in mind, his thoughts turn to the recent election in the US. ""America is the most powerful country in the world and has a huge influence,"" he says during our Zoom interview, telling of his delight at Joe Biden's pledge to re-join the Paris climate agreement. Sir David demonstrates his joyful reaction on hearing President-elect Biden's statement. ""I did this! (Sir David gets up, raises his hands in the air and cheers). I can't ever remember getting out of my seat and cheering - I've never done it before!"" And what does he think of our own government's recently announced 10-point climate plan? ""It won't go far enough, no plan would ever go far enough. We are facing a real crisis, this is not just talk or fantasy. If we heat the earth so the Arctic melts, every city will be under water. Most cities are near the coast. ""But we've still got a chance to stop it happening. You have to say there's a strong element in the US that don't believe in it, including the current president (of the US)."" Christmas waste Speaking of his own influence, Sir David says he mistrusts ""too much personality"". ""I'm sure Greta [Thunberg] would say the same. We understand a personal statement is more powerful. Greta says it all the time: 'It's not me, it's the science and the scientists we should listen to'."" Even he says he could do more when it comes to waste, especially at Christmas. ""Wrapping paper - I'm as guilty as anyone. The guy who collects refuse from our house will probably say the same."" He says the coronavirus pandemic has made us ""realise our dependency on the natural world"". ""The extravagance of Christmas is out of place at this particular moment."" And is there anywhere he hasn't been that he would like to visit when travelling is back on the menu? ""Central Asia, the Gobi - but there are no animals there, just fossils, so I'm not likely to be sent!"" Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

It is the second time the power couple have hit the road together, following 2014's On The Run Tour - which was launched with a video depicting the couple as bank robbers trying to evade the police (a riff on their joint single '03 Bonnie & Clyde). The show allowed the stars, who have been married since 2008, to present a united front after TMZ released footage of Jay-Z being attacked by Beyonce's younger sister, Solange, in an elevator following the Met Ball. Since then, however, the stars have both released confessional albums - Lemonade for Beyonce and 4:44 for Jay-Z - in which they acknowledged a troubled period in their marriage, triggered by Jay-Z's infidelity. The duo last appeared on stage together during Beyonce's triumphant headline set at the Coachella music festival in California.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Here's everything you need to know about the 60th annual Grammy Awards, which take place in New York on Sunday. When are the Grammys? The ceremony takes place on Sunday, 28 January. If you're in the US, you can watch it live on CBS from 7:30pm (ET) / 4:30pm (PT). In the UK, you have to wait until 4Music screens a highlights show at 7pm on Monday night. However, you can watch red carpet coverage live on E! (151 on Sky, 156 on Virgin, 321 on BT) from 10:30pm on Sunday. And BBC Music News LIVE will be bringing you all the action as it happens, throughout the night. Who's performing? Who isn't? In alphabetical order we have... And that's not all... There are usually a few surprises on the night itself. I heard some stars are boycotting the show... Gossip site Hits Daily Double recently claimed Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Lorde and Justin Timberlake would SENSATIONALLY boycott the Grammys because they're FURIOUS at being SNUBBED. In the past, artists like Frank Ocean, Jay-Z and Kanye West have avoided the ceremony over a perceived racial bias; so a similar movement by white pop artists (some of whom have been accused of appropriating black culture) would be misguided at best. A more likely explanation is that the story is rubbish. What do you mean? While it's true that several stars are missing from the seating plan, most of them have legitimate reasons for missing the ceremony. Justin Timberlake is busy rehearsing his Super Bowl half-time show, for example. And Taylor Swift's latest record, Reputation, isn't eligible for the awards until next year. As for chart-bothering pop megasaur Ed Sheeran? He's only nominated in the pop categories, which are handed out in an earlier, non-televised ceremony. So he might as well stay at home and get a takeaway. On the other hand, Drake is actually boycotting the show. The Canadian star refused to submit his music for consideration after the Grammys relegated him to the rap categories last year. The Canadian star said he felt ""alienated"" by organisers ""putting me in that category, cos it's the only place you can figure out where to put me"". ""Maybe because I've rapped in the past or because I'm black, I can't figure out why."" Will #TimesUp be reflected? Absolutely. Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, Dua Lipa, Rita Ora and others plan to wear white roses to the ceremony to support the #TimesUp movement, which was launched in response to the sexual harassment scandals that have rocked the entertainment world. Pop star Kesha will also perform Praying - a song that addresses her relationship with producer Dr Luke, who she claims verbally, physically and sexually assaulted her (charges he denies). ""We are going to do something a little bit different with it,"" said Ken Ehrlich, who has overseen the Grammys ceremony since 1980. ""I think people will come away with the sense that we are supporting or allowing the artist to make a statement,"" he told Yahoo news. ""So, I think that the thing that we have to be careful about is letting the show turn into an issue-oriented show that loses sight of the fact of what winning a Grammy means."" Who'll win the big prizes? Sure, they look all friendly here - but the big battle for album of the year is between elder statesman of hip-hop Jay-Z and his younger competitor Kendrick Lamar. The smart money's on Kendrick, whose incendiary, virtuoso album DAMN topped most critics' lists last year - but there's a danger Jay-Z will split the hip-hop vote, allowing Bruno Mars or Lorde to swoop in and steal the prize. Best new artist looks like a two-way tie between SZA and Khalid, whose confessional lyrics broached new ground; while Luis Fonsi's Despacito could repeat its success at the Latin Grammys with a win for song of the year. Who else is nominated? There are 84 categories at the Grammys - including ""best regional Mexican music album"" and ""best historical album"" - so pretty much everyone gets a nod (except Katy Perry, who got zilch). In terms of volume, Jay Z has the most nominations - eight in total - followed by Kendrick Lamar and Bruno Mars, who have have seven and six respectively. Childish Gambino, Khalid, No ID and SZA have five apiece. You can see the main nominees on this page, or read the full, exhaustive list on the official Grammy website. What? Nothing for Beyonce? Technically, no. The star, who's the reigning queen of the Grammys, with 20 trophies to date, didn't release anything during the eligibility period. But she does appear on Jay-Z's track Family Feud, which is nominated for Best Rap/Sung Performance. Anything else to watch out for? Cardi B could become the first female rapper to win best rap song, if her massive US number one Bodak Yellow triumphs in that category. The late Carrie Fisher appears on the shortlist for best spoken word album; for the witty recording of her memoir, The Princess Diarist. There are also posthumous nominations for Leonard Cohen, Chris Cornell and Greg Allman. What about tributes? There'll be a salute to Tom Petty, who died last October; while Gary Clark Jr will perform a set honouring rock pioneers Chuck Berry and Fats Domino. Meanwhile, country stars Maren Morris, Eric Church, and the Brothers Osborne will pay tribute to ""the victims lost to gun violence and terrorism at various live music events over the course of the past year"". All three played at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas last October, where a gunman opened fire, killing 58 concert-goers. Who's hosting? James Corden is back in charge of the Grammys after a well-received performance last year - including a spectacular fall down the stairs. ""We're just going to try and arrive with some little bits of fun,"" he told CBS, ""because most award shows, let's be honest, are groups of millionaires giving each other statues. ""The Grammys is different than that because the Grammys is all about the performances. It's all about the music."" What's the difference between song of the year and record of the year? Song of the year goes to the people who wrote the music and lyrics. Record of the year recognises everyone who contributed - singers, musicians, producers, janitors, receptionists, pizza delivery boys, people who sued to get their name added to the credits, Simon Cowell, pet dogs, Simon Cowell's pet dogs, ex-boyfriends and estranged aunts (ft Migos). Who has won the most Grammys? In a single night, the record haul is eight awards. Michael Jackson did it first in 1984, followed by Santana in 2000. But conductor Georg Solti holds the overall record, with 31 wins between 1962 and 1997. Quincy Jones and Alison Krauss are tied for second place, with 27 trophies. Interestingly, Krauss could finally break that tie this year, as her album Windy City has earned two nominations: Country solo performance for the track Losing You and American roots performance for I Never Cared For You.

"That's a line from Naomi Alderman's book The Power, the only novel to appear on this year's longlist for the Orwell Book Prize for political writing. It imagines a world in which almost every woman suddenly develops the ability to electrocute people at will - ""from a tiny tingle all the way to full electro-death"". On her website, Alderman says her ""feminist science-fiction"" novel explores what would happen if women had the power to cause pain and destruction. 'Clear and calm perspective' on Britain Fourteen books in total - including works on Brexit, FGM and the impact of the Hillsborough disaster - are in the running for the £3,000 award. The prize is named after George Orwell, whose dystopian classic 1984 re-entered the book charts earlier this year. Other books on the list include All Out War, Tim Shipman's contemporary history of the EU referendum campaign; and Black and British, in which David Olusoga charts the long relationship between the British Isles and the people of Africa. Also in the running is Hibo Wardere's memoir Cut, about female genital mutilation in Britain. Revealing the longlist, the judges said it offered ""a clear and calm perspective on Britain and its place in the world"".

"The actor, 59, was granted a temporary restraining order against Linda Ransom last month after she repeatedly went to his home. A Los Angeles judge ordered her to stay 100 yards (91 metres) away from Mr Goldblum for the next three years. The 49-year-old claims she is trying to pursue a case against one of his employees, who she says attacked her. She claims although she has tried to file the case, she has been unable to find a lawyer willing to represent her. Ms Ransom, who repeatedly raised her voice to the judge, told the court: ""Mr Goldblum is being harassed because the legal system is negligently violating my rights."" The judge told her it did not give her the right to repeatedly go to the star's home and try to meet him at public performances. ""This harassment is going to stop. Mr Goldblum does not want you near him,"" the judge said. Mr Goldblum did not appear in court, but provided a sworn testimony detailing Ms Ransom's alleged behaviour. ""Over the past decade, I have experienced substantial emotional distress due to Ms Ransom's continuous stalking, harassing, and threatening behaviour,"" he wrote. Mr Goldblum, the star of films including The Fly and Independence Day, says he first alerted police to her in 2001 after she attended one of his acting classes and began waiting outside his home. His testimony also stated Ms Ransom had been arrested three times for violating previous restraining orders and had been placed in psychiatric care. The actor previously won a restraining order against her in 2007.",A woman who has harassed Jeff Goldblum for the past decade has been ordered to stay away from the Jurassic Park star.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Now three new acts are vying for the title as the prize marks its 10th anniversary. Pop diva Dua Lipa, blues singer Rag N Bone Man and dance vocalist Anne-Marie all make the shortlist, which is voted for by music industry experts. The winner is announced on 8 December, ahead of next year's Brit Awards. Unusually, all of this year's nominees have already tasted chart success in the last 12 months. Anne-Marie is currently number one as the featured performer on Clean Bandit's hit Rockabye. Dua Lipa, who was on the BBC's Sound Of 2016 list earlier this year, has scored hits with her singles Hotter Than Hell and Blow Your Mind (Mwah). Rag N Bone Man, meanwhile, has been number one for nine weeks in Germany with his soul-stirring ballad Human. The song is set to enter the UK chart for the first time this week after being performed by X Factor contestant Emily Middlemas. The nominees were chosen by a panel of music industry experts - from critics and record label employees to heads of the UK's biggest radio stations. The winner will receive a statue designed by late architect Zaha Hadid, and will get to perform on the Brit Awards launch show live on ITV on 14 January. Before they become ubiquitous, brush up on the nominees below. Anne-Marie After two stints in Les Miserables as a child actress, Anne-Marie was hired as a touring vocalist for dance collective Rudimental. They liked her so much they signed her to their label. Her solo single Alarm hit number 16 earlier this year and has been streamed more than 100 million times. Age: 25 From: Essex Inspired by: Eminem, 50 Cent, Prince, Lauryn Hill and... S Club 7 For fans of: Rihanna, Jess Glynne, Jessie Ware Did you know? Anne-Marie is a three-time world karate champion. She says: ""I actually can't believe I am nominated for this amazing award. This is so sick. To everyone who voted for me I am so grateful and humbled, here's to 2017!"" Dua Lipa Born in London but with an Albanian heritage, Dua Lipa attended the Sylvia Young stage school until, aged 13, her parents returned to Kosovo. She lasted two years before fleeing to London, where she worked in nightclubs to pay for her singing career. Possessed of a smoky voice and a hip-hop sensibility, she is due to release her debut album in February. Age: 21 From: London Inspired by: Chance The Rapper, David Bowie, Nelly Furtado, Pink For fans of: Destiny's Child, Lana Del Rey, Charli XCX Did you know?

Rag N Bone Man Born Rory Graham, singer-songwriter Rag N Bone Man is the unlikely missing link between blues giants like Robert Johnson and the soulful pop of Sam Smith and John Newman. His gruff, emotive voice brings his tales of love, loss and redemption vividly to life - something his huge European fanbase have cottoned on to before the UK.

"By Tom BrookBBC News, Utah More than 100 full-length features are being screened at the 11-day festival, featuring such stars as Al Pacino, Katie Holmes, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Spacey, Tobey Maguire, Demi Moore and Sigourney Weaver. Sundance, which takes place in the relatively small winter ski resort of Park City in Utah, has its own unique charms for stars accustomed to the international film festival circuit. Paul Giamatti, who'll be starring in high-school wrestling drama Win Win, says what sets the festival apart is ""the insanity of it - the fact that everybody is crammed into a little street in the middle of Utah."" With some 20 British films in the line-up, there's a strong UK presence at the festival this year. Ewan McGregor, Hugh Dancy, Alex Kingston and Freddie Highmore are among the British actors in Sundance films. British directors are making an impact too. Kevin Macdonald, who directed The Last King of Scotland, has masterminded Life in a Day, one of the most ambitious and eagerly awaited Sundance films. It's a global cinematic project, supported by YouTube and built from user-generated content drawn from 80,000 people. All the images seen in the film were shot on a single day - 24 July 2010. Magical kingdom Another British director, James Marsh, has also been the subject of pre-festival talk with his documentary, Project Nim. Marsh, who won an Oscar in 2009 for his film Man On Wire, explores an experiment which aimed to prove that a chimpanzee - if raised like a human baby - could communicate through sign language. There's also interest in Becoming Chaz, co-produced by British film-maker Fenton Bailey. The documentary chronicles Cher's daughter Chastity and her transition to becoming a man through gender reassignment. Sundance is guided by director and actor Robert Redford, one of the festival's founding fathers. To many independent film-makers, he has created a magical kingdom in the snowy mountains of Utah. ""It's one of the only places left where you can have this huge community of people come and just celebrate smaller films,"" says Alex Stapleton, who's coming to Sundance with her documentary on maverick film-maker Robert Corman. ""Films that otherwise may not even be seen anywhere else."" Something different Another Sundance supporter is Hollywood film-maker Rob Minkoff, He'll be at the festival with Flypaper, an independent film starring Patrick Dempsey and Ashley Judd. For Minkoff, who made his name largely by directing mainstream movies, it is an opportunity to do something fresh. ""When you work in the business, particularly if you're doing studio movies, you can kind of get typecast or pigeon-holed to do things people expect from you,"" he says. ""Doing this movie was an opportunity for me to do something I liked, but not necessarily something people would expect or want to pay me for."" John Cooper, the festival's programming director, believes Sundance is a vital place. ""I love the amount of lives that we get to affect,"" he says. ""It's a big career move for a film-maker to get into Sundance. ""I'm excited about our history of seeing a film-maker come with a short five or 10 years ago, and then come back with a feature, sometimes a small feature and then a bigger feature."" But the festival's cheerleaders cannot ignore the sobering underlying realities. These are still extremely tough times for independent cinema. The recession has hit the industry hard, there is still no solid business model independent film-makers can embrace and the vast majority of films screened at Sundance will leave the festival without a distribution deal. Yet Sundance nearly always yields winners. It's helped to launch the careers of some of the biggest names in cinema, from directors like Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino to actresses like Britain's Carey Mulligan. Several films that are contenders in the current awards season - The Kids are All Right, Blue Valentine and British documentary Restrepo - were all screened at last year's Sundance. So there is always reason for hope for Sundance attendees that their work will be discovered in Park City and lead to bigger success in the outside world. The Sundance Film Festival runs from 20 to 30 January.","Big names from the world of cinema are en route to this year's Sundance Film Festival, one of the world's leading showcases of independent film."
"The actor will play Vote Leave's campaign director Dominic Cummings. The two-hour drama, which has a working title of Brexit, has been written by political dramatist James Graham. Channel 4 said it would ""explore the myriad tactics employed to swing one of the most surprising referendum results in living memory"". Vote Leave was the official ""out"" campaign during the 2016 EU referendum and was backed by cabinet ministers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Most of the drama's action will take place during the build-up to the vote and ""will explore the anatomy of a modern data-driven election campaign, and the divisive figures driving it from the shadows"", Channel 4 said. The broadcaster said the drama would set out ""not to be an analysis of who was right and who was wrong, but rather is the story of how it happened, and why"". During the campaign, Cumberbatch himself signed a letter saying Brexit would ""damage"" the creative industry. Mr Cummings was one of the referendum's leading strategists, and has said the ""out"" campaign probably would not have won without the famous bus pledging an extra £350m a week for the NHS. He hasn't commented on Channel 4's plans, but he has been at loggerheads with Channel 4 News over their reporting of Vote Leave's spending during the referendum. The group's spending is currently being investigated by the Electoral Commission. Vote Leave has also come under scrutiny for its Facebook campaign after it enlisted a data firm that may have improperly received users' data. Vote Leave has denied any wrongdoing. Dramatist Graham penned the script for Coalition, a 2015 Channel 4 docudrama about the aftermath of the 2010 general election. He also created political stage dramas including This House, Labour of Love and Privacy. Graham said: ""I'm so excited - not to mention a little nervous - to have this chance to try and get under the skin of what happened during that historic vote. ""I hope by going behind the scenes of the campaign, we're able to interrogate the consequences of what happened during these eight weeks that have changed the country forever."" Graham's retelling of the EU referendum is likely to prove contentious, partly because disputes about how the campaign was conducted are still raging. Mr Cummings has been summoned to appear in front of the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee on Tuesday to answer questions about Vote Leave's spending, use of personal data and co-ordination with other pro-Brexit groups. But he has accused the MPs of being more interested in grandstanding than uncovering the truth, and has said he will not give evidence to the committee ""under any circumstances"". More new Channel 4 shows Alongside the Cumberbatch-led drama, Channel 4 has announced more new programmes. They include a late-night entertainment show hosted by grime star Big Narstie and stand-up comedian Mo Gilligan, and filmed in front of a live studio audience. The pair will be joined by celebrity guests to dissect popular culture and trends. Channel 4's new director of programmes Ian Katz described the series, given the working title The Big Narstie Show, as ""frankly bonkers"". Set to air at 11pm, it fills a slot earmarked by Katz as a space space for ""outlandish ideas"". Meanwhile, a new reality show, The Circle, will ask ""provocative questions"" about interaction in the age of social media. Contestants will live in separate apartments and only be able to communicate anonymously online through The Circle - a voice-activated social media platform. ""It is only when someone is 'blocked' that the others will learn about who they have really been interacting with,"" the broadcaster said.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter ""I'm literally one of those old women going, 'Where's the camera? Is this thing on?'"" The star is speaking from her home in LA where, in reality, she's become something of a technological ninja. In the space of just six weeks, she's planning to write and record a new album from scratch, with only the ""tools I have at my fingertips to create all music, all artwork, all videos… everything"". The 27-year-old is already one of the most respected songwriters in pop, known for hits like Boys, 1999, Boom Clap and her Icona Pop collaboration I Love It. But this time around, she's making the writing process completely transparent - posting lyric ideas to Twitter, playing demos on Instagram live and sharing early drafts on her Apple Music radio show. Not only that, but she's screen-grabbing texts from her producers, crowd-sourcing ideas in mass-participation Zoom calls, and getting fans to create artwork, videos and remixes. ""Part of me is like, 'I don't know why I haven't made an album like this before',"" she says. ""It's so fun and nice to work like this."" Announcing the project on 6 April, Charli told fans her ""positivity goes hand-in-hand with being creative,"" but that doesn't mean she's immune to difficult days. ""Yesterday I cried,"" she admitted in a video this week. ""I was feeling I was asking too much of everyone - pushing people to make stuff during quarantine when maybe some people just want to chill."" But so far, the results rank amongst the singer's best work. The first two singles, Forever and Claws, effortlessly combine her dual instincts for crisp pop melodies and adventurous, corrosive production. She hopes to have the rest of the album, tentatively titled How I'm Feeling Now, available on streaming services in just three weeks' time. When our Zoom connection finally stabilised, Charli flopped down on a beanbag to discuss how the record was shaping up. Hey Charli! How are you? Actually, I feel quite good right now. I definitely have days where I'm just like, ""Oh My God, I feel so unproductive and lost,"" but generally, I'm quite surprised at how I'm handling this time. The rest of us are getting a taste of life on tour: No-one knows what day of the week it is. I definitely have that feeling too. I'll be like, ""Oh my God, it's Friday!"" and someone will go, ""Er, no, it was Friday four days ago."" What would you have been doing now if you weren't making this record? I'd be really, really struggling. Binge-watching TV and being actually quite sad. How daunting has it been to share all your drafts lyrics and demo vocals? It's quite exposing, definitely - but the second I started doing it, I didn't find it scary any more. And that's not because all my ideas are great. Some of my ideas, even the ones I'm posting, are things that maybe won't come into full realisation. But I think, for my fans, it's really nice for them to see the process. I mean, I'd be interested to hear demos from some of my favourite artists, to feel their ideas as they're forming. I find it exciting. On your Apple Music show, you played a demo where the lyrics were mostly nonsense words, as you felt your way around the melody. But you kept going back to one line: ""I know you can't leave me alone"". Do you think that phrase will stick? It's different every time. That line you mentioned, I'm quite confidently singing it by the end and often, with a situation like that, I would definitely consider basing the song around that phrase. It's not necessarily the actual words I'm saying, but sometimes the vowel sounds contribute to the hookiness of the melody. So I tend to try and stick to the shapes of those words. But sometimes, the line I'm singing in the rough doesn't feel interesting lyrically. That's something I've been struggling with in that demo, actually, because I don't like those words but they're stuck in my head. What's been the biggest technical challenge? Recording my own vocals. I haven't done that since I was 15 and making demos in my parents' house. I'm so slow and it drives me crazy. I literally want to throw something at myself. What's the problem? I don't know my way around the software yet. And I'm not skilled enough to comp my vocals - which is where you sing the song five times and choose the best bits from each take. So now, instead, I'm just singing the whole thing right through. I probably sing each part 30 times and by the 30th one, I'm like, ""OK, this one is perfect. All the breaths are in the right place, all the nuances are right, this is the one"". But it's a very long process. Is it possible the end result is better? I guess you could say there's a solid flow of emotion in the full takes, I suppose. But I do feel like my takes are really good when I can tell someone else how to comp them. You've set yourself a deadline of 15 May. How important is that? I wanted to do the album in an intense period of time, because I thought it would be more fun for people watching, and also because there's more likely to be some kind of screw-up or error in a short amount of time, which is probably more interesting. I love that you're thinking of the social media narrative as well as the music. Yeah, I mean, some good stuff's got to happen. I don't want it to be seamless! You typically work very fast, so how far into the project have you got? Claws and Forever are finished, and then there are three other demos which are definitely going to go on the album. After that, there's one other song that's a maybe. But I don't just want to record 10 songs and put them on the album. I want to record multiple songs and decide which are the main 10. Will this change the way you work in the future? Definitely. Part of me is like, ""I don't know why I haven't made an album like this before"". I'm enjoying not travelling and being still and focusing on my music. That's something I never did before. It was always one million things going on at once, and taking a day here and there to record. So I think that will change because I love recording like this. You're lucky that technology means you can make music like this. It wouldn't have been possible 10 or 20 years ago. 100%. I would just be lost if I wasn't doing this. And there are a lot of other creative people who can't work during this time - so, for me, doing this project is also a way to support some of those people, whether that be video editors, or the painters who are doing my artwork, or 3D designers, or video directors. And I hope that not only will we be able to make some really great art together, but we'll be able to give back. My plan is to make three unique artworks for each song and I really want to be able to auction off the original artworks and donate the money to a charity. Aside from music, what else is keeping you going? I just started The Sopranos for the first time. I'm on episode nine. And I'm balancing Sopranos with Love Island, which I've never seen before. So I go back and forth between the two, and that is keeping me sane. I've also been painting rocks. I collect them in the garden and I paint them; and I've been enjoying cooking. I was definitely not much of a cook before quarantine. What's your specialty? I'm really into soups right now because I'm really trying not to be wasteful. I'm throwing everything I can into them... even that weird can at the back of the fridge that's been there for years. So if the music career fails, Masterchef beckons... Actually, my manager sent me a message saying, ""Oh my God, Bon Appétit [a mega-popular food blog] mentioned you!"" And I was like, ""What? That's huge!"" Then I read the article and it said, ""Watching Charli XCX try and cook is like watching a child learn a dance routine for the first time"".

"By Colin PatersonEntertainment correspondent The death this week of the Australian singer Helen Reddy prompted much discussion of her 1972 feminist anthem I Am Woman. Dame Jenni Murray even chose it as her exit music on her final edition of Woman's Hour on Thursday. The opening couplet goes: ""I am woman, hear me roar / In numbers too big to ignore."" The irony is that UK record-buyers did ignore the song, which sold so poorly it never made it into the chart. A US number one, it totally flopped in the UK, both on its original release and again in 1975, when it was re-released in an attempt to capitalise on Reddy's top five success with Angie Baby. It's not the only well-known anthem not to have made the UK top 100. Many famous songs weren't released as singles, especially in the 1970s, when the likes of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin wanted fans to concentrate on their albums. But here are 11 songs which did receive a single release, but missed the charts. 1) Ring of Fire - Johnny Cash (1963) Rolling Stone named it one of the 500 Greatest Songs ever. It was used in a Levi's advert at a time when that all but guaranteed a re-release hit. Cricketer Andrew Flintoff even picked it on Desert Island Discs. However, Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire has never made the UK charts. It would take a more psychedelic version by The Animals for the song to eventually make the top 40 in 1969. The Johnny Cash single might have had another chance at chart glory in 2004, but an attempt to license the track for use in an advert for a haemorrhoid relief cream was blocked by the Cash family. 2) Fun, Fun, Fun - The Beach Boys (1964) Fun, Fun, Fun was a flop, flop, flop when released in March 1964. This homage to ""cruising through the hamburger stand"" was the song The Beach Boys played most during their 2018 world tour, including at all of their UK shows - even though a Beatles and Rolling Stones-obsessed Britain showed the track zero love when it came out. They did eventually go into the top 30 with the track in 1996, but only with a re-recorded version featuring Status Quo. Mike Love, who sang the original vocal, returned at the age of 55. The mind boggled at the current age of the Daddy who ""took the T-bird away"". 3) I've Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You) - Aretha Franklin (1967) After making her name as a gospel singer, Aretha signed to Columbia Records in 1960. But, unsure of how to present her, the label had her record a mixture of jazz, blues, gospel, pop and soul, and for five frustrating years she failed to find commercial success. When her contract expired in 1966, she signed to Atlantic Records, travelled to Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and recorded I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You). Following nine flops on Columbia, a lot rested on the release as the first single from the album of the same name. In the US it sold a million copies, giving her the first top 10 hit of her career and becoming one of her signature tunes. In the UK it was released in April 1967 and did nothing. A month later her cover of Otis Redding's Respect was rush-released, reaching number 10 in the UK, triggering decades of British success for the Queen of Soul. 4) Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud - James Brown (1968) From the Queen of Soul to the Godfather of it... Released at the end of the tumultuous summer of 1968, James Brown's civil rights anthem provided a soundtrack to black Americans trying to break through interracial barriers. It peaked at number 10 in the US. Over in the UK, it completely failed to make a mark on the charts - as did so many of Brown's singles. Between 1966 and 76, arguably his peak years, Brown only made the UK top 40 once, with Get Up I Feel Like A Sex Machine scraping in at 32. It would take the heavyweight support of an appearance in Rocky IV before he ever went top 10, with Living In America. 5) Moondance - Van Morrison (1970) For decades, the most famous Van Morrison song never to have made the charts was Brown Eyed Girl. A 1967 top 10 hit in the US, where it has been played more than 10 million times on the radio, it never went ""skipping and a-jumping"" into the UK top 75 - until 2013, when it snuck in at number 60 on the back of download sales. This now leaves Moondance as the most fantabulously well-known Van Morrison single not to have been a hit. Admittedly, the decision to delay its release until seven years after the album of the same name did not help its cause. 6) Do The Strand - Roxy Music (1973) One of Roxy Music's biggest anthems - but not one that ever made the charts. Do The Stand was the track Bryan Ferry's band played on TV to publicise their second album, For Your Pleasure. But, as was common practice at the time, album tracks weren't released as singles. Around the same time, Roxy Music issued out the non-album cut Pyjamarama, which did reach the top 10. Do The Strand was eventually released as a single to promote their 1977 Greatest Hits, although it missed the charts, making it everything but one of their greatest hits. 7) Cat's In The Cradle - Harry Chapin (1974) This nostalgic ballad, about a father's regret, was a US number one in 1974 and once reduced Homer to tears on The Simpsons - when it was used as holding music on the ""Neglectful Father Helpline"". It was also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2011, but one honour the original never had was being a hit in the UK. Instead, a pretty straight cover version by the rock band Ugly Kid Joe made the UK top 10 in 1993. Chapin was not around to enjoy the success, though. He had died in a car crash in 1981. 8) Burning Down The House - Talking Heads (1983) Talking Heads' biggest US hit (where it was their only top 10 single) was a total miss in the UK. In Britain, it eventually made the charts in 1999, but only in a radically different form - with Tom Jones teaming up with The Cardigans to land his first top 10 single in a decade. Two years earlier, Sir Tom had released a single which could also be a contender for this list: his version of You Can Leave Your Hat On, for the Full Monty soundtrack. It's now a mainstay of his live show, but back then completely missed the top 75. 9) Skinny Love - Bon Iver (2008) One of the defining indie songs of the last 20 years, the brittle folk brilliance of Skinny Love was the single which took Justin Vernon to a mainstream audience. It would start him on a path which would see him collaborating with Kanye West (he was the rapper's only on-stage guest when he headlined Glastonbury), James Blake and Taylor Swift, whose current album Folklore would not exist without this song. The version of the song the British public put into the top 20 in 2011 was not the one by Bon Iver, but rather a cover by a 14-year-old from Hampshire called Birdy. 10) Alright - Kendrick Lamar (2015) Pitchfork named it the best song of the 2010s, it has 247 million plays on Spotify, and Kendrick Lamar has had 28 UK hits. Alright, however, is not one of them. In 2016 the track won two Grammys (best rap song and best rap performance) and has been described as the unifying song of the Black Lives Matter movement. The BET channel even suggested the song should become a modern black national anthem. The British public rewarded it with a chart position of 109. 11) Lottery (Renegade) - K Camp (2019) Atlanta-based rapper K Camp released Lottery (Renegade) in 2019, but it invaded living rooms and bedrooms around the UK earlier this year after sparking a huge dance craze on TikTok. Everyone from Lizzo to Millie Bobbie Brown has filmed themselves attempting the Renegade challenge, created by 14-year-old choreographer Jalaiah Harmon and made popular on the social media platform by Charli D'Amelio. It became the first song to be used in 20 million different TikTok clips. However, unlike Savage Love by Jason Derulo and Jawsh 685 or Doja Cat's Say So, it has failed to cross over into the charts. Michelle Obama is a fan of the track - but not even the former First Lady could land K Camp his first UK hit. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"Plans to privatise the TV company have been shelved, but where it spends its money is also under review, Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has announced. She said the government wants ""the benefits of this national asset to be spread far and wide, not just in London"". Channel 4 said a ""substantial relocation would be highly damaging"". The government carried out an 18-month review of the publicly-owned channel, which has more than 800 staff but fewer than 30 based outside central London. Ms Bradley will outline the consultation plans at the Nations and Regions Media Conference in Salford on Wednesday. Channel 4 is ""precious public asset"", she will say, but it must ""provide a platform for unheard voices and untold stories from right across the United Kingdom"". The consultation will look at whether the company should relocate all or some of its staff outside London, including the possibility of moving its headquarters. It will also review whether the amount of money spent on productions outside the M25, which is set at 35% of original British commissions, should increase to 50%. ""I am unsympathetic towards those who recoil in horror at the very idea of media jobs being based outside the capital,"" Ms Bradley will say. ""Or for those who insist that people with ideas in the West Midlands, west country or west Wales must travel to Westminster to get their programmes made."" Too much talent outside London was being overlooked, she will add. TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp, who fronts the Channel 4 programme Location, Location, Location, said moving the broadcaster would be ""idiotic"". Shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said ruling out privatisation was the ""right decision"" but it had taken the government ""far too long"" to reach the decision. ""Moving some or all of Channel 4 outside London is an idea worth considering, but the most important thing is not where it is based but where it makes its programmes, creates jobs and spends money,"" he added. Channel 4 welcomed the decision not to privatise the company but said a substantial relocation would hit investment in the creative industries. A spokesman added: ""The most important factor in supporting the nations and regions is where we spend our money rather than where Channel 4 is headquartered.""

"Her performance, those of her co-stars, and the production values of The Woman Who Fell To Earth came in for particular praise. But some critics felt there was still room for improvement. In his four-star review for The Sun, Rod McPhee said Whittaker ""may be the breath of fresh air needed to revive a flagging franchise"". ""She doesn't always strike the right balance between quirky geek and masterful Time Lord. And at times she comes across as irritatingly childlike. ""But the highest praise is that you quickly forget you're watching a female Doctor and just accept you're watching THE Doctor."" Writing in the i paper, Stephen Kelly complimented the show's improved production values. ""Never before has Doctor Who looked so crisp and cinematic, nor the CGI so convincing and expensive,"" he wrote. ""As any fan that has ever tried to convert a sceptic knows, Doctor Who's relatively low budget can often prove a barrier. ""But not any more. This feels like the real deal."" However, some critics struck a more dissenting note. ""As an episode of Doctor Who, The Woman Who Fell to Earth isn't perfect,"" said Huw Fullerton in The Radio Times. ""A few of the jokes (mainly focused on Whittaker getting used to her new incarnation) and lines of dialogue fall a bit flat. ""And on the whole it's definitely a less witty and quotable version of Who than we might have seen during the years of former showrunner Steven Moffat."" ""Does this first episode get everything right, all of the time? No,"" said Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffrey. ""But it scores where it really counts, showing more than enough wit and flair to convince us that we're entering into a new era that'll be every bit as bold and, yes, brilliant as we'd hoped."" The Telegraph's Ben Lawrence said: ""Chibnall has cooled things down with some much-needed accessibility, but still something is missing. ""There is also a distinct lack of interest in the show's heritage. ""Although Whittaker's performance captured the essence of previous incarnations of her character, the overall effect of the show sometimes felt like a trip too far from the familiar."" Carol Midgley awarded the episode four stars in her review from The Times. ""The best compliment I can pay Whittaker after the first episode, her casting doesn't feel remotely radical. It feels normal,"" she said. ""After 10 minutes, you forget her sex was ever an issue. Whittaker brings energy, fizz and modernity to the role while looking baby-faced compared to her predecessor, Peter Capaldi, whom she describes in the show as a white-haired Scotsman."" Martin Belam in The Guardian said: ""The sheer number of new characters, alongside guest star Sharon D Clarke, necessarily means that the alien menace is more of a low-key device to bring the characters together and introduce them to us, than a world-ending threat. ""That's not to say that the creatures' appearance won't give children nightmares."" Empire's Boyd Hilton added The Woman Who Fell To Earth ""looks beautiful in the show's new widescreen format"". ""Indeed, everything Jodie Whittaker and new showrunner Chris Chibnall have been promising us about the ramped-up, cinematic style of the new season turns out to be true. ""Those new lenses really do make a difference in giving the show a more textured, epic feel, matched by new composer Segun Akinola's atmospheric score.""

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter TV channels for towns and cities around the UK would ""transform lots of communities"", broadcast leadership debates for councils and police commissioners, and provide ""probably the biggest shake-up in our broadcasting landscape for two decades"". That was the idea behind local TV - Jeremy Hunt's big idea as culture secretary 10 years ago. Since then, 34 stations have launched from Manchester to Maidstone, Bristol to Belfast, each given a prime slot on the Freeview TV guide. However, many soon struggled financially and have been hit further by the pandemic, meaning local programming has been pared back. Now, many viewers probably don't realise they are watching a local channel at all. The biggest operator has removed the locations from its channel names - so That's Manchester, That's Swansea Bay, That's Hampshire and the company's other 17 stations are all now simply known as That's TV, while the company bills itself on its website as ""the home of classic TV"". That's TV's only local programming is now a 10-minute news bulletin every weekday, with the rest of the schedule being a diet of nostalgic music videos and teleshopping. That's TV chief executive Daniel Cass says he cut local programming to the single 6pm bulletin for each channel because of Covid. ""We're working really hard to deliver the best possible news service we can during the pandemic,"" he says. His channels are ""maintaining the absolute minimum staffing to get a news programme out within very limited office space"", he explains. But it was proving impossible to keep their previous schedule, which relied heavily on repeats, up-to-date when news about the pandemic changed so fast. Regulator Ofcom has relaxed broadcasters' commitments during the pandemic. The BBC also cut back on some regional programming for a spell and is separately making permanent cuts to its regional programming. And London's local TV service, London Live, has cut its news entirely during the pandemic, and was censured by Ofcom for a ""potentially harmful"" interview with conspiracy theorist David Icke. Once the pandemic is over, however, Mr Cass says his channels will go back to broadcasting the number of local hours that are required by Ofcom. But the challenges and concerns about the local-ness of local stations existed before Covid. That's TV snapped up most of its 20 Ofcom local licences after the original broadcasters found it wasn't commercially viable to run a small, truly local operation. In 2019, That's TV and other channels asked Ofcom for permission to cut their local programming, and That's TV lost some of its studios. 'Forgotten' towns and cities By February 2020, That's Manchester was airing half an hour of local news a day - which was repeated, with occasional small adjustments, over several hours. Syndicated generic documentaries and teleshopping filled the rest of the schedule. While some might have hoped for more fulsome local news, discussion and lifestyle programming, Mr Hunt actually originally said channels could broadcast local shows for as little as an hour a day, with the rest coming from a syndicated national schedule. Also at the outset, Ofcom said the content of the single hour didn't all even have to be new. The regulator said a 15-minute bulletin repeated four times could count as each day's hour of original local programming, as long as it was updated if necessary. So local TV channels could make as little as a quarter of an hour of local TV a day. Even the current 10-minute bulletin - including adverts - is more dedicated local TV news than viewers in areas like Scarborough or Salisbury get from the BBC or ITV, Mr Cass adds. ""We are delivering a voice for 'forgotten' towns and cities that is entirely consistent with the government and Ofcom's vision for local TV,"" he says. Elsewhere, channels in another eight areas including Liverpool, Leeds and Bristol are run by Local Television Ltd, which is chaired by former Daily Mirror chief executive David Montgomery. They each make a half-hour bulletin mixing local and national stories, which is repeated for six hours every weekday over breakfast, lunchtime and early evening. ""The local stories lead and the national stories support, and there are more local stories than national,"" says chief executive Lesley Mackenzie. She says features during the pandemic have included State of the Streets, showing viewers how busy their town centres and parks are; vox pops to gather local views; and exercise videos for the elderly in the north-east. Rather than sitting in studios, Local TV Ltd's presenters film their reports on the streets on iPhones, edit them on iPads, and will upload them to websites and social media as well as putting them on air. ""The old-fashioned model was not sustainable but we're moving to a much more lean, mean and efficient [model],"" Ms Mackenzie says. 'On a shoestring' Meanwhile, most of the rest of the day's schedules are filled by Judge Judy repeats and generic documentaries. ""Our ambition is constrained through funding, and I do believe we do offer a voice for local communities,"" she adds. The company is so confident in the appeal of local TV that it even launched a new channel in Manchester on Freeview channel 99 last week to rival That's TV, which fills the city's official local slot on channel seven. In Sheffield, Belfast, Nottingham, Brighton and Maidstone, independent local channels have managed to keep going, often working with volunteers or students to make more local programming then their larger counterparts. Maidstone's KMTV has a partnership with the University of Kent, and screens programmes covering local news, sport, business and politics, as well as one-offs like an overnight 2019 general election results show. ""We did that on an absolute shoestring,"" says KMTV's David Powell, who also chairs the Local TV Network, the sector's trade association. ""It was hard work, but we did it. We covered all of our local MPs' counts and got interviews with them so our loyal audience - which by 5am probably wasn't that great - got local perspectives and they gained something from that. ""Our local MPs and local councillors who appear [on KMTV] value it immensely. It's a chance to get their voice out and we can interrogate them and ask them difficult questions."" But the channel can only survive thanks to journalism students and a contract with the university to carry out other filming and run virtual open days. ""We would love to do more local content but we've got no money for it,"" Mr Powell says. ""We've got a lot of people saying, we want local democracy, we want local broadcasting. But actually there is never the resource to go with it."" The government asked the BBC to subsidise the local network at first, but the last of the corporation's £37.7m funding was paid last summer. And many who were sceptical about the success of local TV a decade ago have not changed their minds. 'A silly idea' Ed Vaizey, who was a culture minister when Mr Hunt came up with the idea, thinks the government has ""completely forgotten about it"". Lord Vaizey now sits on the House of Lords communications committee, and admits he has too. ""I thought local TV was a silly idea from the get-go,"" he says. ""We don't have the right ecosystem in the UK to support local television and it never really took off in any shape or form. ""Local TV might have made some difference in that it might have given media opportunities to young people who might not have otherwise got those experiences, and might have occasionally produced new content. But I've long ago lost touch with local TV."" The channels are ""taking up an important space"" on the Freeview guide, he adds. ""I think the government should grab this by the scruff of the neck and make a decision, either to rejuvenate it or to let it go, and I suspect the answer is to let it go and look at much better opportunities to support local journalism."" Steven Barnett, professor of communications at the University of Westminster, agrees that local TV hasn't lived up to expectations. ""It was a nonsense plan from the beginning, frankly,"" he says. Hits and misses ""One by one all the stations have gone to Ofcom cap in hand and said, 'Please will you relax the various requirements [for] local content and local journalism?' ""The other thing that happened is consolidation. It's become one organisation running the show centrally with tiny local opt-outs now and then. ""The idea of a genuine commitment to serving the local community, providing information or getting local entertainment was great, but he [Mr Hunt] just never trusted ordinary local people with the money and the organisational ability to do it."" Kerry Traynor from the University of Liverpool's Department of Communication and Media says she was ""one of the optimists"", but that the economics of local TV were ""always going to be a challenge"". ""I would have liked to have seen it survive with more public subsidy,"" she says, citing government support that has allowed greater grassroots local involvement in countries like Germany, Spain and Canada. ""There are some with strong local roots that are still going, still pushing through, like Brighton, Sheffield and Belfast,"" she says. ""There have been many others that have just been bought up and applications have been made to Ofcom to reduce the local programming and local content. There have been some hits and some... not-so-hits."" A decade ago, the promise to ""transform lots of communities"" may have raised expectations to an unrealistic level - but local TV operators insist they are following the core of Jeremy Hunt's original idea. ""We're trying to run it as a commercially viable business consistent with the vision for local TV that Jeremy Hunt set out, which is some local news within a network channel,"" Mr Cass says. ""His vision was very clear and precise and we're following it to the letter.""","A decade ago, a plan for new local TV channels to provide ""a new voice for local communities"" was set out by the government. Since they launched, the local identities and ambitions of many have eroded, but their operators insist they have fulfilled the original aim."
"By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter ""Do you think you'll get the real Lorraine Kelly, or Lorraine Kelly the actress?"" several friends and colleagues joke, referring to the judge who ruled as part of a tax case earlier this year that the ITV presenter had an on-air persona. Kelly may have been one of the most familiar faces on British television for more than three decades, her warm nature consistently endearing her to viewers, but in March she successfully argued she should be classed as an entertainment personality rather than a direct employee of ITV. The judge agreed, referring to the element of ""performance"" involved in making her TV show. Much hilarity followed on social media as people suggested the most cheerful broadcaster in the UK had been duping viewers for decades. ""I know people had a good old laugh about that, and that's fine!"" Kelly tells BBC News. ""But we all do that to a certain degree in our work. I mean, there are days that I go into work and I don't feel 100% but I'm not going to sit there and go 'poor me, poor me.' ""I've got the best job in the world, but, like every single human being on earth, you don't feel great all the time. But, you go in, and it doesn't matter what job you do, driving a bus or whatever it is, we've all got that kind of persona. You go home to your loved one and you go, 'Oh God I've had a terrible day!' But you don't do that while you're in your work, you're professional and you have to be."" On the day we meet, Kelly makes time for several fans waiting outside the BBC. She records birthday videos, takes selfies and signs autographs. You'd be hard-pushed to argue she was a miserable diva off camera. The release of her new book, Shine, comes at the end of a significant year for Kelly. To coincide with her 35th year in broadcasting and her forthcoming 60th birthday, she was awarded lifetime achievement honours at the Tric Awards in March and the TV Choice Awards in September. Born in the Gorbals area of Glasgow in 1959, Kelly never let a working class background stop her from pursuing a career in television. Despite an ongoing feeling of imposter syndrome (""I don't think that ever really leaves you,"" she says) and being told by a senior media figure early on that her accent would prevent her from succeeding as a presenter, Kelly made it to the top of the TV industry, seemingly against the odds. But things could have gone a very different way. 'Dramatic changes' Kelly recalls in the book the time she was replaced on GMTV while she was on maternity leave, leaving her unemployed. But a few months later, a baby food manufacturer, which was sponsoring a new mother-and-baby segment on ITV, specifically requested Kelly host it. It was phenomenally popular, and it eventually led to Kelly being given her own daily programme. She has remained on air since, presenting the slot straight after the main ITV breakfast show. She refers to the ""many regime changes"" she has lived through as her programme morphed from Top of the Morning to GMTV With Lorraine, to now, simply, Lorraine. Speaking about the significant evolution in the breakfast TV landscape, she says: ""It has changed dramatically, it really has. It's no longer seen as this little cosy slot, but then I don't think it ever was to be honest because when I think about it, we tackled every single issue under the sun. More so than they would in prime time."" She highlights the way her programme championed LGBT rights in a ""pioneering way"", and how it covered the Aids epidemic in the 1990s. The show has never shied away from serious health issues, and often showed demonstrations of how to spot signs of conditions such as breast cancer, encouraging viewers to check themselves. ""So I think the issues that we tackle are the same, but maybe the way that they're doing it is slightly different, particularly with Piers [Morgan],"" she says, referring to the co-host of Good Morning Britain, whose combative style is very different indeed to the cuddly proposition that GMTV used to be. ""Now, I know he's a very divisive figure, but he makes me howl with laughter sometimes,"" Kelly says. ""Sometimes I shout at him. Sometimes I completely disagree with him - on many, many things, we are polar opposites. ""But I always think people should be allowed to express their opinion. People should also be allowed to shoot them down when that opinion is ridiculous. But he is actually quite a kind person, and he's certainly taken breakfast TV by the scruff of the neck and given it a shake, and that's no bad thing."" The other key difference Kelly highlights is technology. ""When I first started, there was no internet,"" she points out. ""Nowadays, what we do is, if I've done an interview and it's 15 minutes long but we can only show five minutes on telly, then we put the big long version on YouTube."" This is a strategy which has paid dividends for several US chat shows, with clips from popular personalities like Ellen DeGeneres and Jimmy Kimmel regularly going viral. Shine could loosely be categorised as a self-help book, but it's also partially a memoir, with Kelly peppering anecdotes from her own life through her advice. She tackles issues such as good mental health and the realities of ageing, and her practical advice covers things like diet, exercise, screen time and how to keep a positive mindset. ""It's things to make you feel better inside and outside,"" she explains. ""And inside being, I think, more important. I'm so glad we're speaking about mental health now. If you've got a broken arm everybody goes, 'Aww, what a wee shame', but if your mind is not right for whatever reason, people never used to be as sympathetic, but they are now, and that's really good."" Kelly is honest about the difficulties she's faced in her own life, including a miscarriage and going through the menopause. She feels strongly that being open and talking about such issues is crucial. ""I do think it's really important, and it's only recently we've changed our mindset,"" she says. ""Before it was always 'soldier on, stiff upper lip', and that might work for some people, but all that does is you start getting overwhelmed. ""Five or six years ago, I suddenly felt really overwhelmed and anxious, and I'm not an anxious person. I'm somebody that just gets on with it, and I've usually got a sunny disposition, and I don't know where that went. All the life drained out of me, and I felt very flat. ""I wasn't sleeping, and I felt tired, but I spoke to Dr Hilary [Jones, her show's resident doctor], and he said 'it's the menopause'. And I went on HRT [hormone replacement therapy], which I know doesn't work for everyone, but for me was an absolute game changer. So I thought, if it's happened to me, it's happened to lots of people. ""And I wanted to do something on the show, but women in the public eye didn't want to talk about it. So I did, and then Carol Vorderman and Ulrika Jonsson came on and talked about it, and women like that speaking about it and being so honest really made a huge difference. With daytime telly, we can be pioneers, we can talk about things."" The book's publication precedes her 60th birthday on 30 November (""St Andrews Day - couldn't be more Scottish!"" she laughs). After that, how much longer would she like to continue presenting? ""I'll do it for as long as people want to watch. And as long as I'm enjoying it, which obviously I am. Every day is different, you never know what's going to happen."" Shine by Lorraine Kelly is out now.",The gags begin several days before our interview with one of the UK's best-loved broadcasters actually takes place.
"Anne, who wrote Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, died in Scarborough in 1849 after succumbing to tuberculosis at the age of 29. But her headstone in St Mary's Churchyard gave her age as 28. A new plaque on her grave has been officially unveiled during a service of dedication. Anne is the only member of the famous literary family who is not buried at their home in Haworth, West Yorkshire. She travelled to Scarborough because she loved the resort and hoped that the air may improve her condition. But she died just three days after arriving. Her death came during a bleak period for the Bronte family. Brother Branwell had died eight months earlier, followed by Emily, who had written Wuthering Heights. Anne's original gravestone was refaced three years after her death, when Charlotte returned to discover five errors on it. The other mistakes were corrected but the age was not. The Bronte Society has installed the new plaque alongside the original, which has deteriorated over the years. ""Anne was the quietest Bronte and can still sometimes be overlooked in favour of her sisters Charlotte and Emily,"" said the society's Sally McDonald. ""In some ways, though, she is now viewed as the most radical of the sisters, writing about tough subjects such as women's need to maintain independence, and how alcoholism can tear a family apart. ""It is a pleasure to honour her in this modest way... in the coastal town she loved so much."" Often left alone together in their isolated Haworth home, Charlotte, Emily and Anne began to write stories at an early age Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights are now hailed as British classics, while The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was a huge bestseller. Charlotte continued to write after her siblings' deaths and later married, only to die herself in March 1855.","Author Anne Bronte, the sister of Charlotte and Emily, has been given a new gravestone after 164 years to correct an error on the original."
"The singer told The Ellen Show she had received ""rude, mean-spirited"" comments after she posted a semi-nude image of her toddler son. ""Someone went as far as saying someone should call child services… some of the nastiest things. And I cried so hard after that,"" she said. ""I won't share them anymore."" The star said she understands people's concerns but added people could be kinder with their responses. The image in question was one of Pink with her son and daughter and a pelican that had wandered into their home. ""It spent two hours with us which was incredible... two-year-olds don't like to wear wet swim diapers and apparently at some point he took it off. I don't think like that. We live on a farm. My kids are naked, it's what happens, I'm naked sometimes."" She also received criticism after posting a video of her son playing with cars during which he can be heard saying, ""Ah, damn it."" ""Some people were like: 'Nice language, I'm sure that came from you' and 'What kind of mother do you think you are?' ""And I understand people saying you need to be more careful because you are in the public eye and you should have thought of that - they're right. But there's a nice way to say that. There's a kind way to be online."" Over-sharing? She added: ""Somebody else taught me two weeks ago that the word 'gypsy' is derogatory and I'm not a person who uses derogatory language. I wrote back to them: 'Thank you so much for being so kind and for educating me. I'm editing, I'm taking it down and that word will never come out of my mouth again.'"" She said the time was right to stop posting images of her daughter anyway. ""It's also probably a good time, she's seven now. It's probably time to pull her back from the world and let her live her best life.""

The Hollywood film producer has ""unequivocally denied"" any allegations of non-consensual sex. No arrests have been made over any of the allegations at this stage, the Metropolitan Police said. Police are investigating the allegations under Operation Kaguyak. Police have not given any more details about the complainants or alleged offences at this stage. New York police are also investigating claims against the 65-year-old, including rape and sexual assault. Numerous allegations have been made against the movie mogul by women including actresses Angelina Jolie, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow. Earlier this month, UK police confirmed they were investigating claims from three women that they were attacked in Westminster, Camden and west London, before confirming the four new allegations. On Tuesday, the Producers Guild of America said Weinstein had been banned for life over reports of his ""decades of reprehensible conduct"". Actress Rose McGowan says she was offered $1m (£760,000) from Harvey Weinstein in exchange for her silence. McGowan says she turned down the money the day before the New York Times ran an expose on the movie mogul earlier this month.

"The temporary closure of Tate St Ives is to allow work on an extension, which will create new galleries sunk into the coastal hillside. Tate St Ives will reopen on 17 May for its 21st Birthday celebrations and the launch of its Summer 2014 exhibition, International Exchanges: Modern Art. A temporary visitor centre will be open daily so the public can view the plans. The extension will allow Tate St Ives to present more works from the entire Tate collection, although building work will continue until 2016. The new galleries will create the capacity for three separate exhibition zones. The roof will also form a new public terraced space. International Exchanges: Modern Art and St Ives will run until 28 September, exploring the wider national and international contexts which shaped art in St Ives in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. It is part of a series of exhibitions exploring the histories and legacies of art in St Ives, an artists colony, and will also mark the gallery's 21st anniversary. Major works by key British modernists such as Peter Lanyon and Patrick Heron will be seen alongside those of their contemporaries from elsewhere in Europe, North America and beyond. The adjacent Barbara Hepworth Museum and Sculpture Garden will remain open daily throughout the Tate's closure, hosting events including talks, tours and workshops.",The Cornish branch of the Tate will close for almost four months from 27 January to make way for building work.
"The last episode of the ITV show, which stars David Tennant and Olivia Colman, will air on Monday evening. Chris Chibnall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's a strange feeling actually, it's quite emotional. ""It's been an extraordinary journey with the show and [its success] has taken us all by surprise."" Did the critics like Broadchurch? Confirming the drama will not return for any future series, he said: ""That is it and there will be no more after this one, absolutely."" The storyline of the final series has centred around the rape of Trish Winterman - played by former Coronation Street actress Julie Hesmondhalgh. Chibnall explained: ""When I thought about telling this story, the first thing I did, along with the people I work with, was go and talk to various people and charities who worked supporting survivors of sexual assault. ""We went to Dorset sexual assault referral centre and Rape Crisis and Survivors' Trust, and the question I asked them was 'Should we be telling this story in Broadchurch, is it an appropriate thing to do?' ""They were unanimous in their reply and said: 'Yes, absolutely, you should, you must, because there's an incredible amount of support out there for people who survive these crimes.'"" He added he was also keen for Colman and Tennant's characters - DS Ellie Miller and DI Alec Hardy - to show exemplary behaviour when dealing with the case. ""I noticed Dorset Police put out a statement the other day in response to the programme saying 'If you report [a rape] you will be believed by police', so we wanted to show best practice by these extraordinary people that we'd met,"" Chibnall said. Plans for Doctor Who Chibnall's next job will be taking over the reins at Doctor Who, after Steven Moffat announced he would be leaving the programme. The last series of the show to star Peter Capaldi as the Doctor began on BBC One on Saturday, with the opening episode attracting an average of 4.6 million viewers. But Chibnall was reluctant to give too much away about what he has planned for the show when he takes over. ""It's way too early to talk about Doctor Who. There's still an amazing series to go out with Peter Capaldi,"" he said. ""I've been thinking about it for a long time and we're putting a team together. But for another year there is an amazing Doctor, there's an amazing showrunner in Steven Moffatt and I've read the scripts for this series and they are phenomenal.""

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Ali Hirsz needs the trapezius muscle that runs from her neck to her shoulder rebuilt, in an operation that isn't available on the NHS. After Covid-19 robbed her of income from live music, she had to ask fans to help raise the money for the operation. Her initial crowd-funding goal was £1,000 - but once she reached £500, the Manics stepped in and paid the rest. When the donation arrived, ""I was in tears,"" she tells the BBC. ""I love them anyway, they're such a great band, but £500 is so unbelievably generous. I thought, 'I can't believe they've done that.' ""It's such a relief."" Representatives for the Manic Street Preachers confirmed to the BBC that the donation had come from the band. 'Very stressful' Hirsz, who sings with an indie band called Idealistics, has an incurable connective tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The condition means ""my skin is like tissue paper, it tears really easy,"" says the 20-year-old. A vascular compression on her small intestine also requires her to be fed via a tube. She needs corrective surgery on her shoulder after a previous operation severed the nerve to her trapezius muscle, causing it to waste away. As a result, her shoulder blade dropped, affecting the blood supply to her arm. The condition has already forced her to stop playing bass, as she has little feeling in her left hand. She says she has ""never asked for money before"" and was ""sweating with nerves"" before posting her crowd-funding request last week. But the campaign became necessary after coronavirus wiped out her band's concert diary; and Hirsz had to leave her day job as a horse trainer because she was shielding. In the the meantime, she says, she received no financial support from the government's furlough or self-employment support schemes. ""It is very, very stressful, particularly in times where you don't have money lying around anyway,"" she says. The response to her campaign has been ""overwhelming"", however. Hirsz hit the £1,000 goal within 24 hours, and has since increased her target to £5,000. ""Because the surgery's not been done before, we don't know exactly how much it's going to cost,"" she explains. ""I know it's a hard time for everyone,"" she adds, ""so all these donations mean everything."" Disabled musicians 'on a tightrope' Hirsz says her story is typical of disabled musicians, who have found themselves left high and dry by the Covid-19 pandemic. Singer-songwriter Chloe Mogg, who has both fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, agrees the last six months have been ""really, really tough"". ""The NHS is doing an amazing job at the moment but, especially with chronic fatigue syndrome, it seems like all the invisible illnesses have been pushed to the side,"" she says. ""We're walking on a tightrope and we don't know if we're going to fall off at any stage."" But Mogg, like Hirsz, has approached the pandemic with imagination and resilience, channelling her energies into organising an online music and arts festival. Called The 7 Arts Still Exist, it highlights the work created by artists, designers, sculptors, writers, musicians, dancers and photographers during the pandemic. Mogg is already lining up its third event with her childhood friend Amy Crouch. The musician says the pandemic has taught her to ""live more in the present moment"", even when ""it felt like I've been put on pause"". ""It's been tough for me and it's been tough for a lot of musician friends who have anxiety problems,"" she says. ""It's something we're learning to adapt to - but I don't feel like we should be needing to adapt. It's really, really tough."" For visually-impaired sitar player Baluji Shrivastav, adaptability has been the watchword for the last six months. The 70-year-old, who has played with Oasis, Stevie Wonder, Massive Attack, Kylie Minogue and Coldplay, cannot travel during the pandemic, making it ""very difficult to perform anywhere"". ""But we still meet sometimes,"" he says. ""We are allowed to meet six people in one place, and we have a garden so we rehearse there sometimes - but it will be difficult in the winter."" Shrivastav was appointed an OBE in 2016 for his services to music, after founding the Inner Vision Orchestra, whose players are all blind or partially-sighted. He says live-streamed concerts are harder for blind musicians, because communication between players is reliant on physical proximity. Meeting up for socially-distanced concerts poses other problems. ""Even if we can reach the venue without help, we need help within the venue itself,"" he says. ""It's a constant difficulty for visually-impaired people. ""And, of course, financially, we are not earning at all."" 'Risk of invisibility' According to the UK Disability Arts Alliance #WeShallNotBeRemoved, the pandemic has had a particularly negative impact on disabled people working in the creative industries. In an open letter to the secretary of state for culture, Oliver Dowden MP, the alliance warned that ""many disabled artists are facing long term shielding, a total loss of income, compromised independent living and the risk of invisibility in wider society"". Separately, the Audience Access Alliance - which represents 12 disability charities in the UK - says it is ""deeply concerned"" that disabled people will miss out on access to gigs, theatre and sport when venues reopen because of extra Covid-related precautions and restrictions. ""If we want to 'build back better', it's vital that we build back for all,"" the organisation wrote in an open letter to the live music industry earlier this month. The fear for both organisations is that the progress made since the UK's equality act came into force 10 years ago will be lost. Ridiculed Hirsz and Mogg both have horror stories about the discrimination they faced before Covid. One promoter refused to work with Idealistics because of Hirsz's condition. ""They said, 'You've got all these [feeding] tubes and nobody wants to see that. You're just going to deter a crowd,'"" she recalls. Mogg was also berated by a promoter last year, after a flare-up of fibromyalgia forced her to pull out of a show. ""He was like, 'You're a massive disappointment,'"" she says. ""It was so embarrassing. I felt really ridiculed and ashamed of my illness, even though it's part of me."" Despite the challenges like those, Hirsz, Mogg and Shrivastav are determined to stay active throughout the pandemic. The Idealistics have just released their new single Memory River (inspired, naturally, by the Manic Street Preachers), while Hirsz is working as an advocate for disability charity Attitude is Everything. On Monday, Shrivastav's Inner Vision Orchestra launched their first studio album, Indian Classical Interactions - one of three records the musician recorded in the space of a week before lockdown earlier this year. A documentary about his life will also be screened at the Bloomsbury festival this weekend. And Mogg is busy finalising the third edition of The 7 Arts Still Exist, which will feature country artists Katy Hurt and Roisin O'Hagan. In the meantime, she says its crucial that everyone looks out for the people around them, and asks for help when they need it. ""Just be kind, be bold and, especially if you're suffering, talk to someone and tell them how you're feeling. Because they would rather hear it now than listen to your story at a funeral.""

"Hollywood's biggest stars will gather on Sunday evening at the Dolby Theatre for the 90th Academy Awards. But a spotlight will be shone too on the issues that have transformed the film world, symbolised by the Time's Up movement. The Shape of Water leads the field with 13 nominations. Jimmy Kimmel is taking on hosting duties for the second year in a row, having coped admirably with the envelope mix-up that saw La La Land accidentally named best picture last year instead of Moonlight. He's expected to address politics during the show but there's bound to be room for a couple of jokes at the expense of his A-list friends like Matt Damon. The chat show host also hasn't ruled out a return to the stage for Warren Beatty, who was the best picture presenter - alongside Faye Dunaway - last year. Catch me up However, Kimmel has already told ABC he won't reference Me Too and Time's Up because he doesn't want the show to be about ""reliving people's sexual assaults"". But it may be that Time's Up dominates the conversation both on the red carpet and in the winners' speeches anyway, with Hollywood having seen a seismic shift. During the show there will be performances from each best song nominee, including Sufjan Stevens, Common and Mudbound's Mary J Blige - who, as well as singing on the soundtrack, is also up for best supporting actress. Guillermo del Toro is tipped to take the best director prize for the otherworldly romance, starring British actress Sally Hawkins as a mute janitor who falls in love with an amphibious man. Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is highly tipped to take home the night's top prize - best picture. Others nominees include Get Out, the horror film starring Skins' actor Daniel Kaluuya, and Christopher Nolan's war epic Dunkirk, featuring Harry Styles's debut acting role. Kaluuya is also nominated in the best actor category - against fellow Brit Gary Oldman, for his transformation into wartime prime minister Sir Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour. Lesley Manville is nominated for best supporting actress for Phantom Thread, with other British nominees including costume designer Jacqueline Durran and cinematographer Roger Deakins. Three Billboards' lead Frances McDormand, who stars as a grieving mother determined to avenge her teenage daughter's brutal death, is widely expected to be named best actress. She's already won that accolade at the Golden Globes and the Baftas. However, she faces competition from three-time winner Meryl Streep for The Post, as well as Saoirse Ronan for her role in Lady Bird as Christine, a teenager on the cusp of adulthood. The best supporting actress Oscar seems sewn up, thanks to Allison Janney's portrayal of skating champion Tonya Harding's cold-as-ice mother. The West Wing star told the BBC she found playing the part of the embittered, uncaring LaVona Golden to be ""liberating"". Laurie Metcalf has been praised too though, for her realistic portrayal of Lady Bird's mother. The film is Greta Gerwig's first as director and has seen her become only the fifth woman to be nominated for best director. Outside of the acting awards, there are British contenders in the best short film category, with Rachel Shenton nominated for The Silent Child. And British animation company Magic Light Pictures is up for best animated short for Revolting Rhymes. In the best animation race, Coco - DisneyPixar's film set in Mexico on Day of the Dead - is expected to take home the prize. The best foreign picture is seen as a two-horse race, between The Square and Loveless. After the ceremony, stars will flock to the Governor's Ball - with the lucky few clutching Oscars able to get them engraved there - or other parties including the star-studded one hosted by Vanity Fair.

"The actor had filmed one of the lead roles in All the Money in the World, which finished shooting earlier this year and is due out next month. Spacey has been replaced by Christopher Plummer, however, after allegations of sexual harassment emerged against him. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said: ""You can't tolerate any kind of behaviour like that."" The director said: ""You can't condone that kind of behaviour in any shape or form,"" adding that keeping Spacey in the picture would have spelled disaster for the film. ""We cannot let one person's action affect the good work of all these other people. It's that simple,"" he said. Spacey has been accused of sexual assault and harassment by a number of men and, according to his spokesperson, is ""taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment"". The decision to replace him was taken swiftly by the 79-year-old British film director. The first claims of misconduct against Spacey were made at the end of October. By 9 November, Scott announced he would reshoot all of the actor's scenes with Christopher Plummer - and still make the 22 December release date. Scott said he had been happy with Spacey's performance, describing him as a ""very talented man and I got on very well with him"". He added he had ""no idea"" about any claims of sexual misconduct. Spacey played oil tycoon Jean Paul Getty in All the Money in the World. The film tells the story of the kidnapping of Getty's grandson and the attempts by the boy's mother (played by Michelle Williams) and a former CIA operative (Mark Wahlberg) to raise the ransom. Williams and Wahlberg agreed to return to set, including on location in the UK, to reshoot scenes - despite it clashing with the US Thanksgiving holiday. Scott's comments come as the first trailer featuring Christopher Plummer in Spacey's role has been released. The director began re-shooting Spacey's scenes with Plummer on 20 November and said he had already finished filming. ""I've done it... We're not dealing with celluloid any more - it's all digital, and I send [the footage each day] to [editor Claire Simpson] and she cuts it, and I can go in and look after shooting,"" he said. ""Everything I've shot is already in [the final cut] up through yesterday morning."" Scott admitted the film studio had its doubts that he would manage it, saying: ""They were like, 'You'll never do it. God be with you.'"" Scott added: ""There's no time for pondering. Sometimes you've got to lay down the law. You have to!"" Michelle Williams told Entertainment Weekly she was stunned by news of the allegations against Spacey, but ""immediately started to feel better"" upon learning about the decision to replace him in the film. ""This doesn't do anything to ease the suffering of people who were all too personally affected by Kevin Spacey, but it is our little act of trying to right a wrong,"" she said. ""And it sends a message to predators - you can't get away with this any more. Something will be done."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Nasa is working with Cruise to film aboard the International Space Station. There are no details of the film, but Deadline - which first reported the story - said it would not be a new instalment of Mission: Impossible. The report also said Cruise, 57, is also working with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which will transport two US astronauts to the ISS for Nasa later this month. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine wrote on Twitter: ""Nasa is excited to work with Tom Cruise on a film aboard the Space Station!"" Musk replied to say the project ""should be a lot of fun!"" Cruise played an astronaut in 2013 film Oblivion, when he safeguarded Earth's natural resources from alien invaders. He also narrated the 2002 Imax documentary Space Station 3D. It's not known when the star will blast off to the ISS for real. Despite the pandemic, SpaceX's Crew Dragon is due to take Nasa astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the ISS on 27 May. The spacecraft can accommodate seven people. Risky business: 4 daredevil stunts from Cruise's career By Ian Youngs, entertainment reporter As well as being one of Hollywood's most popular action heroes, Cruise is known as a daredevil who does many of his own stunts. In an interview about his new Top Gun sequel, co-star Miles Teller says: ""I think when Tom hears that something's impossible or can't be done, that's when he gets to work."" That sounds not unlike his Mission: Impossible character Ethan Hunt, who has been seen in many of the most daring scenes. 1. Leaping off a roof (and breaking an ankle) In 2017, he broke his ankle while jumping from one rooftop to another (attached to a cable) for Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Despite instantly knowing he was injured, he carried on by hauling himself onto the roof and running off. ""I knew it was broken,"" he later told The Graham Norton Show. ""I just said, 'Ugh,' and I ran past the camera. We got the shot, it's in the movie."" His co-star Simon Pegg joked: ""Everyone said, when you got up and ran out of shot, 'Oh, that's so him. To complete the shot with your foot hanging off - that's so him.'"" 2. Climbing a skyscraper In 2011's Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol, Hunt is seen scaling the Burj Khalifa in Dubai - the world's tallest building - from the outside. Although Cruise trained for four months and was wearing a harness - which was edited out - he said he struggled with crosswinds as he tried to swing in through a window. ""It took a while to work out how not to come slamming into the building head first,"" he said. 3. Hanging off a plane during take-off In Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Cruise hangs from the side of a plane by his fingertips as it takes off. It was really him, and it was a real plane. He performed the stunt four times over two days, again wearing a harness, but the crew had to scour the runway for the tiniest items that could have been thrown up and hit him. ""While we are going down the runway, we're worried about bird strikes, any kind of particle that the propellers could pick up, any kind of stone,"" Cruise told USA Today. ""I remember I got hit by a stone that was so tiny, you cannot believe. I thought it broke my rib. Lucky it went to my vest and not my hands or my face, it would have penetrated and gone right through."" 4. Falling off a cliff One of his other famous stunts appears in the opening scene of Mission: Impossible 2, where Hunt climbs - and then almost falls off - a vertigo-inducing cliff, apparently with no ropes. Cucumber-cool Cruise was actually attached to a thin safety wire, which was later erased - but that did little to calm director John Woo's nerves. ""I was really mad that he wanted to do it, but I tried to stop him and I couldn't,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""I was so scared I was sweating. I couldn't even watch the monitor when we shot it."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"The Oscar-winning actor was out for a jog in Central Park, New York, on Saturday when he bumped into Elisabeth and Ryan who, resplendent in white gown and tuxedo, were having their wedding photos taken. Hanks posted his photo of the moment on Twitter, sharing it with more than 12 million followers and offering ""congrats and blessings"" to the couple.

""He asked their names and wished them congratulations, and before he left he asked to take a selfie with them. He posted it within minutes to his Instagram, Twitter and Facebook."" Ryan told the BBC, whilst honeymooning on the beach in Hawaii: ""A man tapped us on the shoulder and introduced himself as Tom Hanks. It was pretty surreal. I didn't register for a split second. I was shell shocked. ""He was so nice and kind. He could have just kept running but he posed for photos with us and my family. We invited him to the reception but he couldn't make it.

"""As a result of ongoing discussions, Netflix and the producers have written Danny Masterson out of The Ranch,"" the company said. ""Yesterday was his last day of work, and we'll make new episodes in 2018 without him."" Masterson has denied the ""outrageous allegations"" and vowed to clear his name ""once and for all"". In March, the Los Angeles Police Department said it was investigating the actor after three women said they were assaulted in the early 2000s. A fourth woman has since reportedly come forward to accuse him. On Tuesday, the LAPD said there was no update on the investigation. Masterson said in a statement: ""I am obviously very disappointed in Netflix's decision to write my character off of The Ranch. ""From day one, I have denied the outrageous allegations against me. Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. ""I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. In this country, you are presumed innocent until proven guilty. ""However, in the current climate, it seems as if you are presumed guilty the moment you are accused.

"Danny Rubin, who wrote the film script, and Matilda director Matthew Warchus, will also be on board. Minchin, who revealed the news on his blog, said: ""Our version of Groundhog Day is going to be both instantly recognisable, and utterly different."" The 1993 film, starring Bill Murray, is considered to be a comedy classic. It tells the story of a grumpy weatherman who is sent to a small town to do a weather report and gets stuck in a time loop, having to live the same day over and over again until he learns how to be a better person. Minchin wrote: ""The central conceit is perfectly suited to the theatre... it has the potential to be complex, dark, visually fascinating, and thematically rich, whilst still being a joyous romantic comedy with cool tunes and lots of gags. ""It's certainly not an easy job, and I'm truly honoured - and genuinely excited - that Danny is letting me have a crack at it."" US comedy He added that Stephen Sondheim had considered adapting Groundhog Day for the stage a few years ago but ""it got put on the back burner, and he is now happy that we're making a go of it. We have Steve's blessing - and it's a blessing I value enormously."" The comedian added that he hoped Groundhog Day would be on the stage in a couple of years but did not reveal where. He has already written two ballads for the musical which he showcased at a gig in London late last year but did not reveal what the songs were in relation to. Minchin's Matilda has been playing at the Cambridge Theatre in London's West End since October 2011, winning great critical acclaim and many accolades, including seven Laurence Olivier awards. Matilda opened in Broadway's Shubert Theatre in April 2013 - it won four Tony Awards last year, having received 12 nominations.

Annie Baker's play The Flick won the Pulitzer for drama while Vijay Seshadri won the poetry prize for 3 Sections. US historian Alan Taylor earned his second Pulitzer for The Internal Enemy: Slavery and War In Virginia. Tartt's 784-page bestseller The Goldfinch, which was named Amazon's 2013 book of the year, is set in modern Manhattan and tells the story of a young orphan coming to terms with the death of his mother. Columbia University, which awards the prize, said judges described it as ""a beautifully written coming-of-age novel … that stimulates the mind and touches the heart. The book, which is in the running for this year's Bailey's Women's Prize for Fiction in the UK, beat two other nominees, The Son by Philip Meyer and The Woman Who Lost Her Soul by Bob Shacochis. Fans of Tartt had waited a decade since her second novel The Little Friend, which many had found disappointing after her strong 1992 debut The Secret History. ""The only thing I am sorry about is that Willie Morris and Barry Hannah aren't here,"" said Tartt, referring to two authors who were her early mentors. ""They would have loved this,"" she added. Last month it was reported by The Wrap that a film version or TV series of The Goldfinch is in the works, by the producers behind The Hunger Games.

Judges called his piece ""a haunting orchestral work that suggests a relentless tidal surge, evoking thoughts of melting polar ice and rising sea levels"". The biography prize was awarded to Megan Marshall's Margaret Fuller: A New American Life, about the 19th-Century intellectual and transcendentalist. Colonial historian Taylor said writing The Internal Enemy had been an education for him. He found documents showing how escaped slaves had assisted the British during the War of 1812 and were an important factor in the British capture of Washington, DC. ""This is a story I had known nothing about and I was supposed to be a specialist,"" said Taylor.

Helen Marten, who works in collage and screen-printing, is also in the running for the prestigious £25,000 prize. BBC News broadcast a tour of the exhibition on Facebook Live on Monday with arts editor Will Gompertz. In a rare move, visitors will be able to take their own photos and video at the exhibition and share them via social media. The aim of the prize is to ""promote public debate around new developments in contemporary art"". Tate Britain in London is hosting the exhibition, which runs until January, with the winner to be named in December. The prize is awarded to a British artist under the age of 50 who is considered to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. The winner will be announced in London on 5 December. Next year's prize will be given out in Hull when it is UK City of Culture. Anthea Hamilton, who lives and works in London, is shortlisted for her Lichen! Libido! Chastity! exhibition at SculptureCenter, New York. The Tate said her sculpture, installation, performance and video bring ""a surrealist sensibility to popular culture"" and ""seduce the viewer with comic and unexpected combinations of images, materials and words"". Michael Dean, from Newcastle, is nominated for sculptures and installations made from ""aesthetically-overlooked materials"" like salvaged corrugated metal from a shop shutter. The Tate said his work, seen at South London Gallery and de Appel arts centre in Amsterdam, is ""concerned with the physical presentation of language"". Helen Marten creates sculpture, screen printing and writing featuring the ""collage-like accumulation"" of ""models and motifs taken from contemporary visual culture"". The Tate said she ""creates poetic, pictorial puzzles"" drawing on ""gestures and imagery of our everyday lives"". From Macclesfield, Cheshire, she is nominated for her presentations at the 56th Venice Biennale and Greene Naftali in New York. Josephine Pryde's work, meanwhile, focuses on the meeting point between art and photography. Tate said it examined the idea of ""art as commodity and of the seductive qualities of the wider art world"", adding that she ""calls into question the conventions of the gallery"". The artist, from Alnwick, Northumberland, is nominated for her solo exhibition Lapses in Thinking by the Person I am at CCA Wattis in San Francisco. One of her pieces in that exhibition was Lapses in Thinking, a model of a Union Pacific freight locomotive pulling two box carriages which visitors could sit on and ride around the gallery.

"By Georgie RogersBBC News entertainment reporter As well as the Oscar-winning 1939 film, starring Judy Garland, there has been The Wiz - the Motown-produced version starring Diana Ross and Michael Jackson - unofficial Disney sequel Return to Oz and even a Muppet version. On stage, the tale has also undergone many incarnations, including the recent Andrew Lloyd Webber West End production and the Tony award-winning musical Wicked - told from the perspective of the witches - which continues to be a hit both in London and on Broadway. For his new take on the tale, director Sam Raimi's plan from the outset was to make a film that serves as a prequel to Baum's book. His 3D version, Oz The Great And Powerful, tells the untold story of how a charming con-man, Oscar Diggs, became the wizard of Oz. ""Thank God we weren't trying to remake the sacred classic that everybody loves,"" says Zach Braff, who plays both Diggs' underappreciated circus assistant and provides the voice of a computer generated flying monkey. ""Audiences really like that world, so with all this amazing technology today... it made sense to tell an origin story of 'how did this guy end up behind the curtain?'"" he explains. The film stars 127 Hours actor James Franco as Diggs, a con-man who finds himself in Oz after being caught up in a Baum-esque freak tornado. He is greeted, in turn, by warring witch sisters Theodora, Evanora and Glinda, played by Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams respectively, who show him the good and the bad in the mystical land. Academy Award-winner Weisz says the chance to play a ""good old-fashioned villainess"" drew her to the role of Evanora. ""I thought it would be really fun to play someone really bad and evil... the more evil they are, the more fun they have."" she says. The actress remembers going to see the 1939 MGM film as one of her first trips to the cinema. ""What makes that film very charming, is the sweetness,"" she says. ""You can see the make-up and the special effects are at the beginning of what special effects can do."" ""The fact that now they can make me look like I'm flying, when I'm on wires, is impressive."" Despite the technological advancements, Franco says there were certain elements of the book and Judy Garland film that were imperative for this version of Oz to be believable. ""You need the yellow brick road, the Emerald City; you expect flying monkeys, munchkins, witches, wizards - you need all those things for it to be Oz,"" he says. ""But then you also need a fresh take on it, and one of the things that they can do - 70 years later - is create the land of Oz in a seamless and spectacular way. ""They don't need to rely on theatrical conventions anymore and they don't need grown men in lion pyjamas. They can make creatures that look like an actual flying monkey, and you believe it."" Raimi's new Disney offering cost approximately $200m (£133m). Money well spent, argues Braff. ""What Sam did with 3D, and what [production designer] Robert Stromberg did with the look of the thing, is really a whole other level of what you can do these days."" The sets, masterminded and built by Stromberg - who also worked on Disney's recent remake of Alice in Wonderland - were a key feature of Raimi's vision of Oz. The director himself was very involved in controlling the look and feel of the film, down to the smallest detail. ""You build everything - from the smallest blade of grass to the smallest blossom, to the insects and squirrels, to the trees,"" explains Raimi. ""Then there were cities and lands and forests,"" he continues. ""Glinda's kingdom had to look French Nouveau, very feminine to reflect her character; the Emerald City had to be the Manhattan of Oz - sophisticated, art deco, sharp angles and very strong contrasts."" As for making the film in 3D, Raimi says he and his team ""went to school"" to study the format and ""learned how it was best done from the ground up"". He used several techniques, including editing in longer takes and using a lot of light to give the feeling that ""the air of Oz would seem like it was crystal clear, so you could see forever"". ""These things, and more, were designed to pull the audience into the experience and give them perhaps the best 3D they've ever seen,"" the director says. ""If people are conscientious and they want to learn how to do it, it can be done very well now."" Reviews for the film in the US have been mixed. The Hollywood Reporter claims the ""unimaginative"" film is pitched at children under the age of six, but others reviewers praise the colourful ""feast for the eyes"" and immersive 3D experience. However, Raimi believes he achieved a film which ""fits right into the Disney mould of family entertainment"" - but one that does not claim to be in the same league as the 1939 film. ""The Wizard of Oz is such a spectacular picture and holds such a dear place in my heart that I would never want to claim that we captured any of that very special magic,"" he says. ""But this picture is a unique thing and I think that is has its own level of magic."" Oz The Great & Powerful is out on general release.",L Frank Baum's children classic The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has inspired countless adaptations since it was written in 1900.
"Speaking to Florida Today ahead of a one-man show, the 77-year-old said: ""I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn't have to answer to innuendos."" More than a dozen women have now have come forward to accuse Cosby of sexually assaulting them. And accusations dating back to 2005 and 2006 have also recently resurfaced. ""People should fact-check,"" Cosby told Florida Today. On Thursday, a woman from Florida came forward with allegations Cosby had drugged and raped her backstage at a show in Las Vegas in 1976. Therese Serignese, from Boca Raton, said the star made her take some pills that made her feel groggy and then sexually assaulted her. The 57-year-old's allegations are similar to those of other women, including former supermodel Janice Dickinson, who allege Cosby drugged them and then raped them over the past three decades. Meanwhile, Cosby received a warm reception at his show in Melbourne, Florida, on Friday. Some radio hosts had offered prizes to anyone who disrupted the show but just one protester stood outside the 2,000-seat theatre, holding a sign which read: ""Rape is no joke."" Several of Cosby's planned performances have been called off, including those in Oklahoma, Nevada, Illinois, Arizona, South Carolina and Washington. Cosby's lawyer, Martin Singer, said the accusations had ""escalated far past the point of absurdity"", dismissing them as ""unsubstantiated"", ""fantastical"" and ""uncorroborated"". Cosby has never been charged in connection with any of the allegations. NBC has shelved plans to revive Cosby's television career and repeats of his 1980s sitcom The Cosby Show were pulled from cable station TV Land earlier this week.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News The period drama, which earned him the best actor prize for his role as the stammering King George VI, also won best British independent film. Carey Mulligan won the award for best actress for her role in the big-screen adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguro's best-seller, Never Let Me Go. Both films will be released in the UK early next year. Firth called The King's Speech ""an improbable story about people who could have been consigned to the footnotes of history, and nobody's told it before. ""It was taken as a risk - somebody found the money - and I think it will pay off."" The film also took best supporting actor honours for Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush, with an additional prize going to screenwriter David Seidler. Yet Firth, who is attracting Oscar buzz for his role, refused to speculate on its chances during awards season. ""It could end tonight,"" he said. ""It's already punched above its weight. ""It already got noticed at the festivals, it's funnier than we thought, it has the capacity to make people cry. ""I can't project myself into glories that aren't in place yet."" Bonham Carter admitted she was ""slightly apprehensive"" about the attention surrounding the film. ""There's so much hype, I just hope people don't get immensely disappointed and resent it deeply when they see it,"" she told the BBC. The awards, known as the Bifas, were hosted by actor James Nesbitt and took place at Old Billingsgate Market in London. Bonham Carter was also presented with the Richard Harris award for outstanding contribution by an actor to British film. Elsewhere actor Liam Neeson received an award from variety magazine for his part in focusing the international spotlight on Britain. Monster success Carey Mulligan, Oscar nominated for last year's An Education, said she hadn't expected to win for Never Let Me Go. She admitted she had told her mother to stay at home instead of joining her at the ceremony, as she had done last year. ""Now I regret that,"" Mulligan said. ""But it's at home in London where I grew up, and to have a platform to talk about our small independent films is amazing."" Newcomer Gareth Edwards beat veteran Mike Leigh in the best director category for his low-budget film Monsters, which opened in UK cinemas this weekend. Monsters also won awards for best achievement in production and best visual effects, created by Edwards on a computer in his bedroom. ""I always wanted to make a monster movie,"" said Edwards. ""With my background in digital effects, I felt like an alien invasion and giant monsters weren't out of the question."" Yet he admitted feeling uncomfortable about beating the likes of Leigh, The King's Speech director Tom Hooper and Kick-Ass director Matthew Vaughn. ""I didn't want to make eye contact with anyone when I walked up there,"" he said. ""I feel embarrassed because they are heroes of mine. We made this small little film and these guys are going to go and win Oscars."" Joanne Froggatt, seen recently in ITV1's period drama Downton Abbey, picked up most promising newcomer for her debut film role in In Our Name. The film tells of a female soldier who returns from a tour of duty in Iraq with post-traumatic stress disorder. ""It means so much to me, but so much to our film as well,"" she said. ""We were on such a micro-budget and everybody worked so hard and became really passionate about the subject matter. ""I've been a professional actress for 14 years but this my first role in a film and it's also my first award for my acting,"" the former Coronation Street star added. ""So to have the two together is an absolute dream come true. With the success of Downton Abbey too this year has just been phenomenal.""

"By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter Now Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond have a new project - building a pyramid using bricks containing human remains. The pyramid's first brick, which was laid on Friday in Liverpool, contained the ashes of Cauty's artist brother Simon, who killed himself in 2016. ""I think it's a really fitting start to the whole project,"" Jimmy told the BBC. The pair staged a ceremony in Toxteth to lay the brick on the foundation stone, and invited other people to sign up to have their cremated remains sealed in their own brick after they die. The duo will need 34,592 bricks to complete the ambitious plan - which Jimmy Cauty admits could take around 300 years. ""I guess we're still a band as well,"" he says in a rare interview. ""It's interesting to be in a band that doesn't make records but only makes pyramids of dead people. ""It's easy to make it sound like a joke but it isn't a joke, it's deadly serious and it's a long-term project."" The band, who announced themselves in the charts with a number one as The Timelords in 1988, became known for their incendiary stunts as well as for their electrifying pop-trance hits. After burning the £1m on a remote Scottish island in 1994, they made the resulting ash into a brick. ""It was on seeing that that I decided I wanted to be made into a brick after I die,"" Jimmy says. The band also have a fascination with pyramids - there was one in the KLF logo - and at one point hoped to build a pyramid containing a brick for every person born in the 20th Century. But the idea for building a pyramid to commemorate the deceased came after Simon Cauty's funeral, which Jimmy says left him feeling as if there should have been ""something more"" to mark his death. ""He would really love the whole notion of being the first brick in the pyramid,"" Jimmy says. ""He knew that I wanted to be in a brick, right back to the '90s. It's a positive ending, and a positive beginning."" Simon Cauty, from Kingsbridge, Devon, worked closely with his brother and Drummond, helping them to create some of the sets and props for their elaborate videos and live shows. ""We had a very close creative relationship,"" Jimmy says. ""I'd say to Simon, 'Could you make for Bill and me a ceremonial horn that we could wear in the video?' And he would instantly know what that was and we wouldn't have to explain it to him. ""Or I could say, 'Look, we've got a Viking ship, could you make it look like it's just come all the way to America?' And he would just do that. ""I loved the things he did and the way he did them. Because we shared the same DNA, we had the same creative vision, so he's sorely missed."" Explaining why being turned into a brick might appeal to others, Jimmy says: ""Do you want to just disappear in a puff of smoke, or do you want to be part of something that is left behind? ""This pyramid could last for maybe 1,000 years. It's interesting to think that you could be part of something that could last for 1,000 years, even though nobody knows who you are or what your name is."" Each brick has a hole in the centre to hold 23g of cremated remains, which are sealed when the brick is fired. They have called the process MuMufication - a reference to the group's current name The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu as well as a play on ""mummification"". Fans queued on Friday to get in to Toxteth Town Hall, where they could sign up for MuMufication for £99 - or, to get the process moving, 99p if you are over 80 and live in the local area. Cauty and Drummond do need to find a permanent home for the 23ft (7m) People's Pyramid, however. The foundation stone and Simon's brick are currently being stored at The Florrie arts centre in Liverpool. ""I did get a message from The Florrie the other night after we'd left that the caretaker was worried that the brick was haunted,"" Jimmy says. ""But I said it's highly unlikely because I think he's probably moved on by now."" After a procession and ceremonial brick-laying on Friday, they have promised to stage an annual Toxteth Day Of The Dead to honour the pyramid as the number of bricks grows over the years. On 23 November 2017, the duo made the first in their series of public appearances in Liverpool to launch a novel. Cauty says they have been working in Toxteth for the past five years. But they are not working on new music - the pyramid scheme, which is being created with a range of local collaborators and Totnes-based The Green Funeral Company, has been occupying their time, he says. ""This is the thrust of pretty much everything and has been for nearly two years now since the funeral of Simon. Our job in the near future is to communicate the idea to as many people as possible.

"Beatles manager Brian Epstein and Monty Python's Graham Chapman are among those who will miss out. The scheme sees commemorative plaques attached to residences that famous personalities have lived in. English Heritage, which runs the scheme, said the cull was due to a 32% cut in government funding. It added that the decision to scrap some plaques was ""a matter of regret"". There are 40 famous names on the shortlist who will still receive a plaque, with some due to be honoured this year. A spokeswoman for English Heritage said it still had to get various permissions from home owners and local authorities - but that proposals usually get the go-ahead. 'Too early' Those who will receive a blue plaque in the future include Ava Gardner, David Niven and Peter Sellers. Others who will miss out include cellist Jaqueline du Pre and Lolita writer Vladimir Nabokov. The spokeswoman added that the shortlist would not be cut down any further. In a statement, English Heritage said a panel had reassessed the existing shortlist and that factors such as a limited association with London and the pre-existence of other plaques were taken into account. The panel noted that du Pre already had four plaques in London and that there was a private plaque for Epstein in central London, adding that it may be more appropriate to honour him further in Liverpool rather than London. The panel felt it was too soon to single out Chapman for commemoration ahead of his Monty Python colleagues, including John Cleese. There are numerous other plaque schemes in London, including various council schemes, trusts and societies. English Heritage said it hoped that ""where appropriate, alternative forms of commemoration may be found"".",Just under half of the blue plaques currently shortlisted to go up in London are being scrapped due to funding cuts.

"By Richard LattoBBC South producer But the BBC has uncovered a large collection of images for an exclusive online documentary about the strange movie, as producer Richard Latto explains. The Day the Clown Cried told the story of a fictional clown, Helmut Doork, who was thrown into prison and eventually used to entertain children and lead them into the concentration camp gas chambers. Lewis - at the peak of his career after success in The Nutty Professor and the Bell Boy - wrote and directed the film, and was at first very passionate about the idea. But perhaps even he eventually found the subject matter too harrowing. The film has never been released, with only a handful of people claiming to have seen anything from the production. Lewis himself avoids questions about it during interviews and public appearances. For the BBC documentary The Story of Day the Clown Cried, presenter David Schneider went to hear the stories of people close to the production, including the late Lars Amble, who played a Nazi guard. Amble remembers being asked to take part by Lewis: ""He was staying in Stockholm in a hotel. He called me up, I went to his room and suddenly he says I know which part you are going to have, a very mean guy. ""He was a very professional actor and director. He gave us all confidence."" Jack Kotschack was one of the producers. His son Erik remembers the period well when his father was working on the production. ""He was very thrilled to do this, to be part of it. When they made a decision to shoot the scenes from the concentration camp in Sweden, my father was the guy who made it possible. ""Jerry Lewis was big at that time. It was a big story for Sweden. He was a person who took [control of] the room, a big character and actor."" But the production was beset with problems and Kotschack says the working relationship between his father and Lewis fell apart. ""He sent a telegram 'to the smallest man in town from Jerry Lewis to Jack'. ""In the beginning they were best of friends but in the end not so."" There are many people on the internet who have circulated alleged copies of the script, and even some who have attempted to re-enact the entire film online. So what is the fascination with this project? ""This is a very interesting film because very few people have seen anything from it,"" says Jan Lumholdt, a film critic based in Sweden. ""He's a comedian and this is his most serious film ever. This gives it a very interesting energy and dynamic. ""I always felt that there are countless examples of great dark serious performers and dark work by comedians, there is a certain touch to it."" There have been many films about the Holocaust and it's often hard to come to terms with a fictional story set during this dark period in history. But Yael Fried, project manager of the Jewish Museum in Stockholm, is in favour of such projects. ""We need different ways and methods of understanding the Holocaust and fiction can help us with that,"" he says. ""You can use fictional characters in a real environment. I think you have to be careful and very clear that it's fiction."" It's rumoured by many that Lewis attempted to introduce moments of comedy into the production. The main character's name was seemingly changed from Karl Schmidt to Helmut Doork. ""As the child of a Holocaust survivor - my mother got out of Vienna in 1938 along with her playwright father and actress mother - the Holocaust was something that I have always been very aware of,"" says Schneider. ""As a comedian, I've always been fascinated by whether you can do comedy about such a difficult and taboo subject. ""I used to compere Jewish comedy gigs and I remember once getting a note passed to me backstage saying: 'We are a coach party of Auschwitz survivors come to see you. Please can you say hello to us during the gig?' ""And I just thought, what am I meant to do? Go on and shout: 'Hi, is there anybody from Auschwitz in the place tonight?' ""A lot of Jewish comedians found themselves exploring this area, just because it's so central to their identity."" The documentary also shares previously unseen archive footage of Lewis being interviewed on the set. ""Comedy is our safety valve, without it I think we would disappear, evaporate,"" he says. ""My philosophy of comedy is a man in trouble. There for the grace of God go I."" The Story of the Day the Clown Cried can be seen here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03dj9kr It will also be available on the BBC's YouTube page and is due to be broadcast on BBC TV at a future date.",In the early 1970s Hollywood actor Jerry Lewis started working on a Holocaust film so bizarre he ended up hiding all the footage and to this day it has never been seen.
"By Ian YoungsArts reporter In his first speech since becoming Arts Council chief executive, Darren Henley said cuts could halt recent progress in cultivating culture around the country. Speaking in Hull, he argued that the arts made a difference ""educationally, socially and economically"". Arts Council England has had its government grant cut by 36% since 2010. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to outline £30bn of spending cuts to government departments in his next budget in July. Mr Henley argued there had been ""cultural growth"" in cities like Hull, which will be UK City of Culture in 2017, over the last few years. He also pointed to recent initiatives like music education hubs, tax breaks for theatres and orchestras and investment in venues in Manchester. ""We appreciate this commitment in the government's first term,"" he said. ""But this progress is only sustainable with the long-term commitment of grant in aid. ""To have other success stories like Hull, we need the government to continue to make a significant commitment to arts and culture. ""At the Arts Council, we will make the best possible case to ensure government funding for the arts, for museums, and for libraries - which has already been cut so much since 2010."" He urged the government to follow the advice of the House of Commons culture select committee, which said last November that it would be ""disappointed"" if Arts Council England was cut further. 'Cataclysmic cuts' Mr Henley added: ""We'll have to impress upon people how we're in the business of providing opportunity to individuals and communities everywhere - educationally, socially and economically."" However many in the arts expect the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which funds the Arts Council and other bodies, to have its budget reduced. Speaking at a theatre debate on Saturday, Dave Moutrey, chief executive of Manchester's new venue Home, warned of the prospect of ""cataclysmic cuts"". At the same event, Arts Council England's north director Alison Clark Jenkins said that ""we can second guess that there will be further cuts"". Opportunities 'not everywhere' Meanwhile, Mr Henley has also announced that the Arts Council will give more National Lottery funding to organisations outside London. The share of Lottery funding going outside London will rise from 70% to 75%. Lottery money will also fund a new £35.2m ""ambition for excellence"" scheme to develop talent - of which £31.7m will go outside the capital. ""I believe that creative talent is everywhere,"" he said. ""But opportunity is not."" However, he added: ""I'm committed to maintaining London's status as a world capital of the arts. ""A flourishing London, with its arts and cultural organisations that serve the whole nation, is essential."" Analysis: BBC arts editor Will Gompertz I'd make two points. The Arts Council is clearly making a strategic shift to spend more money in the regions. However, it's only Lottery money - not core government funding, which would be a much bigger deal because it would mean removing substantial chunks from London. But it's definitely an indication that this is the direction of travel for the Arts Council in England. The second thing is the plea not to cut the arts. Darren Henley is making it in a city which is likely to benefit from a fairly significant investment in arts and culture. But I suspect the arts will have to take their share of the burden, as every other sector will across the board.","Arts and culture should be spared further funding cuts as the government seeks to balance the books, the new head of Arts Council England has said."
"German-born Scheffler is best known for his work on Julia Donaldson's books, including The Gruffalo series. ""I can't pretend it's business as usual. It's just 10 months until 'Freedom Day' - next March,"" he said. ""Worst-case scenario, I might not be allowed to stay here by the time my next book with Julia is launched."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The UK voted for Brexit by 52% to 48% in 2016. In December, a joint document issued by the UK government and the EU said both EU Citizens and UK nationals can continue ""to live, work or study as they currently do under the same conditions as under Union law"" after Brexit. Scheffler, who has made his views about Brexit known before, said: ""The UK has been my home for 36 years. There would have been no Gruffalo without the EU facilitating my study here. ""And, even if I had, somehow, studied in the UK, I would have had to leave after my studies ended in 1985. So there would never have been the successful Anglo-German joint venture Donaldson-Scheffler."" Scheffler said he was ""very grateful"" for the award and ""to the judges who chose me, a foreign EU citizen in Brexit times - that's a nice gesture"". He added: ""But I also accept it with a heavy heart and maybe even a slightly bitter feeling - it feels like a consolation prize. Or even a farewell gift."" The December document confirmed that EU and UK citizens have free movement of rights until the day the UK withdraws from the EU next year. This, in effect, is the cut-off date for EU citizens moving to the UK. Those who are yet to be granted permanent residency in the UK will have their rights protected, so they can still acquire it after withdrawal. The process for giving EU citizens residency rights in the UK will be under a new procedure, referred to as ""settled status"". Other winners at the British Book Awards included Philip Pullman, who was named author of the year for his ""outstanding"" success. The children's author was recognised after returning to the world of his Dark Materials with La Belle Sauvage last year. Awards organisers described Pullman as a ""true one-off"". Gail Honeyman won book of the year for her best-selling debut Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine. Judges said it was ""brilliantly written"" and ""the complete package"". The novel, which was the second biggest-selling debut of 2017, won the debut book of the year award and then beat six other category winners to be named overall book of the year. The winners across the seven categories for author of the year were: The judges of the British Book Awards, organised by The Bookseller, could not choose between two books in the children's category - and named them as joint winners. Young adult novel The Hate U Give, by Angie Thomas, tells the story of a 16-year-old drawn to activism after witnessing the police shooting of her unarmed friend.

"The actress said she ""won't be doing a full season"", while adding: ""But that doesn't mean I won't ever be back."" Peretti has played administrator Gina Linetti since the comedy series about a team of detectives in the New York City Police Department began in 2013. Earlier this year, the show was axed by the Fox network, only to be immediately picked up by NBC. The sixth season, which will run to 18 episodes, will air next year. Peretti thanked fans ""for the hours you spent watching Gina be Gina"", adding: ""It is hard for me to know exactly what to say."" In a follow-up tweet, she reposted the lengthy statement Emmy Rossum wrote when she announced she was leaving the US version of Shameless in August - but Peretti added her own ""extra relevant parts"" in bold. Rossum, who plays the eldest daughter of William H Macy's Frank Gallagher in Shameless, responded with a heart emoji. The mistress of the acerbic putdown and self-described ""human form of the 100 emoji"", Gina is a firm favourite among the comedy's die-hard fans. Her eventful time on the show has seen her lose her front teeth, survive being hit by a bus and have a baby with a character played by Ryan Phillippe. Peretti herself, who is also a comedian and writer, has one child with husband Jordan Peele, the Oscar-winning writer-director of horror hit Get Out. ""While it's sad to see a member of the family leave, we are so proud of Chelsea and excited for what she does next,"" the show's co-creator Dan Goor said.

"BBC One will show a special programme, Strictly Len Goodman, on Friday. The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive ""TV pickup"" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live. Jeremy Caplin, forecasting manager at the National Grid, told The Guardian that predicting electricity surges was determined simply by ""picking up the Radio Times and seeing what people are interested in"". He added: ""It is definitely art rather than science. Every morning somebody will go through the previous day and fill in the database to see what programme had a pickup. We can use that history to predict what will happen going forward."" The biggest Christmas Day TV pick-up of all time occurred in 1996, after a festive special of Only Fools and Horses. However, the biggest surge in electricity demand on Christmas Day comes not from watching TV, but cooking. The National Grid said the biggest demand is in the early afternoon as turkeys are roasted.

"Turn and Face the Strange is a live show written by Rupert Creed and Garry Burnett, both of whom are from Hull. The performance will incorporate film, audio, storytelling and live music. Ronson grew up in Hull, where he formed the band that went on to become the Spiders From Mars. He died in 1993 aged 46 after developing liver cancer. A spokesman for the project said Turn and Face the Strange would go ""beneath the known narratives of Mick Ronson's partnership with David Bowie and the Spiders from Mars"". He added: ""It will tell the story of how a working class boy from Greatfield Estate came to challenge the norms and expectations of his time and place of origin, to play a pivotal role in creating a new music and social culture."" As well as working with Bowie, Ronson recorded several solo albums, the most successful of which was Slaughter on 10th Avenue, which reached number nine on the UK album chart. He also played on, produced or arranged songs for artists including Lou Reed, Bob Dylan and Morrissey. The performance will be accompanied by an exhibition of photographs and memorabilia at the Freedom Centre. Creed said: ""The project will engage and connect Hull residents from Greatfield Estate and across the city, recording and sharing audio stories and memories, personal photographs and memorabilia. ""We will gather memories of gigs, record his impact as role model and icon on the lives of Hull residents and beyond."" The material gathered from archives as well as contributions from the public will then make up the content of the show, which will be performed in August 2017. Turn and Face the Strange will be one of 60 projects to take place in neighbourhoods across the city as part of the the Hull 2017 Creative Communities Programme. The 60 projects will share £750,000 funding. The full City of Culture line-up will be announced on Thursday.

"The Spanish actress's signing is seen as a boost to the follow-up, which has been in the pipeline for several years. Stiller is expected to reprise his central role and direct the new movie, which shifts the action 10 years on from the 2001 original. The news comes after a Dumb and Dumber sequel scored a box office hit 20 years after its first outing. Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell also had major roles in Zoolander, with Wilson playing Stiller's rival for supremacy on the catwalk. Ferrell took the role of sinister designer Jacobim Mugatu in the tongue-in-cheek glance into the world of fashion. However, according to Deadline, the two actors have yet to secure deals for the sequel and their return has only been rumoured. The script is being written by Justin Theroux, who is also writing the screenplay to HBO drama The Leftovers, which may have slowed progress on Zoolander's return. The original movie featured a whole host of cameo appearances from fashion luminaries including Claudia Schiffer, Tom Ford and Karl Lagerfeld. David Bowie played the judge in a ""walk-off"" between rivals Derek Zoolander and Wilson's Hansel McDonald. The main female role in the film, journalist Matilda Jeffries, was played by Christine Taylor - Stiller's wife - in the 2001 release.

"Juno Temple, Andrea Riseborough, Elizabeth Olsen, Alicia Vikander and Life of Pi actor Suraj Sharma have been tipped as the future stars of cinema. Previous winners include James McAvoy, Kristen Stewart and Tom Hardy. It is the only accolade voted for by the public and will be announced at the ceremony on 10 February. The judging panel, which included Pippa Harris, deputy chair of Bafta's film committee, director Kevin Macdonald, actor Benedict Cumberbatch and film critic Mark Kermode, selected the final five from hundreds of submissions made by film industry figures. Jury chairman Harris said they had ""a very tough job"" making their selections. British actress Juno Temple, 23, who attended the nominations launch at Bafta headquarters in London, said: ""I'm so honoured to be up there with this extraordinary young talent - people I'm inspired by and people whose films I go and see."" Temple's breakthrough role was in Notes on a Scandal (2006), alongside Cate Blanchett, and her other film appearances include Atonement (2007), The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and she appeared most recently with Matthew McConaughey in dark comedy Killer Joe. Temple said she had heard of the Rising Star award previously in her career, but never imagined she would be a nominee. ""It's about people looking at your body of work and congratulating what you've done. That's cool, because I've definitely made some choices that people are either going to love or hate. But I like that, it keeps people on their toes."" Temple's forthcoming movies include fantasy film Horns, in which she has been working with Daniel Radcliffe, and Disney film Maleficent, with Angelina Jolie. Elizabeth Olsen studied at Tisch School of the Arts before she took Sundance by storm in 2011 starring in acclaimed films Martha Marcy May Marlene and Silent House.

The 19-year-old had no acting experience prior to the role and was living with his parents in the suburbs of South Delhi. However, film critic Kermode insisted the Rising Star award was not strictly for newcomers. ""You can be someone who has a track record,"" he told the BBC.

"The trust set several conditions, including a commitment from BBC One and Two to broadcast more BBC Three programmes aimed at 16-34 year olds. It rejected proposals for a new BBC One+1 channel, which it said would be at the expense of commercial rivals. The trust also agreed to CBBC's running time being extended by two hours, running until 21:00. This follows a decline in viewers on CBBC in the last four years. The trust said it was clear ""the long-term future of broadcasting is online"" and that younger viewers - especially those under 25 - were already more likely to be watching TV that way. However it acknowledged that not all young people have access to good enough broadband connections to be able to watch entire programmes online, and that for many 16-34 year olds broadcast television was still important. It has approved proposals to revamp the iPlayer, evolving from what is primarily a catch-up service to one offering online-first content. It said the new-look BBC Three would be ""more distinctive"" than the current broadcast channel, which has seen audiences drop. BBC Three will spend 80% of its new £30m budget on documentaries such as Life and Death Row and long-form comedy shows like Bad Education and Cuckoo, instead of lighter formats such as Snog, Marry, Avoid. The other 20% of the budget will be spent on short-form content that will be housed online. Don't Tell the Bride has already been moved to BBC One and the channel has lost its most popular programmes Family Guy and American Dad to ITV2. The trust said the online move would initially lose the BBC viewers - a decline of 3% in 16-34 year olds - as while 90% of this age group have home broadband access, this varies in quality. Protests BBC Three is currently watched by 11.2 million people every week and reaches 25% of 16-24 year olds. However it is also currently the only BBC channel watched by 925,000 people in that age group - 80% of which are expected to be lost to the BBC with the closure. BBC Trust chairman Rona Fairhead said: ""We know young audiences are already moving towards the online future, but we do recognise that in the short term some of them will feel the immediate impact of the BBC Three proposals. ""We are therefore asking the BBC for commitments to ensure it uses the full range of its television services to better serve young people and others who make up BBC Three's audience."" Following protests from many of the channel's stars and some viewers, Ms Fairhead acknowledged that the BBC Three audience was ""passionate"" about its programmes. But she said the decision was ""finely balanced as a timing issue and a budget issue"" and had taken ""cost pressures into account"". ""The licence fee was frozen in 2010 and that cost pressure is starting to bite,"" she added. The trust's report said BBC Three was currently primarily a ""flicking channel"", which viewers stumbled upon by accident. As well as airing BBC Three programmes on BBC One and Two, the trust has also asked the executive to ensure that there is more space for ""risk-taking"" formats and nurturing new talent on traditional broadcast channels. It has also asked that the move is a ""gradual and well-managed transition"", to ensure there is awareness of the change and accessibility, with broadcast promotion. The trust has asked the BBC Executive to report back on its three conditions by 28 July - so that final decisions will be taken and published in the autumn. The yearly savings of £30m a year are expected to be ploughed into original BBC Drama, but the trust said it would ""encourage"" commissioners to focus on drama that would appeal to a younger audience. Repeats of programmes Extending CBBC's broadcasting hours, the trust's report found that TV reach peaks for 6-12 year olds between the hours of 19:00 and 21:00 when CBBC currently closes. It would fill this gap - made available by the closure of BBC Three - with repeats of programmes like Wolfblood and The Dumping Ground, rather than new programmes. The BBC Three budget for 2017/18 is expected to be £30m, half of its current budget. The Trust published its provisional conclusions after carrying out a Public Value Assessment and considering Ofcom's Market Impact Assessment (MIA). A BBC spokesperson said: ""We welcome the Trust's provisional conclusion, which is the next step in delivering our vision for a new BBC Three. ""With a frozen licence fee and the BBC's income cut by 26% we have had to make some very difficult choices, however our plans will allow us to innovate with new ideas and new forms of content for younger audiences. ""We'll now consider the areas the trust have asked us to address and respond in due course.""",Plans to move BBC Three online in January 2016 have been provisionally approved by the BBC Trust.
"But he faces strong competition from grime artists Stormzy and J Hus and rapper Loyle Carner, who each receive nominations for their debut albums. Their nominations come a year after Skepta took home the £25,000 prize, beating bookies' favourite David Bowie. Former winners The xx and Alt-J also make the 12-strong shortlist. Bookmakers have already made Sampha and Stormzy the favourites this year - putting Sheeran in the unusual position of being the underdog. Writing on Twitter, Stormzy - currently touring in Australia - said he was ""over the moon right now"". ""I put my heart, my soul and my absolute everything into making this album,"" he said of Gang Signs and Prayer. ""Giving God the glory."" The nomination of three British rap albums ""can only be seen as a positive thing,"" said Loyle Carner, who is shortlisted for his deeply personal, melancholy debut Yesterday's Gone. ""If people are writing rhymes and people across the world are listening to it, then that's a good thing."" J Hus, nominated for his amiable, genre-spanning Common Sense album, said he was confident grime could score two consecutive triumphs at the Mercury Prize. ""If I don't win it, hopefully Stormzy will win it,"" he told the BBC. ""We're really good friends, so it's a win-win either way."" The full list of nominees is: Read more about the shortlist and watch videos of the artists on BBC Music The shortlist was chosen by a panel of judges that includes Marcus Mumford, Jessie Ware, Ella Eyre, Radio 1's Clara Amfo and jazz musician Jamie Cullum. ""We were only allowed to talk about positive things,"" said Mumford of the deliberations, ""so I shut up quite a lot"". ""I actually found that difficult because I'm quite cynical,"" added Ella Eyre, ""But I think it's a good way to do it - focusing on the positives of an album. Initially."" Among the jury's selections are two albums that tell short stories about fictional characters. On Let Them Eat Chaos, poet Kate Tempest portrays the lives of seven sleepless citizens on one South London street. In How To Be A Human Being, meanwhile, Oxford band Glass Animals turn their eye to America with lyrics loosely inspired by people they met on tour. Many of the other nominees have written about family, with Stormzy and J Hus both dedicating songs to their mothers. Sheeran, meanwhile, closes his album with the touching ballad Supermarket Flowers, which reflects on the death of his grandmother and its effect on his parents. Notable omissions from this year's shortlist include Rag 'N' Bone Man's Human, Wiley's Godfather and Marika Hackman's I'm Not Your Man. Three-time nominee Laura Marling was also overlooked, despite rave reviews for her latest album Semper Femina. The winner will be announced at a gala concert at London's Eventim Apollo on 14 September. A controversial rule, which saw six of the nominated albums ""eliminated"" at the start of last year's ceremony, has been ditched for 2017. Analysis by Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter Ed Sheeran's name really sticks out on this year's Mercury shortlist. Amongst the jazz trumpeting of Dinosaur and performance poetry of Kate Tempest, he's a major household name who has sold more than 2 million copies of his record in just four months. Normally, the Mercury turns its nose up at this sort of commercialism. Adele's 25 didn't get nominated, Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams didn't get nominated... and, as many have pointed out, none of Ed's previous albums got nominated. So what's going on? The obvious answer is the panel were impressed by his writing. No one else has done more to dictate the sound of the Top 40 this year. Alongside his own hits, he's written Rita Ora's Your Song and Liam Payne's Strip That Down and spawned several imitators - from Shawn Mendes to Passenger. You could argue that his presence on the shortlist is robbing an under-exposed artist of the spotlight. But putting Sheeran alongside J Hus or The Big Moon could just as easily introduce those acts to a whole new audience. What seems certain is he won't win. Not since M People's victory in 1994 has a pop act been rewarded with the Mercury - and even David Bowie got shunted aside in favour of Skepta last year.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter at the Cannes Film Festival Having slapped on his sun hat and dusted down his tux, the BBC's Neil Smith is on the Croisette to bring you all the news, gossip and glamour from this annual cinema showcase. Follow his adventures here and on the entertainment news team's Twitter feed. MONDAY 16 MAY, 1730 BST (1830 LOCAL TIME) That's all from my Cannes diary this year, but we'll have plenty more news and features to bring you from the festival before it comes to a close this weekend. I'll leave you with my favourite poster from the Marche du Film, the bustling film market in which any film idea, however fanciful, can apparently be sold to someone. Bonne projection! MONDAY 16 MAY, 1300 BST (1400 LOCAL TIME) Expectations had been running high ahead of this morning's press screening of Loving, Jeff Nichols' film about an interracial couple from Virginia who faced prison in the '50s for getting married. Their plight led to a landmark Supreme Court decision that invalidated laws prohibiting interracial marriage. The story is one that could have generated any number of stirring courtroom declarations, triumphant exclamations of victory and other such clichés. Yet Nichols - whose previous features include the highly regarded Mud, Take Shelter and Midnight Special - takes a different tack, concentrating on the human struggle behind the headlines. He is aided by Joel Edgerton and Ruth Negga, both of whom give movingly understated performances as the couple whose surname gives the film its title, as well as a cameo from his regular collaborator Michael Shannon. Loving is a well-made, well-told and well-timed film from a director we'll all be hearing a lot more of in future. MONDAY 16 MAY, 1100 BST (1200 LOCAL TIME) (Pun alert) The Palm Dog is a charming Cannes tradition in which awards are presented each year to the festival's best canine performances. The prizes are given out at the end of the event. I suspect, however, the 2016 competition may already be ""Rover"". Say hi to Nellie, a slobbery English bulldog whose portrayal of Marvin in the new film from Jim Jarmusch could well see this dog have its day. Said mutt steals all the ""paw-dits"" in Paterson, a low-key character study that takes its name both from its main (human) character and the city where he resides. The film chronicles a week in the life of Paterson (Adam Driver), a New Jersey bus driver who has a secret life as a poet. Every day he gets up, kisses his wife and goes to work. Every night he takes the dog for a walk and downs a beer in his local tavern. The film is about the people he encounters, the conversations he overhears and the poems he never lets anyone read. Paterson is up for the Palme d'Or but is probably too minimalist and uneventful to walk away with the accolade. If Marvin isn't recognised at the Palm Dogs, though, it will be ""ruff justice"" indeed. MONDAY 16 MAY, 0800 BST (0900 LOCAL TIME) Remember that open-air screening of Prince film Purple Rain that had to be called off on Thursday due to inclement weather? Well, it had been thought the festival would try to show the film again on Sunday at its cinema on the beach. For reasons best known to Cannes director Thierry Fremaux, though, there was no Prince to be seen last night. Instead, the festival chose to project 1966 Palme d'Or recipient A Man and a Woman - a great film to be sure, but a lost opportunity all the same. The upshot is where the Berlin Film Festival had the opportunity to honour David Bowie, a chance to celebrate His Royal Funkiness was allowed to slip through Cannes' fingers. As he might have said (in French), ceci est ce que cela ressemble quand les colombes pleurent. SUNDAY 15 MAY, 1700 BST (1800 LOCAL TIME) Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling had a fine old time at the Nice Guys press conference, clowning for the cameras and responding to questions with a string of wisecracks. Crowe started off by using his mobile phone to take a picture of his co-star, much to the latter's mock displeasure. Here are some of other light-hearted moments from this afternoon's event: • Asked if he had ever used the Stanislavsky acting method, Crowe said he used ""the Russell Crowe method"". ""I have no [expletive] idea what the Stanislavsky method may be,"" he continued The Nice Guys is released in the US on Friday and in the UK on 3 June. SUNDAY 15 MAY, 1400 BST (1500 LOCAL TIME) Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are incompetent private eyes in The Nice Guys, a comic thriller from director Shane Black that's screening this weekend out of competition. They're thrown together in 1970s Los Angeles when they find themselves looking for the same girl, a politician's daughter caught in a conspiracy involving pollution, pornography and corporate malfeasance. Gosling displays great comic chops as a mustachioed buffoon who's always messing up, much to the dismay of his own teenage daughter. To my mind, though, there's nothing particularly nice about the film's endless profanity, cartoonish violence and depiction of women as disposable sex objects. Crowe and Gosling will be fielding questions from the press this afternoon, so stop back in a little while to find out what they said. SUNDAY 15 MAY, 1030 BST (1130 LOCAL TIME) There's more Shia LaBeouf - a lot more in fact - in American Honey, the fourth feature from British director Andrea Arnold. A road movie set in the US Midwest, it's one of only two UK titles in the main Cannes competition, the other being Ken Loach's I, Daniel Blake. The similarities don't end there, as both films have the same cinematographer in Ireland's Robbie Ryan. Yet his work on each film could hardly be more different, the unadorned naturalism of I, Daniel Blake being a world away from Honey's radiant, sun-soaked visuals. Arnold's film tells of a teenaged girl from a troubled home who has a life-changing rite of passage when she runs away with a travelling sales crew who sell magazine subscriptions door to door. Along the way she falls for her recruiter (LaBeouf), a fast-talking opportunist who will use any means necessary to make his sales quota. The film evokes an intoxicating atmosphere of hedonistic abandon and features a stand-out central performance from newcomer Sasha Lane. Like a number of the titles I've seen this year, though, it might have benefited from being just a little shorter. SUNDAY 15 MAY, 0800 BST (0900 LOCAL TIME) What with The BFG and all, Saturday was quite a busy day. Here are a few of the other things I got up to over the last 24 hours. Chat to Andy Serkis. The Lord of the Rings star was at a morning event hosted by our BBC Films colleagues to talk about Breathe, his next foray behind the camera. Starring Andrew Garfield and Clare Foy, this fact-based story of a man paralysed by polio in his twenties will be Serkis's second film as director after his version of The Jungle Book, an interpretation he says will be very different from the recent Disney adaptation. Chat to Joseph Fiennes. The Shakespeare in Love star popped into a function hosted by the Beijing International Film Festival to talk about The Last Race, an ""unofficial sequel"" to Chariots of Fire that explores the later years in the life of Olympic runner Eric Liddell. ""At the height of his fame Liddell went back to where he was born, China, to continue his missionary work,"" the actor explained. ""It's the part of Eric's life that people don't know, and a story that's never really been told."" Meet Sverrir Gudnason, the Swedish actor who'll be playing Bjorn Borg in a film about his rivalry with John McEnroe. Shia LaBeouf will play McEnroe in the tennis-based drama, which will focus on the run-up to the 1980 Wimbledon Final and co-star Stellan Skarsgard as Borg's coach. New balls, please... SATURDAY 14 MAY, 1800 BST (1900 LOCAL TIME) The biggest smile at today's press conference for The BFG came from Ruby Barnhill, the young actress chosen to play the female lead in Steven Spielberg's Roald Dahl adaption. ""It's amazing to know you've been cast in such an incredible and magical film,"" the 11-year-old beamed. ""It's a dream come true and it's so incredible to be in Cannes."" Barnhill is just one Brit in a cast that includes Mark Rylance, Rebecca Hall and Penelope Wilton as The Queen. ""This is one movie you do not want to cast American actors in,"" joked Spielberg, adding that he had imagined the grilling he would have faced in Britain had he gone down that route. In one scene in the film, Wilton's Queen drinks a magical libation that makes her (and her corgis) excessively flatulent. The Downton Abbey star suggested it was amusing to see the Queen placed in unfamiliar situations, while suggesting her ""wonderful sense of humour"" would allow her to see the funny side. ""We'll see what the Queen thinks when the time comes, won't we?"" laughed her director. A more sombre note was struck by one journalist, who asked Spielberg where movies like his fitted in a world full of homelessness and inequality. ""All of us have to believe in magic,"" the Jaws director responded. ""The worse the world gets, the more magic we have to believe in. ""That magic will give us hope, and that hope will cause us to be proactive in a world that needs our attention more than it ever has."" The BFG is out in the UK later this year. SATURDAY 14 MAY, 1430 BST (1530 LOCAL TIME) The sun came out for Steven Spielberg for the Cannes premiere of The BFG, his big-screen version of Roald Dahl's much-loved story about the Big Friendly Giant and the little girl who befriends him. Like 1982's ET before it, the film tells of a bond between a human child and an other-worldly being - in this case a giant who comes out at night to harvest and distribute dreams. Written by the same person who penned ET, the late Melissa Mathison, Spielberg's latest whisks the audience away to a magnificently realised Giant Country, where the BFG - played by Mark Rylance through a combination of motion capture and special effects - is himself dwarfed by giants of a far less amicable temperament. When the nasty giants endanger the human realm, young heroine Sophie - a character named after Dahl's first granddaughter - enlists the aid of Her Majester the Queenie (Penelope Wilton), leading to a visit by the BFG to Buckingham Palace that is the film's stand-out comic set-piece. Though occasionally as ponderous as Rylance's delivery of his giant's malapropism-laden dialogue, The BFG is a charmer that will entrance children around the world. If the film received a slightly muted response at today's press screening, it might be down to Dahl's fondness for the made-up word - a penchant that necessitates the inclusion of a glossary in the movie's accompanying press material. You have to feel for the poor subtitle writers who had to find a French equivalent for ""delumptious"", ""frobscottle"" and ""telly-telly bunkum box"". We'll have more from Spielberg and Rylance later, so stay tuned. SATURDAY 14 MAY, 0900 BST (1000 LOCAL TIME) Lily-Rose Depp, daughter of Johnny Depp and his former partner Vanessa Paradis, was cheered on by her mother last night at the premiere of a film in which she has a starring role. Lily-Rose, 16, appears in The Dancer as Isadora Duncan, the celebrated performer who died so tragically, not very far from here, in 1927. The Dancer, though, catches Duncan at the start of her ascent, when she was taken under the wing of one Loie Fuller in 1900s Paris. Born in the American Midwest, Fuller enjoyed remarkable if now largely forgotten success with a ""serpentine dance"" that saw her create exotic, butterfly-like shapes on stage from inside a flowing silk gown. Fuller's career, slightly fictionalised, is the true subject of Stephanie Di Giusto's film, an elegant if conventional biopic that could have used some of the daring seen in the aforementioned Neruda. Kudos, though, to singer turned actress Soko - real name Stephanie Sokolinski - for the intensity and commitment with which she brings Fuller back to life. The Dancer, which screened in Cannes under the Un Certain Regard banner, will receive a full French release in September. FRIDAY 13 MAY, 1745 BST (1845 LOCAL TIME) It was a good story. No, it was a great story. Sadly, it doesn't appear to be a totally TRUE story. Yes, we're talking about Dionne Warwick's announcement earlier today that Lady Gaga would be playing Cilla Black in a film about her life. Unfortunately, no one appeared to have mentioned this to Gaga herself, whose involvement in the project has since been denied by her publicist. Surprise, surprise indeed. FRIDAY 13 MAY, 1700 BST (1800 LOCAL TIME) Ken Loach's latest film is in the main competition line-up, so it has a chance of winning the prestigious Palme d'Or award. But there are many different sections and sidebars in Cannes that go beyond the 21 films in contention for its main prizes. Café Society and Money Monster, for example, played out of competition, meaning they got lots of publicity without having to face scrutiny from a jury. (Julia Roberts certainly helped that last night by climbing the steps of the Grand Theatre Lumiere barefoot - interpreted by many as a statement in the light of reports that women were turned away from premieres last year for not wearing heels.) Then there are the films in the Un Certain Regard sidebar, not to mention those picked to appear under the Directors' Fortnight and International Critics' Week banners. After that you have the special screenings, the midnight screenings, and the so-called Cannes Classics. And beyond those there is the Marche du Film, a bustling shop window for films both finished and in the pipeline that holds its own slew of screenings at various locales across town. What this means is that no one at the festival will ever see everything they would like or intend to see. So a lot of times you end up going with your gut - which is what I did this morning when I went to see Neruda, one of the films in the Directors' Fortnight section. The good news for me is that my gamble paid off, Pablo Larrain's biopic of the Chilean politician and poet Pablo Neruda proving witty, intelligent and seductive. I'm no expert when it comes to Neruda's poetry, but I certainly intend to become better informed once the festival is over. Part of what makes the film interesting is its approach to its subject, seen here in the late 1940s when his communist sympathies saw him ostracised and persecuted by the Chilean authorities. They're represented here by a dogged yet incompetent policeman, played by Gael Garcia Bernal, who becomes obsessed with Neruda to the point of distraction. Throw in cameos from Pablo Picasso and Augusto Pinochet and you have an unusual and unconventional portrait of an artist. I hope to be making many more such discoveries as the festival continues. FRIDAY 13 MAY, 1430 BST (1530 LOCAL TIME) ""Wow!"" muttered Ken Loach this lunchtime as his arrival at the official press conference for his latest film was met with a sustained round of applause. I, Daniel Blake, his new feature, had clearly struck a chord with its depiction of a Geordie carpenter who finds himself on the breadline after suffering a heart attack. Loach said it was ""shocking"" that, 50 years on from his seminal TV drama Cathy Come Home, there were still stories of social inequality and injustice waiting to be told. ""There is a conscious cruelty in the way we're organising our lives,"" he told reporters on Friday. ""The most vulnerable people [in society] are [being] told their poverty is their own fault."" Writer Paul Laverty went further, suggesting there was a ""propaganda campaign"" at work ""to denigrate everyone on welfare."" ""There's nothing accidental about it, and it's affecting a huge section of the population."" Loach also brushed off a suggestion that his latest film might be his swansong, muttering: ""I don't know about that."" FRIDAY 13 MAY, 1030 BST (1130 LOCAL TIME) Dionne Warwick wafted into Cannes this morning to announce a film is to be made about her life. LeToya Luckett, an original member of Destiny's Child, will play the singer in Dionne in which Lady Gaga will also appear as Cilla Black. Warwick and Black had quite the rivalry back in the day, particularly when Cilla's version of Anyone Who Had a Heart eclipsed Dionne's original. Asked on Friday why she regarded Black as her nemesis, Warwick said it was ""because she stole my music"". Danny Glover will lay Dionne Warwick's father in the film. Mario von Peebles is in talks to direct. Oscar winner Olympia Dukakis is also lined up to appear as Marlene Dietrich, whose mentoring of Warwick earned her the nickname ""Momma"". The film will be based on Warwick's own autobiography, entitled My Life, As I See It. FRIDAY 13 MAY, 0800 BST (0900 LOCAL TIME) Prince fans were left disappointed last night when an open-air tribute screening of the late pop star's 1984 film Purple Rain was called off at short notice. High winds prevented the public screening going ahead on the beach - though it is hoped a second showing on Sunday will have a happier outcome. It's the kind of thing that happens at Cannes, a place where plans can change at the drop of a sun hat and one never quite knows who one is going to bump into next. While entering a hotel on Thursday, for example, I found myself just one revolving glass pane away from Mads Mikkelsen, Danish star of Casino Royale and Hannibal and a member of this year's Palme d'Or jury. One celebrity encounter I missed out on last night was with Kendall Jenner, one of those Kardashians we're all supposed to be keeping up with. Now that's what I called a missed opportunity. I would have dearly loved to have known what she made of the opening night film in this years' Directors' Fortnight. THURSDAY 12 MAY, 1800 BST (1900 LOCAL TIME) I, Daniel Blake, the new film from Britain's Ken Loach, is an angry howl at the welfare system and the bureaucracy involved in obtaining benefits payments. Its titular hero - amusingly and touchingly played by stand-up comic Dave Johns - is a skilled joiner with a heart condition who has been signed off work by his doctor but who is still deemed fit to work by the Department of Work and Pensions. Cast adrift in a sea of red tape, food banks and forms that can only be filled out online, this 59-year-old Geordie finds both poverty and desperation knocking at his door. His plight is mirrored by that of Katie (pictured), a single mother from London with her own battles against a system that is baldly depicted as insensitive, unhelpful and often openly hostile. There are clear links here to Cathy Come Home, Loach's influential 1966 TV play about another mother who falls on hard times. Half a century on, I, Daniel Blake shows the 79-year-old director's eye for social injustice is as acute and unblinking as ever. Interestingly, the film's press screening this afternoon came with two sets of subtitles - French and English. Were festival organisers fearful that the film's thick Newcastle accents would be hard to make out? THURSDAY 12 MAY, 1400 BST (1500 LOCAL TIME) George Clooney, Julia Roberts and Jodie Foster make a stellar trio in anyone's book. Small wonder they've been invited to Cannes to bring some more Hollywood glamour - oh, and a film - to this year's event. The film is called Money Monster, a satire-cum-thriller in which a smart-aleck presenter of a financial-advice TV show, played by Clooney, gets his comeuppance live on air. It comes in the rather too topical form of a vengeful investor, played by Britain's Jack O'Connell, who hijacks the show at gunpoint and forces its host to don an explosive-laden vest. The hostage taker demands that the show remains on air, forcing Clooney's producer - Roberts' role - to double up as high-stakes negotiator. The show, of course, becomes an international talking point, for all the New York Police Department's attempts to keep a lid on the situation. Things get a lot sillier from there, though Jodie Foster - directing here rather than starring - deserves some credit for keeping so many balls in the air at once. Clooney, alas, isn't really in his element as a flamboyant TV star whose thirst for ratings makes him behave more akin to a circus ringmaster. Ofcom, meanwhile, would have a field day with the number of F-words that go out unbleeped. Haven't they heard of a 10-second delay? THURSDAY 12 MAY, 1200 BST (1300 LOCAL TIME) Jesse Eisenberg had only good things to say about the London theatre scene this morning while doing the promotional rounds for Woody Allen's Cafe Society. The Batman v Superman star is shortly to make his West End debut in his own play The Spoils, which opens later this month at the Trafalgar Studios. ""I love theatre in England; it's the most unusual theatre scene, even more unique than New York, because it has more interesting, government-funded shows. ""They're able to do bigger-budget, more obscure theatre than when it has to be independently produced and they have to get stars to be in it. ""I was very happy to hear they wanted to do my play; I would have done it anywhere. ""But I feel very lucky to do it in such a Mecca of great theatre like London."" THURSDAY 12 MAY, 0730 BST (0830 LOCAL TIME) There had been talk ahead of this year's festival that security would be ramped up in the light of last year's attacks in Paris and fears that Cannes too might be targeted. Apart from being subjected to the occasional sweep with a hand-held metal detector, though, I haven't noticed any particular escalation in the usual building entry procedures. The festival's first day was dampened somewhat by a heavy shower that had people on the Croisette scurrying for shelter. But it didn't stop the opening night ceremony going ahead as scheduled, as these photos from the red carpet show. WEDNESDAY 11 MAY, 1700 BST (1800 LOCAL TIME) ""Life isn't all cupcakes and rainbows, you know."" No, not Woody Allen again, but Justin Timberlake in his latest role as a glum troll named Branch in the latest animation from the DreamWorks stable. Called Trolls, the film tells of a cheerful little creature called Poppy (Anna Kendrick) who spends her days singing, laughing and hugging the other denizens of her magical, candy-coloured world. Until, that is, a nasty ogre makes off with some of her friends, forcing her to embark on a rescue mission with a reluctant Branch on tow. Festival attendees were given a preview earlier of some footage from the film, ahead of its release in the autumn. They were also given a treat: Timberlake and Kendrick performing an acoustic version of Cyndi Lauper's True Colours, one of the songs that appears in the film. Justin will be at the Eurovision Song Contest this weekend to sing Can't Stop the Feeling, another song from the Trolls soundtrack. I guess we should consider this a warm-up. WEDNESDAY 11 MAY, 1400 BST (1500 LOCAL TIME) Woody Allen was on predictably mordant form at today's Café Society press conference, describing life as ""fraught with peril, sadness and cruelty"". ""You can look at life as amusing with a farcical element to it,"" he told journalists. ""But it can also be very sad if you penetrate it."" The veteran director also had some slightly prescriptive words for stars who complain about press intrusion into their private lives. ""Celebrities often kvetch about the lack of privacy and the paparazzi but these are not life-threatening problems,"" he went on. ""There are upsides and downsides to fame, but the perks outweigh the downsides."" Café Society, like several of Woody's films, involves a relationship between an older man and a younger woman - a recurring trope that a couple of (female) journalists gently took him to task about. Allen, though, said he ""wouldn't hesitate"" to write a film in which the ages were reversed, but said it was ""not a commonly seen thing"". ""It's a perfectly valid idea to have the age difference in that direction,"" he said as he sat on a dais between Kristen Stewart, 26, and Blake Lively, 28. ""I just don't have the experience or the material to draw on."" I'll be spending some more time with Allen and his cast tomorrow, so make sure you stop by. WEDNESDAY 11 MAY, 0001 BST (0101 LOCAL TIME) Woody Allen is no stranger to Cannes. Café Society is the 14th of his films to screen at the festival and the third one to launch it. A nostalgic throwback to the glamorous nightclubs and pool parties of 1930s New York and Hollywood, it's a wistful story of thwarted romance that Allen himself narrates. Its hero is Bobby Dorfman (Jesse Eisenberg), a naïve rube from the Bronx who travels to Los Angeles in the hope of getting a job from his hotshot agent uncle (Steve Carell). He quickly falls in love with his uncle's secretary (Kristen Stewart), only to discover she has a boyfriend to whom she is devoted. Can Bobby win her heart? Or will 'Vonnie' - short for Veronica - choose to stay with her lover, even it means breaking up his marriage? It's one of several moral dilemmas Allen toys with in a film which has a central theme of how the choices we make shape, steer and, in some cases, cut short our lives. Sumptuously photographed by Vittorio Storaro, Café Society is a gentle, meandering tale that revels in Manhattan's after-hours world of cocktails and jazz bars. Curiously, though, it also contains isolated scenes of mob-related violence that one would more readily associate with Martin Scorsese than its 80-year-old director. I suspect the Cannes critics will be perplexed by a picture that, like a lot of Allen's recent work, falls somewhere between playful comedy and thoughtful drama. But I'm sure they'll laugh as heartily as I did when one character remarks that one should ""live every day as if it's your last - because some day, you'll be right"". Café Society will open the Cannes Film Festival later and is out in the UK in September.","The 69th edition of the Cannes Film Festival, one of the key events in the international entertainment calendar, is taking place in the south of France."
"Phoenix, 37, told Interview Magazine: ""I don't want to be a part of it. I don't believe in it."" The actor has been tipped for awards success The Master, in which he plays a war veteran. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role as music legend Johnny Cash in Walk The Line in 2005. Phoenix said he was dreading the upcoming Hollywood awards season which culminates with the Oscars in February 2013. ""It's a carrot, but it's the worst-tasting carrot I've ever tasted in my whole life. I don't want this carrot,"" he said. ""Stupidest thing"" ""It's totally subjective. Pitting people against each other....It's the stupidest thing in the whole world."" Phoenix described the period when Walk The Line was up for multiple awards seven years ago as ""one of the most uncomfortable periods of my life."" ""I never want to have that experience again,"" he revealed in the interview. ""I don't know how to explain it - and it's not like I'm in this place where I think I'm just above it - but I just don't ever want to get comfortable with that part of things."" The Master, which also stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, is Phoenix's first feature film since I'm Still Here, Casey Affleck's spoof 2010 documentary which chronicled Phoenix's supposed retirement from acting to launch a career as a rapper. Phoenix called that experience ""unbelievably liberating"" and said it was hard subsequently to find projects that interested and excited him. ""I mean, everything that they teach you when you're a kid about acting is completely...wrong. They tell you to memorise your lines, follow your light, and hit your marks. Those are the three things that you shouldn't do. ""You should not learn your lines, you should not hit your mark, and you should never follow your light. Find your light - that's my opinion,"" he said.","Joaquin Phoenix has said he wants no part in the movie industry awards season, calling the awards ""stupid"" and ""subjective""."
"By Genevieve HassanEntertainment reporter, BBC News More than 20 British films are being screened as part of the festivities featuring the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet and Timothy Spall. There's also a host of other British talent appearing at the festival, in front of the camera and behind it. Here is a look at some of the British films likely to create a buzz in the Canadian city. The Imitation Game Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Alan Turing in the drama which follows how the British computing pioneer cracked the German Enigma codes during World War Two. After opening last year's festival with the critically panned WikiLeaks film The Fifth Estate, the Sherlock actor will be hoping his latest film is better received. Keira Knightly co-stars as Turing's friend and fellow codebreaker Joan Clarke. The film will also open the London Film Festival in October. The Theory of Everything The life of celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking is told in The Theory of Everything, based on the memoir by his wife Jane. Les Miserables star Eddie Redmayne stars as Hawking opposite Felicity Jones, beginning with their meeting at Cambridge University before the scientist was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. Benedict Cumberbatch also starred as Hawking in a 2004 BBC film which saw Bafta TV nominations for both the drama and the actor. Redmayne's performance could also see him highly recognised when the major award nominations are announced next year. The Riot Club A big screen adaptation of the hit West End play Posh, The Riot Club is a fictionalised version of Oxford University's Bullingdon Club - the exclusive society known for its boisterous behaviour. Max Irons (son of Jeremy), Hunger Games' Sam Claflin and Romeo and Juliet's Douglas Booth star as some of the students selected to join the elite dining club full of Hooray Henrys. British Prime Minister David Cameron and London Mayor Boris Johnson are noted as previous members of the real club - although whether the activities back in their day were as riotous as their fictional counterparts remains to be seen. Mr Turner Mike Leigh's biopic about the celebrated painter JMW Turner was met with acclaim when it screened in Cannes earlier this year. Star Timothy Spall told the BBC News website he was ""very pleased"" the movie was showing in Toronto. ""I'm obviously very apprehensive about how it's going to go down to a new audience, but I'm absolutely delighted with what people are saying about the film,"" he said. Spall's son Rafe will also be attending the festival with his own film, X+Y. ""We often meet at places like [festivals]. We had a lovely time when we worked together in Florence - we went out to dinner every night,"" the elder Spall said. X+Y Rafe Spall stars as an anarchic maths teacher in this film about an autistic maths prodigy played by Ender's Game star Asa Butterfield (pictured above). Inspired by the 2007 BBC documentary Beautiful Young Minds, it follows socially awkward teen Nathan as he competes on the British team at the International Mathematics Olympiad. It is the fiction feature debut from Bafta-winning film-maker Morgan Matthews, who also directed the original documentary. Sally Hawkins and Eddie Marsan also star. A Little Chaos This period drama has been given the honour of closing the festival. It sees Alan Rickman make his second directorial effort while also starring in front of the camera as King Louis XIV. It also stars Oscar winner Kate Winslet as a landscaper invited to design one of the fountains at the Palace of Versailles, with support from The Devil Wears Prada actor Stanley Tucci. It is not due for release in the UK until February 2015. Other British talent The festival runs 4 - 14 September.",The 39th Toronto International Film Festival is due to begin later with Robert Downey Jr film The Judge opening proceedings.
"By Kev GeogheganEntertainment reporter, BBC News ""His jetlag is kicking in,"" explains a cheerful PR man. ""But he's been on good form so you should get some good stuff from him."" Just what a journalist wants to hear 15 minutes before an interview with Nicolas Winding Refn, the enfant terrible of European arthouse cinema whose latest film, Only God Forgives, sees him team up for the second time with Hollywood golden boy Ryan Gosling. The film, a neon-splashed, hyper-violent noir set in Bangkok, sees Gosling's gangster Julian tasked by his drug kingpin mother to exact bloody revenge on the men who killed his older brother. Refn introduced a screening of the film the night before our interview by suggesting that where Drive, his previous film with Gosling, had been ""high-grade cocaine, then this film is the opposite, like really bad acid"". Fast forward 12 hours. ""Hi,"" says the visibly weary director. ""Do you mind if I walk about a bit?"" ""Not at all,"" I answer. ""Can you expand on the drugs simile you used to explain the film last night?"" ""Why? Was it not true?"" Hmm, this could get difficult. ""It was a way,"" says Refn, ""to describe..."" (eight second pause) ""...a film that had a certain anticipation."" This could be a long 20 minutes. Refn is now sprawled on one of the hotel's comfortable-looking couches, his dark sunglasses shielding what I suspect are half-closed eyes. ""And does that anticipation help or hinder you as a storyteller?"" I inquire. Another long pause. ""People can be pleasantly surprised or they can be disappointed, but that love and hate is what art is all about,"" he eventually says. Another pause, this time I hope for dramatic effect. ""There's a great satisfaction of being able to cause that stir emotionally within you,"" he finally adds. 'Good and bad art' Art, it transpires, is a subject Refn is happy to talk about - at length. His answers are largely prompted by an enquiry on the mixed reaction Only God Forgives received when it was screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in May. ""We live in a society where we define our art as good or bad, and in a way art needs to be beyond that,"" says Refn. ""Whether it's good or bad it's almost irrelevant. ""It's like saying, 'I had good or bad Chinese food last night.' It's easy to understand that, but how can you define art that way?"" The level of violence in Only God Forgives has earned it an R rating in the US and an 18 certificate in the UK. For Refn, it is an artistic thumb of the nose to Hollywood suits at a time when film-makers are commonly asked to cut violence from films to reach a bigger audience. ""I make my films very cheap,"" he sighs. ""And that's really how you retain your control, with your budget. ""The cheaper you make the films, the less of a challenge it is and the less people want to involve themselves. ""If you're making a hundred million dollar movie, you have to make half a billion dollars for your investors to be happy. ""A film like Drive"" - another crime thriller in which Gosling played a stuntman who moonlights as a getaway driver - ""only needs to make two million dollars, and everyone has made back their money."" 'Fantasy reality' Stylistically, Only God Forgives owes much to the work of Martin Scorsese, Sir Ridley Scott and in particular John Carpenter, most famous for directing films like Halloween and Escape from New York. ""Those are the films I grew up with,"" says Refn. ""Especially Escape from New York - that kind of futuristic world that's in the near future, an almost alternative reality, a fantasy reality. ""I think Escape from New York was the first VHS video I ever owned,"" continues the director, now in a full-blown tribute to Carpenter's dystopian vision of the Big Apple as a high-security prison. ""God, I loved that movie. It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulse-y beat."" Audiences familiar with Drive will know that Gosling is not an actor whom Refn overburdens with dialogue. Compared with the taciturn Julian in Only God Forgives, though, Gosling's unnamed driver in that 2011 film was positively brimming with enthusiastic chatter. ""Being able to convey all these emotions without having to talk is a fantastic gift,"" Refn says of his tight-lipped star. From British actress Kristin Scott Thomas, meanwhile, Refn has drawn one of this year's most startling performances by casting her as Julian's platinum blonde, foul-mouthed mother Crystal. ""It came very natural to her, let me put it like that,"" smiles Refn. ""She had no problem turning on the bitch switch. ""Ryan was very helpful with that because I'm not well-versed in American foul language. So I asked for his help."" 'Like the Sex Pistols' The film's brutal violence has divided audiences thus far and saw it met with booing and applause in equal measures when it screened at Cannes. ""What was great about Cannes, it became like the Sex Pistols,"" says Refn. ""People were either outraged beyond belief or they praised it beyond the second coming. ""That's when you know you have penetrated the deepest souls of humanity."" When I point out that first screening at Cannes was similar to the Pistols' Free Trade Hall gig in 1976, in that everyone has since claimed that they were there to witness it, he chuckles. ""Yes, they can all refer to that reaction that it 'split' critics or had 'diverse' reactions."" Violence runs like a red seam through many of the director's films, which include the Denmark-set Pusher series and a biopic of Britain's most notorious prison inmate, Charles Bronson. Yet Refn insists that Only God Forgives, even with its limb-chopping, eye-gouging and head-bashing, is not particularly violent. ""I used to enjoy violent movies when I was younger and didn't have any children,"" he says. ""Since having children I became very aware of the effect, but I don't consider my films to be very violent - not compared to what you see on television."" So is creating violent images something of a catharsis for a former horror junkie whose kids have curtailed his viewing habits? ""Unfortunately, I don't have any problems with coming up with violent images,"" he explains. ""It comes very natural to me. ""I used to seek out any extreme cinema that I could get my hands on. It used to be something that I took great pride in."" Refn is currently working on an adaptation of the erotic comic book Barbarella, adapted by director Roger Vadim for a 1968 film starring his then-wife Jane Fonda.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The R&B star's first three albums form a pointed dialogue about freedom, class, and acceptance - albeit in a futuristic, sci-fi setting. Her latest record, though, is firmly rooted in the present day, with the star responding to the political and social upheavals in the US. ""There were a lot of times I would stop recording [and] I would be deeply upset, angry,"" she told BBC Radio 1. ""Living over in America and feeling like the people I love were pushed to the margins of society by the leader of the free world and that regime. ""You do have to stand up for those who can't often stand up for themselves - so I do feel a responsibility to knock the hell out of the bully."" 'We are on a shift change' The star set out her stall with the album's first single, Django Jane, a bold, street-smart banger packed with political and feminist discourse. ""They been trying hard just to make us all vanish,"" she raps at one point. ""I suggest they put a flag on a whole 'nother planet"". The star said she'd recorded the song as a ""response to the sting of feeling like my rights as a young black woman... are constantly being trampled on"". ""I'm angry at many of the things that I hear coming out of the mouths of people in the position of power,"" she told Annie Mac. ""I'm tired of the abuse of power. I'm tired of so many things. ""But at the end of the day, I do believe that we are on a shift change. Women are uniting, we're realising we're stronger together, we're more powerful together, that we really can get [things] done when we are aligned - and so Django Jane was important to say that."" The star isn't just making these statements in her lyrics. Django Jane feels like a companion piece to her recent screen roles in Moonlight and Hidden Figures, while Monae's Fem The Future movement predates both Me Too and Time's Up. The star also addressed sexual inequality with an impassioned speech at this year's Grammy Awards, telling the gathered executives: ""We come in peace, but we mean business."" Looking back on the moment, she remembers feeling ""nervous but eager"" about taking a stand. But her speech was quickly overshadowed by Grammy chief Neil Portnow who, asked about the lack of female winners at the ceremony, commented that women ""need to step up"". Monae counters that the industry needs ""systemic"" and ""structural"" changes to promote and protect women. 'Men need to stand up' ""It's not like we don't have the talent to be music producers or engineers or run record labels,"" she told Radio 1. ""It's the lack of opportunity, it's the lack of hiring, it's the lack of having women present in these rooms helping make these decisions. ""Statistics already show that when women are in positions of power, sexual harassment go down immensely. ""We really are going to have to have conversations - not just as women, but the men are going to have to have these conversations with us, ""They're going to have to ally up with us, they're going to have to check each other in these boys' club rooms, they're going to have to stand up for us in ways that I don't think they have. ""And this is not to group all men together - 'cause not every man is the problem - but you need to recognise the problem and be unafraid to check the problem."" Monae has promoted her new album, Dirty Computer, with a dramatic trailer attached to Marvel's blockbuster superhero film Black Panther. But the first taste of the music came at a private listening party last week. Dressed in her trademark black and white, the 32-year-old took over a bar in central London, dancing her way through a crowd of specially-invited guests, and pulling some (mostly) willing volunteers up to gyrate alongside her. The event showcased the fun side of the album, which sees Monae exploring sexual liberation as often as her politics, channelling the spirit of her mentor and former collaborator, Prince. ""Having his support and his belief and his confidence meant everything to me,"" she told Annie Mac. ""He never tried to encourage me to be like him, or to write music like him. It was always, 'You have something special. I'm here if you need me, but I love what it is that you do.'"" But she also confessed to being frightened by the star's stage presence as a child. ""Prince, you know growing up, was always other-worldly to me, to a point where I was scared of him. ""When I would see his videos on TV they would make me very scared and mainly because I just had never seen a black man express himself in the way that Prince did. He was so free. ""And maybe it was because I was scared of myself. Maybe it was like something that I saw in him that I wasn't ready to tap into and I think it's that freedom. ""You got that when you looked at him, when you listened to him."" The single Make Me Feel, released at the same time as Django Jane, sounds like Monae's tribute to Prince - full of choppy guitar licks and wibbly 80s synths, with lyrical nods to the star's free, and fluid, exploration of sexuality. Monae says her aim with the album is to celebrate people who've been ""pushed to the margins of society"". ""I wanted to make an album for all the dirty computers of the world,"" she said. ""Those who are told that they have bugs and viruses, that they need to fix themselves, that they need to clean themselves. ""Dirty computers [should] see their bugs and viruses as attributes, as features, as characteristics that help make society great and inclusive. ""Great art comes when we're able to all come together. That's where the magic happens, that's where you start understanding one another. ""And if you're understanding, you start liking each other, and through liking, you start uniting."" Dirty Computer will be released on 27 April.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Anika Kotecha is remembering the Michael Jackson she knew. The one she visited at Neverland, and who used to phone her up to marvel at her trips to the supermarket. ""He'd go, 'You went to the shops? Oh wow, what was that like?' ""And for me, I just went to pick up some bread and milk, but for him that's amazing - because he can't go and do that. ""It's quite sad as well, but he was just the nicest guy."" Kotecha says meeting the Man in the Mirror singer makes it hard for her to believe the rumours and accusations of child abuse that dogged him in life and in death. ""It does put a slant on these things,"" she says. ""You compare it to the person you knew, and I feel stronger in my convictions because of that."" Kotecha is speaking to the BBC after the broadcast of Leaving Neverland - a four-hour TV documentary which laid out the case against Jackson in gruelling, graphic detail last week on Channel 4 and HBO. It focuses on two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, both in their late 30s, who allege the star befriended them as children, then sexually abused them for years. The Jackson family has already fired back at the film, calling it a ""public lynching"" and the ""ultimate betrayal"" - and they're not the only ones to dispute the claims. Fans have congregated around the hashtags #MJInnocent and #MJFam, posting lengthy rebuttals to the documentary on YouTube, social media and specially-constructed websites. They've protested outside Channel 4's headquarters; and even bought adverts on London buses, carrying the slogan: ""Facts don't lie, people do"". Dan Reed, who directed Leaving Neverland, told the BBC that he and Jackson's accusers had also been targeted by Jackson's fans. ""There's been a lot of horrible things said about me online and we've received a lot of emails, too,"" he said a few days before the documentary was broadcast. ""I'm amazed that people feel entitled to do that when they haven't seen the film and don't know anything about me and they know even less about Michael Jackson."" On the last count, at least, he is wrong. The fans behind the campaign include lawyers and journalists, who are forensically acquainted with Michael Jackson and the allegations against him. ""We surface court statements, investigations, including from the FBI, and previous statements that clearly conflict with the accusations and information presented in the HBO documentary,"" says Tiffany, a US fan who posts under the name @RideTheBoogie. ""We felt very strongly we needed to be Michael's voice,"" says Kotecha, who, as an administrator of the MJInnocent.com website, helped organise the bus campaign. ""Because, ironically for someone whose entire career was based on his voice, he no longer has a voice."" The movement to clear Jackson's name has existed since he was first accused of molestation in 1993 (the case was later settled out of court for $23m), but it has become increasingly vocal since Leaving Neverland was announced in January. A main thread of their argument concerns the credibility of Robson and Safechuck, both of whom previously testified that Jackson never abused them. They now say they felt pressured into supporting the singer. Fans argue that Robson changed his story after being denied a role in a Jackson-themed Cirque Du Soleil production; and that he tried to sell a book detailing the abuse a year before he took his case to the courts. They also note that both Robson and Safechuck have been unsuccessful in their attempts to sue the Jackson estate - although both men's cases are now on appeal. 'Not one shred of evidence' ""If their allegations were to be true, this would be an atrocity,"" says Damien Shields, an Australian fan who has written a book on Jackson's music. ""These are very serious allegations of heinous crimes against innocent children. They [Robson and Safechuck] should be allowed to raise their voices and say what they want to say - but also, if you're going to do that, you need to be prepared to be scrutinised. ""And there is really nothing that is convincing when you look at the whole picture, to make you say, 'without doubt I believe these people'."" Fans are also aggrieved that Leaving Neverland offers no right of reply to Jackson or his family. Reed argues that the film features footage of Michael's denials but Shields says those clips are irrelevant. ""During his life, Wade Robson and James Safechuck supported Michael Jackson. So it baffles me that [Dan Reed] says he's included footage of Michael's denials, when the specific allegations he's made a four-hour film about, Michael never had a chance to reply to."" Going back further, fans highlight Jackson's acquittal on child abuse charges in 2005; and direct sceptics to unsealed FBI reports on the star, dating from 1993-4 and 2004-5, which found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. ""Not one shred of evidence,"" says Kotecha. ""You'd have to be some kind of super-human to be able to hide even the slightest thing from the FBI."" ""He was under a 10-year investigation by the FBI, he had two raids on his home, he was on a very public trial,"" agrees Matt Blank, a spokesperson for the Michael Jackson World Network fan club. ""All of this brought up no evidence of any abuse. So there's a part of you that has to say, 'With all of this scrutiny, why do we suddenly believe [these] two people... that have come forward and gone straight for the money pot?"" What about Jackson's own admission that he shared his bed with children? Doesn't that give him cause for concern? ""I come from a viewpoint [that] Michael lived a very different life than we could ever imagine,"" Blank told BBC Radio 5 live. ""And I think just as the world misunderstood him, he probably misunderstood the world as well, a little. ""There is a big difference between what we deem as odd behaviour [and] committing a crime. You shouldn't mix those two together, because that's a dangerous territory."" Despite his misgivings, Blank says Jackson's accusers ""come across as very convincing"" in Leaving Neverland. Kotecha also says she approached the documentary with an ""open mind"". ""I am interested in what they have to say,"" she says, ""because if they can challenge my beliefs, then I will look into it further."" And that's something that stands out: Jackson's fans are not, as Mr Shields puts it, ""loopy conspiracy theorists,"" but a group of people who've arrived at their position thoughtfully and sincerely, even if they find themselves on the wrong side of popular opinion. Mute Michael Jackson? Tiffany, who is herself a survivor of sexual abuse, stresses that her defence of Jackson is not mere idol worship. ""The fact that I was abused helps me better understand people who are innocently accused, as well as the minds of those on the dark side,"" she says. ""It's far easier for many to believe accusations about a man they don't understand or relate to. And, hey, it's more much more thrilling to read and spread gossip than dispel myths, isn't it? ""Missing from that equation is common sense and the review of justice system documents that contradict the accusations. ""As a victim of sexual abuse, I not only have a platform to motivate and inspire fellow victims, but I am compelled to fact-check the stories and credibility of potential victims."" Nonetheless, defending Jackson has been a tough and, at times, lonely task. ""It's exhausting and it affects me,"" says Shields. ""I can't speak for everybody, but it definitely is taking a toll."" And how does it change fans' relationship to Jackson's music? ""I have to be honest, it's damaging it,"" says Shields. ""It's putting a dampener on the pure bliss and joy and magic and escapism that artwork is supposed to provide us."" Tiffany disagrees. ""As fans, we're used to the cadence of negative stories. Each passing wave grounds me to what I truly believe in. ""While others suggest that we 'mute Michael Jackson', I'm instead compelled to turn MJ up. I'm going to play his music every chance I get, as loud as my speakers will handle. I'll continue to fight for what I believe is true. ""It is the least I can do for a man who means so much to me.""

"Georgina Chapman, 41, described Weinstein's actions as ""unforgivable"". Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow are the latest women to come forward. Both said the incidents happened early in their careers. On Tuesday, Weinstein also denied allegations of rape made in The New Yorker magazine. Weinstein was fired on Sunday from his own film studio. The Weinstein Company board said on Tuesday that they would help any criminal investigation. ""My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,"" Georgina Chapman, 41, told People magazine. Chapman and Weinstein, 65, have two children together. In a statement, the film mogul said: ""​I support her decision, I am in counselling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild."" Meanwhile, former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have joined the growing public condemnation. In a statement, they said they were ""disgusted by the recent reports about Harvey Weinstein"" and added that they ""celebrate the courage of women who have come forward"". Weinstein was a big donor to the Democratic party under Obama's leadership. The Obamas' eldest daughter Malia worked as an intern at The Weinstein Company in New York earlier this year. Weinstein also donated to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. Mrs Clinton said she was ""shocked and appalled"" by the revelations. Paltrow and Jolie both sent statements about Weinstein's behaviour to the New York Times, which first reported allegations against him last week. Jolie said in an email: ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did. ""This behaviour towards women in any field, any country is unacceptable."" In a statement, Paltrow alleged that, after Weinstein cast her in the leading role in Emma, he summoned her to his hotel suite, where he placed his hands on her and suggested massages in his bedroom. ""I was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,"" she told the newspaper. She said she told her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt about the incident, and said he confronted Weinstein. ""I thought he was going to fire me,"" she said. Others to have spoken out about their experiences with Weinstein include: The New Yorker report also said 16 former and current employees at Weinstein's companies ""witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances and touching at events associated with Weinstein's films and in the workplace"". Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement in response to the article. ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,"" she said. ""Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. ""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path."" Meanwhile, actress Lindsay Lohan posted an Instagram story - which she later deleted - appearing to defend Weinstein, saying: ""I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on."" Buzzfeed reporter Lauren Yap did a screen grab and posted Lohan's video, in which she also posted an angel emoji under Weinstein's name, on Twitter.

""A strong BBC"", he said, would ""bind the country together at home"" and be ""a British creative beacon to the world"". His speech came amid renewed calls for a change to the licence fee. In a report published last week, the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee said the TV licence is ""becoming harder... to justify"" and suggested every household could pay a new compulsory levy instead. ""We've always said that the licence fee should be updated to reflect changing times,"" Lord Hall went on in his speech. ""Adapting the licence fee for the internet age... is vital. ""I believe we need and we will need what the licence fee - in whatever form - makes happen more than ever.""

"Pagett was best known for playing Elizabeth Bellamy, the rebellious daughter of Richard and Lady Marjorie, in 1970s TV series Upstairs, Downstairs. Performances in Harold Pinter plays, notably 1985's Old Times, also defined her 30-year stage and screen career. Her daughter Eve Swannell confirmed she passed ""very peacefully"" on Wednesday. It followed a brain tumour diagnosis under three weeks ago, she told BBC News. ""It was extremely sudden"" she added. ""I was by her side"". Pagett's role as Bellamy in the first two series of ITV's 1971 drama Upstairs, Downstairs helped the show win four Emmys. Her character's storyline, dominated by a tumultuous love life while stuck in a loveless marriage, included conceiving a child through an affair with a publisher, before leaving for New York. It was Pagett's idea to exit the series because she said she ""didn't want to be known for one thing only."" She went on to play Elizabeth Fanschawe in the 1973 TV film Frankenstein: The True Story, and land the title role in BBC's 10-episode 1977 miniseries Anna Karenina. On the big screen, Pagett appeared in 1969's Anne of a Thousand Days, as well as 70s films There's a Girl in My Soup and Operation: Daybreak. Turns in Privates On Parade and Mike Newell's An Awfully Big Adventure followed, as well as starring alongside David Jason in 1989's comedy drama A Bit Of A Do. Theatre star Born in Cairo, Egypt in 1945 where her father Herbert Scott was an oil executive, Pagett had a nomadic childhood, before being sent to boarding school in the UK. Her passion for acting saw her accepted into London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art theatre school in 1962 - aged just 17 - where she changed her surname to Pagett upon graduating. After making her London debut at the Duchess Theatre in 1968's A Boston Story, a string of West End roles followed. These performances, as well as appearances in Jonathan Miller's 1974 season at Greenwich Theatre, eventually caught the eye of Harold Pinter and sparked a long working relationship. The playwright first directed Pagett at the National in 1983 as Helen, the provocative enchantress in The Trojan War Will Not Take Place. The pair reunited for 1985 revival of Old Times, in which she played the dreamy wife of Michael Gambon's film-maker alongside Liv Ullmann. However, her career was overshadowed by a long period of mental illness, including manic depression, which she wrote about in her book, Diamonds Behind My Eyes, published in 1997. She said at the time: ""We wrote the book in the hope that it might help other people. Manic depression is so common."" Pagett detailed how she became obsessed with a man she called ""The Stranger"" and began to send hundreds of love letters to him. It later emerged this was Tony Blair's press secretary Alastair Campbell, who she never met in person. Intermittent stays in psychiatric clinics followed. The actress was married to playwright Graham Swannell from 1975 until their divorce in 1997. She is survived by their daughter, Eve and her sister, Angela.

"The Hepworth Wakefield will be the largest purpose-built art gallery to open in the UK since the launch of Tate St Ives in Cornwall in 1993. It will feature 44 rarely-seen working models donated by Dame Barbara's family plus works by Henry Moore and Turner. Its 10 galleries will also host visiting exhibitions by artists including Eva Rothschild. Dame Barbara was born and grew up in the West Yorkshire city. She went to the Leeds School of Art with Moore. The pair, who remained lifelong friends, were pioneers of abstract sculpture in the UK. The artist became known for her pierced shapes, and her most famous works include Single Form, which is in the United Nations Plaza in New York, and Winged Figure, on the side of the John Lewis department store in London. She was made a Dame in 1965 and died in a fire at her studio in St Ives 10 years later at the age of 72. The gallery has been designed by architect David Chipperfield, and is expected to attract 150,000 visitors per year. Its director Simon Wallis said: ""The Hepworth Wakefield is a world class building designed by one of this country's leading architects, and is a fitting home for Wakefield's long-held ambition to be recognised as the birthplace of Barbara Hepworth. ""I believe that, when The Hepworth Wakefield opens in May, it will be seen as a visionary investment in the community and the cultural life of this country."" As well as Hepworth's 44 plaster and aluminium prototypes, the gallery will also include tools and materials from her studio, also donated by her descendants. Dame Barbara's granddaughter Dr Sophie Bowness said: ""We are very pleased to be making this gift through the Art Fund, to secure its future and ensure that it will be accessible to the public in perpetuity. ""The gift is a unique group of Barbara Hepworth's surviving prototypes, the majority in plaster, from which editions of bronzes were cast. It will greatly enhance our understanding of her working methods."" The Tate, the Arts Council and the British Council will loan works by other artists including works by Piet Mondrian, Constantin Brancusi and Alberto Giacometti to the gallery.",A £35m art gallery celebrating sculptor Dame Barbara Hepworth will open in Yorkshire on 21 May.
"The sequel made about £15m in the UK and Ireland and $127m (£98.9m) in the US and Canada, which are not counted towards the worldwide figures.

Disney say the sequel has set a new record for the biggest opening weekend for an animation. That's owing to the fact they consider this year's remake of The Lion King, which made $269m on its opening weekend, to be a live action film. Disney declined to enter the film in the category for best animated feature at next year's Oscars. But some feel the digital 3D film is more of a photo-realistic animation.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The new piece will be played by 323 musicians from the BBC's choirs and orchestras, all playing remotely due to restrictions necessitated by Covid-19. The lockdown means that most of this year's Proms season will comprise archive performances by some of the world's greatest classical musicians. But it is hoped that live performances will take place in the final two weeks. ""This year it is not going to be the Proms as we know them, but the Proms as we need them,"" said David Pickard, who organises the BBC's annual festival. ""We will provide a stimulating and enriching musical summer for both loyal Proms audiences and people discovering the riches we have to offer for the first time."" 'Musical washing machine' The grand opening is a new composition by Iain Farrington, which celebrates the 250th anniversary of Beethoven's birth. Titled Beethoveniana, it features all five BBC orchestras and the BBC singers, all recorded in lockdown. Farrington has described it as ""taking Beethoven's music and putting it in a musical washing machine to see which colours run"". The piece even includes a nod to Saturday Night Fever, which included a disco version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony on its 1977 soundtrack. ""It's something I've enjoyed writing hugely,"" said Farrington, ""and I think it's something that hopefully captures a lot of the celebratory spirit of the Proms"". The performance will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3 at 19:00 BST. A specially filmed video, featuring two dancers interpreting the music, will be shown on BBC Four on Sunday. The rest of the first night will delve into the Proms archive, with Igor Levit's performance of Beethoven's dramatic Piano Concerto No. 3, originally played at the 2017 First Night; and Sir Harrison Birtwistle's ""fiendishly difficult"" saxophone concerto, Panic, which premiered at the Last Night of the 100th-anniversary Proms season in 1995. The programme will finish with a repeat of the great Italian conductor Claudio Abbado's final Proms appearance, in 2007, leading the Lucerne Festival Orchestra in a rapturous performance of Mahler's Third Symphony. Listeners are being encouraged to take part on Twitter, using the hashtag #PromsListeningParty, where BBC Radio 3 will be sharing programme notes, archive photos and behind-the-scenes stories on the performances. The archive will continue to be raided for the next six weeks, with highlights including Leonard Bernstein leading the Vienna Philharmonic through Mahler's Fifth Symphony (26 August); the unforgettable debut of the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela under Gustavo Dudamel (23 August); and Radio 1's Ibiza Prom, which gave a raft of club classics a fresh lease of life (31 July). Then, for the final two weeks, starting on 28 August, live music will return to the Royal Albert Hall with 14 concerts featuring mostly British musicians, including pianist Stephen Hough, violinist Nicola Benedetti and cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason. The season will culminate in a pared-back version of the traditional Last Night, with soprano Golda Schultz joining conductor Dalia Stasevska and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Details of the live concerts, which are likely to take place without an audience, are still being decided, as organisers observe the constantly-changing social-distancing guidelines for orchestral musicians. ""The advice on how many players we can have has all been - to put it mildly - slightly unclear,"" said conductor Sakari Oramo, who told the BBC he was planning ""four different options"" for the first night. ""There won't be a Proms atmosphere in the same way,"" he added. ""But, of course, once the music gets going, the music will take us where it needs to take us.""

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The song has now been played 7.04 billion times, overtaking the previous record holder Despacito, the Latin pop smash by singer Luis Fonsi. Played back-to-back, that would mean Baby Shark has been streamed continuously for 30,187 years. Pinkfong stands to have made about $5.2m (£4m) from YouTube streams alone. It took four years for Baby Shark to ascend to the top of YouTube's most-played chart, but the song is actually much older than that. It is thought to have originated in US summer camps in the 1970s. One theory says it was invented in 1975, as Steven Spielberg's Jaws became an box office smash around the world. There are a huge number of variations on the basic premise, including one version where a surfer loses an arm to the shark, and another where the protagonist dies. There are also international versions - including the French Bebe Requin and the German Kleiner Hai (Little Shark), which became a minor hit in Europe in 2007. But none of them could match the phenomenal success of Pinkfong's interpretation, which was sung by 10-year-old Korean-American singer Hope Segoine and uploaded to YouTube in 2015. It's addictive ""doo doo doo doo doo doo"" hook and fishy dance moves became a craze in South Korea, where popular bands like Red Velvet, Girls' Generation and Blackpink started incorporating it into their concerts. The following June, Pinkfong put out a second video, titled Baby Shark Dance, featuring two cute kids performing the dance routine. That clip that inspired the hashtag #BabySharkChallenge - with everyone from Indonesian farmworkers to pop stars Cardi B and Josh Groban joining the fun. The song is catnip for children, whose appetite for repetition has undoubtedly helped it climb the ranks of YouTube's most-watched videos. ""Nursery rhymes have always been sort of slow, very cute, but something that would help your children fall asleep - as opposed to Baby Shark,"" Pinkfong's marketing director Jamie Oh told the BBC in 2018. ""Pinkfong's Baby Shark is very trendy and it has a very bright beat with fun dance moves. The animation is very vivid. We call it K-Pop for the next generation."" The company is turning the song into a movie and a musical, and aspires to make Baby Shark ""another classic for kids music, like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", Oh added. Prison torture claim However, Pinkfong's parent company SmartStudy was sued last year by children's songwriter Jonathan Wright, who recorded a similar arrangement of the song in 2011 and argues that he owns the copyright to that interpretation. SmartStudy responded that their verison was ""based on a traditional sing-along chant which has passed to public domain"". The case is still under consideration by the Korea Copyright Commission. Last month, the song was at the centre of another controversy, when three prison workers in Oklahoma were accused of using it to punish inmates. According to court documents, five prisoners were handcuffed against a wall and forced to stand for two hours while listening to Baby Shark on repeat. Exposure to the song put ""undue emotional stress on the inmates who were most likely already suffering"", said district attorney David Prater. But the song has also been put to positive use. When Eliane Jabbour unexpectedly found herself in the middle of an anti-government demonstration in Lebanon last October, she was concerned the commotion would scare her 15-month-old son, who had just woken from a nap in the passenger seat of her car. Instead, the protestors circled her car and sang Baby Shark to help calm the toddler down. A video of the episode in Beirut - with Robin staring wide-eyed at the singing and dancing - itself went viral, and became a symbol of hope amid the protests.

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter The London-based artist was appalled. As someone who had endured the life-threatening brutality of back-street abortions she was dismayed the Portuguese - particularly the women - had passed up the chance to legalise the termination of pregnancies on request up to 10 weeks from conception. The wholly avoidable deaths and distress suffered by thousands of women resorting to illegal abortions every year would continue. No wonder her father had said Portugal was no place for a woman, before packing off his talented teenage daughter to England to hone her painterly skills at The Slade School of Fine Art in London. She sat in her Camden Town studio and fumed, determined to do something about the situation; to change public opinion back home; to make a difference. Which she did (the law was changed in 2007). By doing what she always did when overwhelmed with anger. She created a group of troubling, ominous images. Rego's abortion pictures are as confrontational and direct as a John Humphrys interview. There's no flim-flam, no tip-toeing around the topic: she gets straight to the point… which is darkly ambiguous. She is both explicit and vague. There is an equivocation that makes for uncomfortable viewing. Her truth resides in psychological complexity however awkward it may be. To Rego, the grim reality of a back-street abortion is not intellectually straightforward. It is not simply a case of a bad thing happening. Look at any of the imposingly large pictures she made in this series and you will be disturbed. There is an uneasy eroticism bound up in the pain and the squalor. The schoolgirls and young women depicted challenge the unseen figure with a physicality and preparedness. Have they girded up their loins in anticipation of an impending termination or something else? Welcome to Paula Rego World, where there is always something nasty in the woodshed. To see a Rego picture is to be thrust into the midst of a sinister gothic drama. A fat-ankled lady wearing a walnut-like skirt bends down to lift a prone dog by its front legs in Snare (1987). She leans forward as if to give the animal a sensual kiss, a red rose in the foreground suggests love. Near it, a crab lies powerless on its back mirroring the dog's vulnerability. It is rich with symbolism and menace. It is also technically very good. The red-to-brown palette has the tonal harmony of Picasso's impeccable portrait of Gertrude Stein (1905-6). The suggested volume of the figures is as convincing as a mirage in the desert. And the weight the lady's legs bear, and pressure of the grip with which she holds the dog, are palpable. It is a very good figurative painting. It marks the moment Rego found her signature style. There had always been a strong narrative element to her work, whether back in the 1960s when she was making cut-up collages like The Imposter (1964) critiquing the Estado novo authoritarian regime in Portugal. Or, in the early '80s with abstracted, cartoon-like paintings such as Red Monkey Offers Bear A Poisoned Dove (1981), lampooning the love triangle she constructed between her husband and her paramour. But these were works in progress towards the stylised tableaus and heavy-featured figures that are now instantly recognisable as a Paula Rego. Hers is an idiosyncratic aesthetic heightened later by the use of oil pastel crayons instead of acrylic paint, a mid-career decision made - I am told - in part to help her stop smoking. The results are impressive. Turn 180 degrees from the Abortion Series hanging in the central space of the MK Gallery, and there, on the opposite wall, are her Dog Women pictures from the early 1990s. They were inspired by the French Impressionist painter, Edgar Degas. He was an artist famous for his use of pastels and elevated perspective, from which he portrayed dainty dancers in ballet rehearsals. His representations of a woman's physique and inner life were voyeuristic, with a hint of the dirty-old-man about them. Rego's couldn't be more different. Her Dog Women are more like werewolves; snarling creatures that are both loyal and fiercely independent. The pictures are a response to the death of her husband, the artist Victor (Vic) Willing whom she met while a student at The Slade. She considered Vic her intellectual and artistic superior, a point of view he was in no rush to counter. His critical eye helped her work develop but petrified his own. Life got complicated. He was already married. She went back to Portugal. Vic left his wife and went to live with Paula. He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. They both had affairs. Her father died. Vic took over the family business and ran it into the ground. They returned to London, penniless. Paula found a lover to help pay the way. Vic began to paint again shortly before he died. Theirs was a passionate, painful, profound relationship, which Rego renders in pastel with disarming sincerity. Woman becomes dog-like, part domesticated and part wild animal. She lies on her owner's jacket in Sleeper (1994), is kicked out of bed in Bad Dog (1994), and roars in rage in Dog Woman (1994). But it is in Sit (1994) that Rego captures the specific and the universal of her marriage to Vic with an emotional intensity you won't quickly forget. The female figure is doing as she has been told, sitting obediently in her chair. Her hands are behind her back, possibly bound. Her feet are crossed in the manner of the crucified Christ. She is pregnant. She looks up and away at her tormentor, her owner, her lover. She is trapped, subjugated, but in no way tamed. Her eyes blaze with defiance, her body emits power. There is an air of sexuality and violence, love and hate; beauty and the grotesque. It is a uniquely good picture. It's not the best image ever created. It is not even the best image Paula Rego has ever created - The Dance (not in this exhibition) - is better. But it is exceptional. We've seen plenty of male artists picturing woman in myriad different ways, but who else has painted the world from a female point of view in the manner described by Paula Rego? Louise Bourgeois and Frida Kahlo had similar concerns, and expressed them just as unflinchingly, But Rego's voice is more literary, painterly and poetic in the way of Edgar Allan Poe. She references the Brontë sisters, Edvard Munch, William Hogarth and Francisco Goya. She is a romantic surrealist with a satirist's cutting edge. Quite why she is not more famous is difficult to fathom. Maybe her gender and style went against her? A bit too much for all those buttoned-up male museum directors whose stripped back modernist tastes ruled the roost for far too long. Their time has come and gone. The game is changing. I can't recall another exhibition season quite like this summer's, when there are so many monographic shows dedicated to female artists being staged across the country. It brings to mind the female figure in Sit. She knew her time would come. And so it has. It is now. Recent reviews by Will Gompertz Follow Will Gompertz on Twitter","It is June 1998 and Paula Rego is furious. Her people, the Portuguese people, had not turned up in sufficient numbers to vote in the recently held national referendum to change the country's conservative abortion law."
"By Anna BaileyReporter, BBC Radio 4's You and Yours The report, from the UK charity Attitude is Everything, reveals that 82% of deaf and disabled music lovers questioned had difficulties booking tickets to live music events, while more than 73% felt discriminated against. It also found that one in 10 had considered legal action. The main gripes included premium rate booking lines, the lack of accessible tickets and online booking systems. When tickets for Ed Sheeran's Divide tour went on sale last year, many disabled fans complained they couldn't reach the accessible booking line as it had been taken over by fans trying to obtain general tickets. Jacob Adams, research and campaigns manager for Attitude is Everything, said: ""Ticketing is still one of the biggest issues we get contacted about by live music fans. ""This is particularly the case when it comes to one-off gigs outdoors and in larger arenas where there are often multiple companies selling tickets. It's a complicated picture."" According to government statistics, 3.3 million disabled people went to a live music event in the past year and disabled music fans make up 11% of the live music audience. Attitude is Everything believes that the industry could be potentially missing out on millions of pounds due to poor ticketing systems. Seventy-nine percent of survey respondents said they had been put off buying tickets due to problems booking access. Michael Dugher, CEO of UK Music, feels that more needs to be done. ""What we need is more comprehensive action,"" he says. ""You can make a venue or festival as accessible as you like, but if buying a ticket becomes an insurmountable barrier to disabled customers, then event organisers will risk falling short at the first hurdle."" He added: ""Britain is the best place in the world for live music. No one should ever be denied the right to experience a live music event."" The Access to Music report follows a survey carried out by Attitude is Everything in 2014 which revealed 95% of deaf and disabled music fans faced ticketing barriers. While improvements have been made, mystery shoppers have complained of poorly trained booking staff and a lack of accessible pre-sale and VIP tickets, as well as artist meet-ups. Along with 38 venues and ticketing companies, the charity is launching a new government-backed coalition, Ticketing Without Barriers, at the Roundhouse in London to help tackle these issues. Recommendations include the use of access cards and a universal system to help identify fans' needs. ""Everybody in the industry now needs to take responsibility including artists,"" says Jacob Adams. ""There's lots of competition across the live music market. but access shouldn't be one of those things."" Ruth's Story Ruth Patterson is a music lover and the lead singer of Holy Moly and The Crackers. ""When I was 15 years old I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and at 21 with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is a hypermobility disorder that means my joints dislocate easily and I have to use a wheelchair outside of the house. ""While I've had some good experiences of buying tickets for gigs, I've also had some pretty bad ones as artists and venues tend to use different ticketing systems. ""At Newcastle City Hall and at the O2 Academy in Newcastle, I had to get a doctor's note to prove my disability. And for City Hall it had to be within a certain time-frame or else it would have been invalid. ""While I'm not against proving my disability, I resent the amount of time this takes, particularly when you're promised access and when you get to the gig the venue clearly isn't accessible. ""This happened when I went to see The 1975 at the O2. I had to speak to various different people to purchase a priority ticket, but when I got to the venue I was told I'd have to queue outside even though it was cold and pouring with rain. ""Once inside, we found the bar inaccessible and the staff were not willing to help us buy drinks. There were also drunk people standing in front of us so we couldn't see the band performing on stage. I personally resent paying £45 a ticket for this. ""I find that booking staff can often be a bit clueless or patronising when it comes to my needs. It's embarrassing when they ask lots of personal questions, like 'do you need help getting to the toilet?' ""Sometimes it's like they're almost doing you a favour, letting you see a band, particularly the ones that sell out quickly.

But the items have been returned to a Memphis funeral operator who says there is no way to prove they are authentic. They were said to have been saved by an unnamed, retired embalmer for 30 years.

"By Neil SmithArts reporter, BBC News What happens after happily ever after, ponder Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine in Into the Woods, a mischievous musical mash-up of such beloved classic fairy tales as Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstalk. Almost three decades on from their show's acclaimed and award-winning Broadway debut, we now have an answer to that question - it gets turned into a movie. With a stellar cast headed by Meryl Streep, Johnny Depp and Star Trek's Chris Pine, Rob Marshall's adaptation tells of a childless couple, played by Britain's James Corden and Emily Blunt, who set out to reverse a cruel spell by gathering items from Cinders, Little Red and their ilk. Their quest demands repeated forays into the titular woods, a shifting and uncertain place where death and disaster are as easily stumbled upon as magic and romance. Marshall, whose previous musicals include the Oscar-winning Chicago and the rather less feted Nine, describes Into the Woods as Sondheim's ""most heartfelt piece"". Yet it is one that has taken a while to reach the screen - a consequence of both the challenges posed by the material and the fluctuating fortunes of the movie musical itself. ""There were attempts to do it in the 1990s,"" the director explains, making reference to an abortive adaptation that would have featured Billy Crystal, Meg Ryan and a supporting cast made up of Jim Henson's Muppets. ""But it's nice to have it happen now, and I was very lucky to have Stephen and James with me as we were making those tough decisions about how to translate it onto film."" 'Incredibly challenging' For Anna Kendrick, Oscar-nominated star of Pitch Perfect, Up in the Air and the Twilight series, the decision to accept the role of Cinderella was anything but tough. ""The idea of taking tales that have been part of our culture for centuries and turning them on their heads is such an interesting thing to explore,"" says Kendrick. What was tough was the effort the actress had to put in to do justice to Sondheim's demanding score and lyrics. ""The music kicked my ass,"" says Kendrick. ""It is incredibly challenging, but that's because he doesn't write it for it to feel nice or sound nice or relax the audience into a sweeping melody. ""He never wants the audience to sit back in their chairs, or the performer to be falling asleep at the wheel,"" she says of the 84-year-old composer, whose other works include Assassins, Sweeney Todd and A Little Night Music. ""It's like having the world's best tennis partner. It's exhausting and it challenges you, but it forces you to do their best work."" ""I'm a huge Sondheim fan,"" says fellow cast member James Corden. ""He's the finest lyricist alive, and possibly the best lyricist musical theatre has ever had. 'Man on the street' ""There are some musicals where you could take out a song from one show and replace it with one from another. But that's not the case with Sondheim, because there is never a song for song's sake."" Corden's humble Baker is an everyman figure whose determination to become a father sees him interact with a witch, played by Streep, and other members of the film's fantastical ensemble. ""The Baker and his wife are the only characters who have never existed before in other stories,"" says the Gavin and Stacey star, who will relocate to the US later this year to host a late night talk show on the CBS network. ""He is the eyes and the ears of the audience and he's representing the man on the street. Sometimes what you want to do is a big number, but he's not that guy and that's not his role in the story."" Corden, who had planned to appear in a Broadway revival of Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum before CBS came calling, may be playing the straight man on screen but off camera the British actor admits he was prone to playing the occasional prank on his unsuspecting co-stars. ""I started a rumour where I managed to convince Anna that Meryl had been fired,"" Corden confesses. ""It lasted a good 25 minutes until Meryl arrived on set in full make-up. ""I was particularly proud of that. I thought at the time, 'This might be the greatest thing I've ever done.'"" Into the Woods is out in the UK and Ireland on 9 January.","Fairy tale characters come to life in Into the Woods, a film version of Stephen Sondheim's popular Tony-winning musical.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter The main mystery in any TV drama about a murder - or murders - is usually whodunit. If not, it's howdunit. Those two questions are cleared up early in the first episode of ITV's Des, which takes its title from the nickname for Dennis Nilsen, who killed at least 15 young men in the late 1970s and early '80s. Nilsen, as portrayed by David Tennant, is apparently very co-operative when asked to help the police with their enquiries after human bones are found blocking his drains. So the question that's left is whydunit. Nilsen was 37 when he was arrested at his north London home in 1983. At the time, he was working in a Job Centre, following stints in the police and the Army catering corps. ""Of the few people I met who had personally known him, one of the most frequent descriptions seems to be that he was actually rather boring,"" Tennant says. ""It certainly would seem that those who worked with him at the job office found him pleasant enough. Sometimes he would drone on a little, but there was certainly nothing extraordinary, apparently, about this man. ""So you're trying to make sense of who that human being is to the outside world, and link it up to this extraordinary private life at home, which had bodies rotting under his floorboards, and which was about luring people back to his flat, where he seemed to have no compunction about taking the life of a young man who just came home for a bit of supper and a chat."" Many of Nilsen's victims were homeless and vulnerable. Nilsen himself tried to explain the roots of his ""destructive binges"" in letters to police that were read at his trial. ""It would be better if my reason for killing could be clearly defined, ie robbery, jealousy, hate, revenge, sex, blood lust or sadism,"" he wrote. ""But it is none of these."" At his trial, prosecutors described him as a cunning and resourceful murderer who had killed for pleasure. Tennant gives a remarkable performance as an apparently unremarkable man who - superficially - doesn't fit the ""evil monster"" tabloid mould. As author Brian Masters, played by Jason Watkins, puts it at one point in the programme: ""That's what makes the whole thing so intriguing - this dichotomy between this seemingly normal, unobtrusive civil servant and the nature of his crimes."" For research, Tennant studied footage and books, as well as speaking to people who knew the killer. Luke Neal's script ""presented this character who will remain forever unknowable, I suspect"", the actor says. ""Then you try and sort of join the dots as best you can and present something that will look like a truth. Without pretending to understand everything about who Nilsen was and why he did what he did, you hopefully can assemble something that will illuminate the unilluminatable."" While that sounds like a tall order, Tennant gives a convincingly deadpan portrayal. It's proof, if it were needed, of the former Doctor Who star's range. He recently won lockdown with two comic appearances - in Staged, the brilliant long-distance double act with Michael Sheen, and a TikTok-inspired reunion with Catherine Tate for the BBC's Big Night In. Des also features superb performances from Watkins as Nilsen's biographer, and Daniel Mays as dogged Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay. ""There's always the added pressure when you're playing a real person, particularly in a story like this,"" Mays says. ""You want to do the story justice."" Watkins also knows about playing real-life characters, including Prime Minister Harold Wilson in The Crown and the Bafta-winning title role in The Lost Honour of Christopher Jefferies. Des, he says, is intended to be ""a huge acknowledgement of the victims and their families' pain"". Although about 40 years have passed since the murders, the pain will be largely undimmed for the relatives. The brother of one victim has complained that the drama is ""trying to glorify a murderer"". Tennant says producers spoke to the families of Nilsen's victims to make them aware of the programme and the intentions behind it. Pain 'still raw' ""It's something that everyone was always very keenly aware of,"" he says. ""This is recent history, this is all within our lifetimes that this happened, and therefore a lot of the legacy of pain that Nilsen caused is still pretty raw."" The programme has been made ""in no way to celebrate the macabre, but to memorialise the victims as much as anything"", the actor insists. ""That's one of the reasons for telling this story. Of course, when you do a story like this, everyone involved is very aware that you have to tread carefully and that you must be sensitive to the variety of reactions that it will provoke."" Nilsen, from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, died in jail in 2018. Tennant says they were ""quite keen to make sure we didn't buy into"" his own notion of notoriety. That's a fine line to tread in a high-profile prime-time mini-series with him at its centre. ""I think Dennis Nilsen himself became rather obsessed with his legacy after he was caught,"" the star says. ""Anyone who had known him at all, it seemed, said he was at best unremarkable and at worst bloody boring to be around. And yet, If you read his own writings about himself, the self-aggrandisement and the narcissism is breathtaking. ""Clearly, one of the extraordinary things about this story is that he killed so many people without anybody apparently noticing, and that nobody in his life raised an alarm, and it could go on for the number of years that it did. ""That's one of the things that I think a drama like this can help us all unpick. How does a human being like this come to be, and how do they travel undetected for as long as he did?"" Des is on ITV in three parts from Monday 14 to Wednesday 16 September.","Dennis Nilsen was one of Britain's most notorious serial killers. David Tennant explains why he played him in a new TV drama as ""boring""."
"Pretty Woman: The Musical stars Isle of Man actress Samantha Barks as Vivian Ward, the role that catapulted Julia Roberts to stardom in the 1990 film. Reviews have been mixed, with The Guardian giving it one star and calling it ""a tasteless disaster"". However, The Telegraph gave it four stars and praised the chemistry between Barks and her co-star Andy Karl. Karl plays the high-powered Edward Lewis, filling the shoes of Richard Gere. ""They make a terrifically entertaining and magnetic pair,"" the Telegraph's critic Diane Snyder wrote. ""Barks is sparkling and spunky, a winning foil for Karl (a recent Olivier winner for the musical of Groundhog Day), who finds a rich emotional undercurrent in the uncompromising businessman."" The film, about the relationship between a millionaire and a prostitute in Hollywood, has been ranked as the highest-grossing romantic comedy of all time. The Stage also gave the new musical adaptation a four-star review. ""Jerry Mitchell's peppy production is propelled by the sheer professionalism of its delivery, the attractive soft-rock songs of Bryan Adams and Jim Vallance, and the chemistry of its leads,"" Mark Shenton wrote. Shenton also hailed the scene-stealing ""fierce, belting voice"" of actress Orfeh, who plays Vivian's best friend Kit. However, The Guardian's Alexis Soloski called the musical ""tuneful, schlocky, and deeply offensive"". She wrote: ""You might have thought that a musical adaptation, even one created by an all-male creative team, would have nodded to a few cultural changes or at least given its female lead a credible storyline. ""You might have thought wrong."" The show is ""still the heart-warming story of how sex teaches a man to feel and money teaches a woman to… shop?"" Soloski wrote. ""But now it has a middle-aged male narrator (Eric Anderson) added on."" Time Out's reviewer Adam Feldman said the musical was ""just a dutiful replica of the movie"", with ""nearly every well-known line in roughly the same order"". He added: ""Even Roberts's signature costumes are copied, and sometimes presented for entrance applause."" He added: ""Not only does this approach miss an opportunity to rethink the story's sugar-daddy fantasy in a deeper way, it also gets stale fast; this ain't our first time on Rodeo Drive.""

"By Sarah Jane GriffithsEntertainment reporter Apple has now revealed what DJ Zane Lowe left BBC Radio 1 to do - he will be one of three launch presenters on the station broadcasting from Los Angeles. Joining him on the roster are Ebro Darden broadcasting from New York and Rinse FM's Julie Adenuga from London. Industry insiders have spoken to the BBC to give their thoughts on the new kid on the radio block. Ben Cooper - controller, BBC Radio 1 Beats 1 is a global radio station and it has said it will launch with three very specialist music programmes - a hip hop DJ from New York, a grime DJ from London and Zane - that's a very specialist offering at the moment. I'm not scared of what they've got, I'm very intrigued by it and it would be a fool that ignores them, because they're something like a $109bn company, so of course you're going to look at what they're doing. ""A rising tide lifts all boats"" is the expression, and I think it's good for the radio industry that a tech company so used to changing the way we operate as human beings - with iPads and smart phones - wants to do radio. Having a presenter tell you ""this is the next big tune that you need in your life"" is so much more engaging and exciting than a streaming device. Hopefully the UK radio industry can work with Apple. They've got a 24/7 global radio station and at the moment they've only announced three presenters. There's a lot of content they'll need to fill those hours, and who makes the best music radio content in the world? The BBC - so I'm looking forward to that call from Zane soon. Roy Martin - managing editor, Radio Today Beats 1 isn't about radio, it's about music. Most radio stations offer local news, travel, information and entertainment so Apple's new single radio station won't have much of an impact on most of them. People who listen to local radio generally don't listen for the music. However, specialist music stations such as 1Xtra, Kiss, 6 Music (and to an extent, Capital and Radio 1) will be more at risk than the likes of Radio Plymouth, The Bee and Clyde 1. Apple is targeting new music lovers and fans. I'm not sure we can categorise the intended audience by age or gender, but they will generally be the younger end of the market. Apple will put lots of marketing behind Beats 1 and pay large amounts to attract star guest presenters, which will be good news for radio in general. There are thousands of services already but it takes a company the size of Apple for it to be noticed and used widely. Jeff Smith - head of music, BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music The great American radio programmer Rick Sklar of '60s New York superstation WABC invented the concept of Top 40 radio - playing listeners' favourite songs and future hits which his team had picked and playing them on heavy rotation. This gave birth to UK music pirate radio and eventually Radio 1. Sklar said that great music radio is ""where art meets science"" - I've always believed this to be true and Apple Music is to my mind one manifestation of this theory. Apple Music is by it own admission a music service for music people and I'd contend great music stations like BBC Radio 6 Music, Australia's Triple J and LA's KCRW already do this. So why are they bothering? I think it's a case of creating another gateway into the Apple walled garden and a proposed free-to-the-listener radio service makes a lot of sense in the US where they face opposition such as XM Sirius and Pandora. This gateway will also allow the massive Apple iTunes inbuilt consumer base to give a leg up to the still niche streaming music industry. Whilst competing with the likes of Spotify it could also be a fillip to them. My question is what about the mainstream, regular people who just like music but don't need a reason or credibility for every song they hear? This lack of appeal to mainstream listeners is I think the reason I found Apple Music - as it stands - a bit underwhelming; it's a version of Spotify with its music streaming service, a bit of BBC Introducing with Connect and a bit of 6 Music with Beats 1. So perhaps Beats 2 will be more like Radio 2 and target a mainstream music audience? The impact on UK music radio will be to make us all better at our jobs - we'll have to rely even more on our own ears, tear up the research, ditch the music consultants and let great music programmers come to the fore again. Fraser McAlpine - music writer There was a lot of hot talk last night about Beats 1 being an ecosystem for music, which implies it is not going to be part of a bigger, pre-existing ecosystem. It also suggests discrete services which always made sense in their own environments - audio streaming, music video, social media and so on - will be brought together in one place, Jurassic Park-style. That kind of flannel is troubling, because if Apple were truly revolutionising the way everyone accesses and experiences music, they would not need to talk it up in those terms. The innovation and therefore the value to consumers would be palpable. Certainly curated content is great, and that is why there are radio stations, but radio stations build up trust with their listeners over a long time, and the relationship feels personal, and often local. That's not to say Apple can't develop that trust - it's just going to take a while (and a few more additions to the ecosystem) before the true value becomes apparent. Matt Deegan - creative director of radio and new media consultancy, Folder Media Apple is launching a radio station as it's the best way to market Apple Music - its new subscription streaming product. If consumers have access to all the world's music at their fingertips, they'll need a guide: Someone to suggest things to listen to. Apple's answer is providing a linear radio station, some automated channels, playlists and a new social media platform for artists. Their linear radio station - Beats 1 - will be about new music using famous DJs like Zane Lowe. They'll do a good job at this with a hefty content and marketing budget, but with limited distribution (online only) and a ""new music"" format it's unlikely to be a devastating challenge to existing UK radio stations. The big question is whether this is just the beginning of their content ambitions and whether we'll see them launch more linear, presenter-led radio stations. Could Ken Bruce take Popmaster worldwide? If they did, it definitely would be a worry, but I think this is unlikely. Beats 1 and Apple Music isn't about taking on radio - it's about providing an environment to encourage people to pay a tenner a month to subscribe to Apple Music. Spotify has much more to worry about than Capital FM.","The radio industry has given a mixed reaction to the launch of Apple Music's new radio station Beats 1, which was announced on Monday,"
