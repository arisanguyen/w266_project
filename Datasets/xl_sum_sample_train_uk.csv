"Emily Koch suffered two broken legs and ligament damage in the collision in London. But despite her initial anger at the man responsible, she says the accident led to her pursuing her dream to become a writer. Her first novel won a major award and her second will be released in March. Ms Koch says her career as an author began when she stepped on to a pedestrian crossing in Mile End, east London, in 2008. With the lights flashing amber it should have been safe for her to cross but she was hit by a car, breaking her legs and leading to months of physio and rehabilitation before she could walk again. Ms Koch is about to release her second novel Keep Him Close after her debut book If I Die Before I Wake was named one of Waterstones paperbacks of the year for 2019. Both are set in Bristol, where she lives. Keep Him Close tells the story of a woman who befriends the mother of her son's killer. Horfield Prison, which Ms Koch says she passes every day, is at the centre of the plot. 'Life is short' ""The accident galvanised me to write,"" said Ms Koch, 34. ""It made me realise that life is too short not to do the things that you love. ""The writing came several years afterwards but if I hadn't had that accident there's a good chance I'd still be sitting at my desk in an office thinking 'oh, one day I'll have that great idea and write a book'."" Despite her philosophical outlook now, at the time Ms Koch, originally from Cheltenham, says she was furious with the driver, who was spoken to by the police but not prosecuted. He was sent on a driver improvement course and paid Ms Koch compensation. ""Having to be wheeled to the toilet by your father at the age of 22 or being unable to sleep due to the pain and discomfort of wearing leg braces - it was tough and for a long time, I found it really hard to cross roads,"" she said. ""There were moments in the early days of my recovery when I did get angry and shouted at him [the driver]. Even though he wasn't there, I directed my frustrations at him. ""But I've managed to let that anger go. I think if I met him now I think I would say thank you. ""But I'd also tell him to drive more carefully.""",A woman left seriously injured after being hit by a car says she would thank the driver if they met now.
"Lucy Edwards, who became Radio 1's first blind presenter last year, has been a hit on the app since launching her channel last month. A video demonstrating how blind people light a candle amassed 7.5m views while another about crossing a road notched up more than two million. The 24-year-old, from Sutton Coldfield, said she welcomed questions. Freelance journalist Ms Edwards has Incontinentia Pigmenti, which affected her sight as a child. She lost sight in her right eye at the age of 11, and in her left eye at 17. 'Can blind people work?' Being asked how blind people perform certain everyday tasks inspired her to start making videos. ""At the start it overwhelmed me how many people asked me things like 'how do you go to the toilet or how do you know what room you're in?' she said. ""But I'd rather they ask me and know I'm competent and capable."" Ms Edwards said the most Googled question about blindness was ""can a blind person work?"". ""It's mundane for me, I've known how to do things for seven years, but for everyone else, it dispels myths about blindness. ""They're [people] just genuinely curious, I'm just happy they're intrigued about my life, it's a privilege to be able to teach people."" Despite this, she said the ""crazy"" reaction to her candle video had surprised her but she was pleased people were interested.

"The vehicles were used on 12 routes over the past decade but Mayor Boris Johnson called them ""cumbersome machines"" which were too big for narrow streets and encouraged fare-dodgers. He has ordered nearly 500 new buses to replace them and promised more vehicles on the routes during the rush hour. But campaigners said they were ""the most accessible bus in London"" and would be missed by wheelchair users. The final route to be operated with bendy buses has been the 207 between Hayes and White City, and the last of the long vehicles was to run late on Friday. Transport for London (TfL) predicted it would increase its takings by Â£7.4m because fare-evasion would now become harder. The ""hop-on, hop-off"" style of the bendy buses, with few checks on tickets, had encouraged thousands of people to avoid paying. 'Frequently stranded' But Transport for All, which speaks for older and disabled transport users, said TfL was ""nuts"" to scrap the vehicles, especially as their new Routemaster-style replacements had only ""a tiny wheelchair space"". ""On every other bus in London, wheelchair users are frequently left stranded at the bus stop when pushchair users refuse to fold their buggy and give up the wheelchair bay,"" said spokeswoman Lianna Etkind. ""Many wheelchair users simply won't travel at the time of the school run, because conflict with pushchair users who won't move is so common."" The Liberal Democrats said while 120 passengers could board a bendy bus, a double-decker could hold only 85. ""As the replacement buses to the bendy buses are often just maintaining the same frequency, the reality is significant less capacity on numerous bus routes across London,"" said London Assembly member Caroline Pidgeon. And Labour member Val Shawcross said ""a considerable amount of TfL's time, effort and money had been spent replacing these buses, which covered just 12 out of 700 bus routes in London"".",The last of London's bendy buses was taken off the roads on Friday night.
"Four members of Friends of Horsey Seals netted the seal, which is about four years old, on a Norfolk beach. David Vyse, vice-chairman of the group, said: ""It had been sleeping on the beach, but got very feisty once we got it in the net."" After about 30 minutes the team managed to remove a rubber ring from its neck and then release it back into the sea. ""The operation can be pretty dangerous because they have a vicious bite,"" he said. Mr Vyse said the team, which monitors the seal colony at Horsey between Great Yarmouth and Cromer, had checked to see if it was injured and had it been it would have been taken to the RSPCA wildlife hospital at East Winch, in west Norfolk. He said there were about six or so seals they know of which have either fishing wire or frisbee-type flying rings stuck around their necks. ""Normally we can't catch them because they are too close to the water,"" he said. He urged people to be more aware of plastics and the danger they pose to wildlife. ""People should be more careful and respectful,"" said Mr Vyse. He said the rubber ring was removed at about 13:00 BST on Saturday. The East Winch animal hospital, near King's Lynn, has treated at least 50 seals with injuries caused by discarded man-made rubbish since 2008, the RSPCA said.

Vine, 47, saw his joke scoop almost a fifth of the votes in the competition run by comedy television channel, Dave. It is the first time the award has been presented to a previous winner. Vine also won in 2010 with the joke: ""I've just been on a once-in-a-lifetime holiday. I'll tell you what, never again."" He was runner up in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the comedian talked about the process of writing one-liners. He said: ""When I think of what I think is a good joke I do often laugh, because of course it's the first time I've heard it. So I will chuckle. ""But I've been wrong many times and I'll go in front of an audience thinking this is an absolute work of genius and they stare back at me going 'Sorry you want us to laugh at this point, do you?' and I realise that doesn't work at all. ""But it also works the other way and that's the exciting thing about writing comedy - you never quite know until you try it with an audience. Never test it on family and friends."" When asked if he ever stretched his jokes to a paragraph he said: ""Only on this show would I be asked that question. It's a beautiful question 'do you ever do paragraphs?' ""I do occasionally, but what happens is I think that bit can go, and I don't really need that bit, and then eventually it's back to a line and a half again.""

"Imiela, who was jailed in 2004 for seven rapes between 2001 and 2002, was hauled in for questioning again six years later. This time he was suspected of the rape, indecent assault and serious sexual assault of a 29-year-old woman in the early hours of Christmas Day 1987 in Forest Hill, south-east London. Investigators said DNA samples from Imiela, who had also previously been convicted of armed robbery, matched with those originally taken from his 1987 victim, who died in 2006. On Thursday, Imiela, originally from Appledore, Kent, was also convicted of that attack. Following his conviction, the judge told the jury Imiela had been more widely known as the ""M25 rapist"". 10,000 calls In November 2001, former railway worker Imiela began what Kent Police described as a ""rape spree"" and attacked a total of eight women and girls between then and 21 November 2002. In each case, he would snatch his victims where they were walking, drag them into a secluded area and rape them - exactly what he had done with his first victim. The first attack, on a 10-year-old girl in Ashford, sparked what police said was the biggest investigation since the Yorkshire Ripper case, costing Â£2.1m. Up to 350 officers took about 10,000 calls from the public in response to appeals for information. More than 3,500 men were DNA-tested in the course of the investigation. About eight months later in July 2002, he raped two women on the same day - a 30-year-old in Earlswood, Surrey, and six hours later a woman, aged 26, on Putney Common, south-west London. In August, he attacked a 52-year-old woman on Wimbledon Common and, the next day, a 26-year-old woman in Epsom, Surrey. His sixth victim, in September 2002, was a girl of 13 in Woking, Surrey, and the following month he targeted a 14-year-old girl in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. Police linked the various attacks and an appeal to catch the sex predator was broadcast on the BBC's Crimewatch programme in October 2002. A month later, he struck again. In November 2002, he preyed on another 10-year-old girl - this time in Birmingham - who he indecently attacked. 'Savage and perverted' Imiela was finally arrested on a motorway in Kent weeks later. In March 2004 he was convicted of the seven rapes, which prosecutor Richard Hearnden described at the time as ""a savage and perverted campaign against total strangers"". After that case, Imiela was jailed for life with a minimum term of eight years, meaning he would have been eligible for parole later this year. In the latest court case over the 1987 attack, the Old Bailey jury was told about his catalogue of previous sex crimes. But at the time of his first sex attack Imiela was already on the run after an armed robbery. Two weeks after the rape, he handed himself in to police for the robbery and was jailed for 14 years for that crime. In the latest trial, which ended on Thursday, the court heard how the victim - who transpired to be Imiela's first in a long line of victims - had to seek treatment for mental health problems two years after the attack. After being discharged by doctors, she moved to South Africa and her marriage ended. She died in 2006 and it was another four years before the Metropolitan Police charged Imiela over the attack. Det Con Claire Watts said it was ""extremely sad"" the victim was ""no longer alive to witness justice served"". And police believe the case surrounding Imiela might not yet be closed. Det Insp John Foulkes said it was ""likely that police are unaware of all his offending"". He urged any potential victims of his from the late-1980s or between 1996 and 2002 to come forward.

"Sterte Court's cladding is different from that used on Grenfell, where 72 people died in a fire in June 2017, but has a similar flammability rating. Poole Housing Partnership said in July last year it would test the panels. However, it said there was no need for separate testing as checks had been carried out by the manufacturer. 'Not safe' Poole People Party ward councillor for Sterte Court, Andy Hadley, said he and residents had been assured fresh tests on the block's cladding would be carried out. He described news that this had not happened as ""shocking"". Sterte Court resident Bill Durrant said he was ""not 100% sure I feel safe"". Poole Housing Partnership previously agreed to replace all of the cladding at Sterte Court because of defects, including buckled panels and loose rivets. It is also set to retro-fit sprinkler systems at the high-rise. All local authorities with Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) cladding on buildings were mandated to send samples to the government. However, chief executive of the partnership, Su Spence, said the cladding at Sterte Court was not ACM but instead timber-based. She added the flammability of the cladding was ""not the key point"". ""The key point is what will happen should it catch fire and we know that the panels here - should they catch fire - will not emit the same level of flames as the ACM panels and actually will fizzle out very, very quickly,"" she said. She added: ""These panels have been tested widely to European standards by the manufacturer so there was no need for us to do a separate test.""",Cladding at a council-owned tower block in Poole has not been tested since the Grenfell Tower tragedy despite a housing association promising to do so.

"By Niall Blaney & John CampbellBBC News NI Some common plant species like honeysuckle and oak are now banned from being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. That is because NI is continuing to follow EU plant health rules, while GB is not. Some plant businesses in GB have stopped making sales to NI customers. James Barnes, chair of the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), said: ""Plant health regulations mean GB businesses now face inspections at up to four separate points in the supply chain journey, adding time and expense into the process. ""That is causing some businesses to reconsider their trade with NI."" UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs said ""overall"" businesses were ""adjusting well to the new rules"". Businesses in GB that are sending plants to NI must obtain a plant health certificate from a professional plant inspector. The government is covering the cost of those certificates, but it is a time consuming process. Details of the shipment must also be uploaded to an EU IT system known as Traces NT, at least 24 hours in advance of its arrival in Northern Ireland. A ban on GB seed potatoes being sent to NI was highlighted before Christmas, but there are prohibitions on a wider range of products which the EU considers high risk. These include Privet hedge plants, English Yews and and Elm trees. Soil is also banned from being sent from GB to NI but other lower risk growing mediums like pure peat are permitted. Orders cancelled Several amateur gardeners have contacted the BBC to say that plant companies in GB have cancelled or suspended their orders. Doreen Purce, from County Down, told the BBC she had placed an online order for seeds with an English company, only to have her digital basket emptied at checkout. ""I then rang the company and they said that they were not delivering to Northern Ireland at the minute because the paperwork was so complicated, and they had to abide by an EU directive,"" she said. ""I don't think this has been thought through. I would say that the UK's standards for food and horticulture are very high. I feel that we are very isolated now in Northern Ireland and in Ireland as a whole."" Seamus McNeill, from County Antrim, said he had placed orders with two GB companies, but both said they were unable to fulfil them because of the added costs involved. ""I have previously ordered hundreds of plug plants and the two companies I ordered with deliver to a lot of customers in Northern Ireland,"" said Mr McNeill. ""We are now deemed to be international customers. This had been a very cost-effective way for me to produce a lot of plants. ""The companies in England appreciate the customers they have here, but major difficulties have now arisen,"" he said. Mr Barnes from the HTA has called on the EU and UK to explore ways to ease the new rules. ""The impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI. ""The UK's horticulture industry stands to lose out if solutions cannot be found."" 'Adjusting well' The UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was ""working closely with the horticulture industry to ensure they can take advantage of the opportunities leaving the EU brings"". ""Overall businesses are adjusting well to the new rules and continue to trade effectively,"" a Defra spokeswoman said. She added: ""Alongside other measures, we have put in place the Movement Assistance Scheme (MAS) to support and assist traders moving plants, plant products, and agrifood from GB to NI - this minimises business uncertainty by supporting the direct costs of new certification requirements"".","Horticulture businesses are experiencing ""incredible frustration"" at the new Irish Sea border arrangements, a trade body has said."
"The executive has not ruled out bringing in the move in NI to coincide with the half-term holiday for schools. Mrs Dodds, Stormont's economy minister, said attention needed to be paid to the impact it would have on jobs. Ministers will meet on Thursday to discuss imposing more restrictions to curb the spread of Covid-19. There is speculation localised measures could be introduced in other parts of NI where cases are high, such as Newry and Mourne. A circuit breaker is a lockdown for a short period of time, possibly two weeks, to slow the spread of the virus. There were 828 new cases reported on Wednesday in the Department of Health's daily update for the previous 24 hours, with one further death confirmed. To date there have been 16,187 confirmed cases of the virus in Northern Ireland. London must 'step up' Mrs Dodds said she welcomed the interventions from the British government to aid the economy during the first wave of the pandemic, but that it was no longer enough. ""We need to see our national government in London step up and offer help across the United Kingdom to make sure unemployment does not increase and that we are supporting jobs and people through this,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. She insisted that the government's furlough scheme, due to end on 31 October, needs to be extended to stave off job losses in Northern Ireland. The minister also said any further restrictions imposed must be ""proportionate"" and be backed up by public health advice, but that she would not pre-empt any discussions ahead of Thursday's executive meeting. ""I'm perfectly at one with the fact that when it comes to health and the economy, we need to have a balanced view of where we are,"" she added. 'Substantive task' to replace jobs The head of the jobs creation body Invest NI has described the prospect of 100,000 workers here losing their jobs as ""terrifying"". Kevin Holland said it would be a ""substantive task"" to replace job losses on such a scale. He has been giving evidence to Stormont's Economy Committee. Mr Holland said prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Invest NI had planned to create up to 30,000 jobs over a three to four year period and highlighted the aerospace sector as one area that could experience difficulties in the next two to three years. Meanwhile, Finance Minister Conor Murphy has announced a grant scheme to help the north west's hospitality industry. Pubs, restaurants and hotels in the Derry City and Strabane council area have been operating under tighter coronavirus restrictions since Monday. The scheme will see small businesses receive Â£800 for every two weeks they are closed, while larger businesses will receive Â£1,200 every two weeks. The BBC understands Mr Murphy's proposal was approved by urgent procedure for sign-off from the first and deputy first ministers. The minister said the scheme was more generous than similar support packages that had been offered in Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. But SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood said that ""small grants won't cut it"", as he called for a wider support package. Last week, businesses leaders in the north west said there were serious concerns about the impact of the new measures on the hospitality industry in the region.

"Mrs Johnson, 78, died on 18 August without being able to fulfil her last wish of giving her son a proper burial. After being diagnosed with cancer last year, Mrs Johnson appealed again to killer Ian Brady to reveal the location of Keith's body, without success. More than 200 people attended the service, held at St Chrysostom's Church, Victoria Park. The hearse included floral tributes reading 'Gran' and 'Mam', with a smiling photo of Winnie on top of the coffin. A book of condolence opened at the church, with a private burial taking place following the service. 'Bingo with angels' Keith was one of five children murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley between 1963 and 1965. The then 12-year-old was abducted on 12 June 1964, and was the only victim whose body has never been found, despite several large-scale searches of Saddleworth Moor. During the service, hymns The Old Rugged Cross, Lord Of All Hopefulness and The Lord Is My Shepherd were played. Elizabeth Bond, a friend of Mrs Johnson, gave a eulogy calling her a ""woman ahead of her time"". She said: ""Her mother was a great influence in her life, and when she became a mother herself she described it as the best thing that she ever did. ""Sadly in 1964, Keith was taken away from his family and Winnie became more and more of a public figure under the tagline - Keith Bennett's mother. ""I don't want us to forget that Winnie was so much more."" She added: ""I hope you are playing bingo with the angels like you said you would and all the ones you loved are by your side when you shout house."" Floral tributes at the funeral included wreaths from Greater Manchester Police and her local bingo club. 'Candle for Keith' Assistant priest Father John Grant, said Winnie was a regular face at St Chrysostom's Church. ""The abiding memory is of her arriving and leaving church in the electric scooter and she used to come in the side door, scoot across, park up and into the front pew,"" he said. ""At the end of every Sunday service she would go and light a candle for Keith. ""We have commended her into God's care, we have prayed that she will be at peace, we have prayed that she is reunited with Keith."" The day before Mrs Johnson's death, police said they were looking at claims Brady had revealed details about Keith's grave to his mental health advocate, Jackie Powell, from Carmarthenshire, south Wales. Mrs Johnson's solicitor John Ainley said she had not known about the latest development as ""she wasn't capable of accepting it"". Teresa Walsh, who helped Winnie search Saddleworth Moor for any signs to where Keith's body might be, attended the service. She said: ""She was a very strong lady, she loved her family. ""She just never gave up looking for Keith, she just wanted to find her son, that's all she wanted, to find him and lay him to rest."" A fund has been started to provide a memorial to Mrs Johnson inside the church and a community garden at the side of the building.","The funeral of Winnie Johnson, mother of Moors murder victim Keith Bennett, has taken place at a Manchester church."

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething told the Senedd that Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which serves north Wales, had shown ""genuine progress"". The board went into special measures in 2015 after a report found institutional abuse at a mental health ward. The three-and-a-half year package will provide up to Â£82m per year. Plaid Cymru said the money was welcome but said the health board had ""had its day"". In his statement to the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Gething said: ""The heath board has recently submitted a comprehensive and balanced account of progress during the period of special measures escalation. ""This shows genuine progress but also insight and acceptance of areas for ongoing action and improvement."" Some services, including maternity and out-of-hours, have already come out of special measures. ""Measures of quality, such as responding to concerns and infection prevention and control, demonstrate that historic performance issues have been addressed,"" Mr Gething said. He told the Senedd the board had made a ""positive and sustained response to Covid-19"" in the most difficult of circumstances. He announced he would be giving longer-term funding to tackle ""disproportionately poor"" performance in high-profile areas such as referral to treatment and accident and emergency services. The funding is being provided to enable the board to plan sustainably for the future, he said. It will provide: The minister will also establish a task and finish group to make recommendations on a proposed north Wales medical school. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorweth said the board had ""had its day"" and and the north needed new health and care structures. He added: ""Additional money is welcome of course, but sadly, this statement reads largely like any one of the statements that we have heard over the past five and a half years since Betsi Cadwaladr was put into special measures - some improvements claimed, and other areas highlighted as needing more work.""",A health board which has been in special measures for five years is to get a multi-million pound assistance package to help it make improvements.
"Nearly 50,000 immigrants may have obtained English language certificates in the UK, despite not being able to speak it. Wrexham-based Glyndwr, one of the institutions identified, has lost its right to sponsor foreign students. The university said it was ""deeply upset"" by the suspension. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire told the House of Commons an inquiry into abuse of the student visa system found evidence of criminal activity. English language certificates are required for a UK student visa, and the probe followed a BBC Panorama investigation. Of the 48,000 certificates concerned, 29,000 were invalid, 19,000 were ""questionable"" and Mr Brokenshire admitted it was ""likely that the true totals will be higher"". Officers uncovered evidence of ""serious concern"" at some campuses, and the UK government has downgraded Glyndwr University from its status as a ""highly-trusted sponsor"" of student visas. In addition, 57 private further education colleges had their licences for admitting foreign students suspended. Roughly 3,040 of Glyndwr's 8,800 students are from overseas (non-EU). The Home Office said concerns centred primarily ""but not exclusively"" on its London campus, where 2,050 overseas students study. About 680 overseas students are in Wrexham, but Glyndwr also has campuses at St Asaph in Denbighshire, and Northop and Broughton in Flintshire. There are 230 Glyndwr-sponsored students with invalid language test results, which rises to 350 when questionable results are included. The Home Office said existing Glyndwr overseas students could continue studies during the suspension. Those with a visa, but yet to travel, are advised to wait until after the suspension. The university said it was ""deeply upset,"" an investigation was under way and it hopes to get the licence re-instated. It added: ""To be put in this position by external partners is frustrating as Glyndwr University takes its responsibility as a highly trusted sponsor very seriously and is committed to supporting the continuing education of those genuine international students who demonstrate full compliance with their immigration requirements."" 'Outraged' Beth Button, president of the National Union of Students Wales, said: ""This action could have grave and irreversible consequences for thousands of students studying at Glyndwr University, through no fault of their own."" The union said it was ""outraged that this news was first announced in the House of Commons"", with students made aware afterwards. Labour's shadow Home Office minister, David Hanson, said it amounted to ""systematic abuse on this government's watch"". Aled Roberts AM, the Welsh Liberal Democrat's education spokesman, said: ""I'm worried about the effect this announcement could have on Glyndwr University's attempts to improve their financial footing."" Immigration minister Mr Brokenshire told the Commons the revelations followed an investigation into the European subsidiary of an American firm called Educational Testing Services (ETS). The ""systematic cheating"" typically involved invigilators supplying or reading out answers to rooms of gangs of imposters being allowed to step into the exam candidates' places to sit the test, he said. A criminal investigation has been launched.",Glyndwr University has been suspended from recruiting overseas students after a Home Office investigation into alleged visa fraud.
"By Sherie RyderBBC UGC hub and social news James Tayler, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, posted on Twitter he had a very good reason to be ""ridiculously"" proud of his 18-year-old son, Jacob. When Jacob finished his Saturday job at a Clarks shoe shop, he was handed a ""celebration alert"" from the store. The alert was prompted by an email from a shopper to say Jacob had gone ""above and beyond"" their expectations back in March, when helping the customer's daughter. ""I might be a little choked up,"" said James in his tweet. Sensory overload Jacob told BBC News: ""I was asked to measure a little girl's feet. ""I didn't know she had autism but she wasn't responding very well. ""She was having sensory overload in the shop environment.""

Among those to see the tweet was Dawn Brown, the customer who had emailed Clarks. ""Everyone loves a little bit of kindness,"" she responded to James's tweet. ""I am so happy that Jacob got his recognition,"" Dawn tweeted in a conversation with James. ""Teens today are given bad press, not enough praise."" ""Most people only email/phone to complain these days,"" said Dawn. ""I like to go the other way and spread the praise."" She also joked she would ask Jacob for his autograph when they next bought shoes, to which Jacob said to let him know when so he could be there.

"West Midlands Police said a ""good natured"" gathering turned sour when a disturbance broke out. Video shared online - believed to show the incident - shows two black men standing behind bins as a group throws bottles and other missiles. The force said both men were searched, after it was alleged one had brandished a knife, and escorted from the scene. The video shared online shows three police officers arrive and attempt to stand between the crowd and the two men. More items are thrown and a window is broken, before one of the two men is put in handcuffs. Hundreds of supporters had gathered in the city centre on Tuesday evening to mark the club's ascent to the Championship. No-one was injured amid the skirmish at about 21:15 BST, the force said, but an ""intoxicated"" 17-year-old male was taken to hospital after falling and sustaining a head injury. A window was broken during the disturbance, and a knife was later recovered from a bin, the force said. Another video posted online, apparently filmed next to the Lady Godiva statue in Broadgate, where the celebration took place, shows Black Lives Matter placards on the ground.

"The cockpit voice recorder from the accident off Shetland in 2013, in which four people died, was recovered by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch. Prosecutors have not been able to access vital data to examine whether anyone was criminally responsible. A hearing was held at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has the right to initial access to the cockpit voice recorder but it routinely chooses not to hand over the material to other bodies - in this case the Crown prosecutors. The BBC Scotland news website revealed last year an order was being sought at the Court of Session to access the data. It is a rare legal move. At the Court of Session, BBC Scotland reporter Huw Williams Lawyers for the Air Accidents Investigation Branch have argued that effective investigation of accidents, and the prevention of future incidents, depends on a ""no blame"" culture in which personnel know they can cooperate with investigators without fear of facing legal or disciplinary action. The Lord Advocate is applying to force the AAIB to release the cockpit voice recordings and data from the Super Puma helicopter. He says that is necessary for the effective administration of justice, and so prosecutors can have access to the best possible evidence. But lawyers for the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) cited a near miss at Schipol which resulted in the prosecution of a number of air traffic controllers. They said that meant a 50% reduction in the number of incidents voluntarily reported at the airport in following years. Balpa said the Crown Office had failed to show why the release of information was strictly necessary, and had failed to take into account any adverse impact on future accident investigations. Aidan O'Neill QC, representing the union, said the presumption against disclosure should apply in the case. The judge, Lord Jones, said he would try to make his determination as quickly as possible but warned it could take a while. Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland QC, Scotland's top prosecutor, is seeking the order for disclosure of the voice recorder data recorder under the Civil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations 1996. Section 18 covers disclosure of relevant records, and the Crown can act if it believes it to be in the public interest. Lawyers for the Crown Office argued on Tuesday that any possible negative effects of releasing the information were outweighed by the demands of justice in the case. Andrew Brown QC, for the lord advocate, said the court was required to carry out a balancing into the competing interests. The AAIB's legal team argued that the lord advocate had not made a sufficient case to overcome the high hurdle which mitigated against disclosure of the information. The British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) claims that any benefit arising from granting such an order is outweighed by the adverse domestic and international impact such action may have on the investigation into the crash or any future safety investigation. Aidan O'Neill QC, for the union and helicopter pilots, said there was ""no suggestion or hint that a crime has been committed here"". A total of 18 people were on board when the Super Puma crashed on its approach to Sumburgh. Helicopter passengers Sarah Darnley, from Elgin, Gary McCrossan, from Inverness, Duncan Munro, from Bishop Auckland, and George Allison, from Winchester, lost their lives. Martin Tosh, who survived the crash, told BBC Scotland: ""We just need answers. This is the reason why, every day, I look and try to find out, because we do not get told very much."" The judge will rule at a later date whether the evidence should be handed over.",Scotland's top law officer has gone to court to try to get air accident investigators to hand over the black box from a North Sea helicopter crash.
"Schools in the Borders and Shetland open today, with most others going back from Wednesday - but how safe will pupils and teachers be? Is it safe for schools to reopen? The Scottish government insists that it is. Scotland has had one of the highest coronavirus death rates in Europe, but infection rates are now generally very low across the country. Only about 170 children under the age of 15 have tested positive for Covid-19 in Scotland since the pandemic began - and none have died. The government points to studies from other parts of the world which suggest that children could be much less likely to be infected than adults, generally develop milder symptoms and may be less likely to spread the virus to others. Experts from the NIHR Southampton Biomedical Research Centre concluded that ""children do not appear to be super-spreaders"" and there was no need for schools anywhere to remain closed. However, the scientific evidence is by no means conclusive - and the Scottish government admits it is less clear for older, secondary school pupils than it is for younger children. But it says keeping schools closed is bad for children's health and wellbeing, and that ""the balance of risk is now strongly in favour of children and young people returning to school full-time"". What safety measures are in place? Scotland's schools are going to look and feel very different to how they did before the pandemic. The government says there is no need for primary school children to socially distance - but secondary schools should encourage pupils to distance ""where possible"". This means older pupils will be urged not to crowd together, especially indoors, or touch each other. Adults will need to keep at least 2m apart from each other and from pupils if possible - although it is accepted that this is not realistic for teachers dealing with nursery age children. No-one will need to wear face coverings, apart from staff who have close personal contact with a pupil for an extended period of time. But anyone who wants to wear a face covering should be allowed to do so. All schools will have to provide adequate hand washing and sanitizing facilities - and ensure they are properly used - and there will be enhanced ventilation and cleaning. Specific rules vary from school to school, but class sizes could be changed and many are staggering drop-off and pick-up times. They should try and keep pupils in consistent groups, like a class or year group. Some are making pupils eat lunch in their classroom rather than the canteen, and staggering break times. Schools are urged to use outdoor spaces as much as possible, but music and singing ""should be avoided during the initial return to school"". How safe do teachers feel? Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, says many of its members still have serious concerns. It carried out a survey of about 25,000 teachers last week. While the majority (64%) supported the decision to re-open schools, only a fifth were confident schools were currently safe. There have been calls for the routine testing of staff, even if they have no symptoms of the virus. The EIS said there was ""strong support"" for the use of face coverings among its members. Some teachers have questioned why they will need to wear one on the bus to work, but not while surrounded by pupils. What happens if someone tests positive? Anyone who thinks they might have the virus should stay at home, and pupils or staff who show possible symptoms at school will be told to follow the national rules on testing and self-isolation. If anyone connected to the school tests positive, the local health protection team will then assess what further action is needed. The school could potentially shut temporarily, although Education Secretary John Swinney has said that this will ""not necessarily"" be the case. Any significant rise in the number cases either locally or nationally could lead to schools moving to a part-time model or even closing completely for a time. What if I don't want to send my child to school? Many parents struggled with home learning and are looking forward to the return to school. However, the government accepts this is not the case for everyone and that some parents might want to keep their children at home. The government says schools and local authorities should offer reassurance about safety and encourage parents to allow their children to return to school. Rules on compulsory attendance ""should only be used as a last resort"". All children and staff who have been shielding are expected to return to school, unless they have been given medical advice not to do so.",Scottish pupils are returning to the classroom this week for the first time since schools closed in March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

"By Andrew PickenBBC Scotland News The BBC is challenging a decision by Lady Smith, chairwoman of the inquiry, to stop details of an employment tribunal against her being aired. Roddy Dunlop QC said Lady Smith's clear aim was to protect the inquiry. But BBC lawyers have argued there was a public interest in reporting details of the claim at the earliest opportunity. The 2019 employment tribunal - alleging discrimination, harassment and victimisation - was brought against the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry (SCAI) and its chairwoman by a former senior member of the inquiry legal team. Lady Smith denied any wrongdoing and the tribunal claim was later abandoned. Roddy Dunlop QC, advocate for the SCAI, told the Court of Session, that an ""impartial observer would not think anything amiss"" with the senior judge's approach. 'Freedom of the press' He said: ""Yes, Lady Smith had an interest in the orders that were pronounced. But the interest was not an illegitimate interest, a disqualifying interest. That interest was in furthering the aims of the inquiry and protecting participants to it. ""The reasonable observer would understand that those orders were imposed by an independent chair of longstanding and impeccable repute, who would hold to her judicial oath."" Mr Dunlop said the BBC had presented an ""empty argument"" because an alternative remedy for the corporation, as per the detail of the media restriction order, was to present a request to Lady Smith with what it wanted to report on the case. Kenneth McBrearty QC, acting for the broadcaster, said the idea of seeking this permission ""turns everything on its head in terms of the freedom of the press"". He added: ""The media is not in the business of asking for permission to publish specific matters which are otherwise in the public domain. It would be considered contrary to journalistic ethics to cede editorial discretion to a party who is the subject of a story. ""And for good reason, it is all wrapped up in what we regard the freedom of the press to tell a story."" The Court of Session heard on Tuesday that the employment tribunal claim was brought in July, 2019, by the inquiry's former lead junior counsel, John Halley. A news release, issued by SCAI in October 2019, confirmed existence of the claim and a denial that Lady Smith had discriminated against Mr Halley. An initial hearing took place that month and Mr Halley abandoned the tribunal two months later. But Mr McBrearty QC said the SCAI news release did not include the full detail of the tribunal and in effect presented one side of the claim ""by a party to proceedings which they wish to report on"". Mr Dunlop told the Court of Session the corporation's case was ""academic and unfounded"" as the original restriction order had been overtaken by another order. Both sides have finished presenting their arguments in this civil challenge and Lord Boyd has now retired to consider them.","A senior judge was right to limit the reporting of a Â£2.6m legal claim against Scotland's child abuse inquiry, a court has been told."

'Angry and disappointed' Insp Marcus Kennedy said It was ""frustrating"" for officers forced to deal with ""such a clear breach of the current restrictions"" which had been ""in place for some time"". ""There is no excuse for this type of behaviour,"" he said. University vice-chancellor Prof Graham Galbraith said he was ""angry and disappointed"". He added: ""I want to be clear that any student found to have broken the laws in place will face swift disciplinary action by the university as well as any fines that may be issued by the police."" There have been 306 new coronavirus infections recorded in the city in the the past week, with most in younger adults, and 1,390 positive test cases in total.",Large crowds fled from police as they broke up a street party outside a block of student flats.
"A wrist guard, for use with a bow and arrow, and shards of pottery were also discovered with the remains at Drumnadrochit, near Inverness. The artefacts were found in a burial cist uncovered during work to build Drumnadrochit's new health centre. The wrist guard suggests the remains are those of man. However, archaeologists have still to confirm the gender of the person who lived in the area about 4,500 years ago. Tests may also reveal how the person died. Heather Cameron, of NHS Highland, said: ""It is perhaps fitting that the site of what will be Drumnadrochit's newest public building should have had the remains of what may well have been the community's first resident. ""The skeletal remains are 4,000-4,500 years old, dating back to the Early Bronze Age."" She added: ""We are particularly excited to have uncovered the pottery and wrist guard in what appeared to be a second grave next to the first. ""I think we will be looking to mount a display on the finds somewhere in the new building when it opens at the end of the year."" Mary Peteranna, of AOC Archaeology Group, has been working on what she described as ""significant"" finds for NHS Highland. She said: ""The shards are of around two-thirds of a beaker pot which will probably have been around 20-30cm high. ""What makes them particularly interesting is that there is some organic material adhering to the base of the pot, so we may find out something about its contents. ""The shards have a distinctive decoration which may have been made on the clay before firing in a stabbing movement with something like a feather quill."" The archaeologist added: ""The wrist guard is also particularly exciting. It has holes so that it could be tied to the wrist with a leather strap, and may have been ornamental or functional."" NHS Highland said it was possible further finds could be made as the construction work progresses.",Skeletal remains found in a village on the shores of Loch Ness have been identified as dating back to the Early Bronze Age.
"Education Minister Leighton Andrews dropped earlier plans from the language commissioner for being too complicated. Plaid Cymru expressed disappointment that the measures would not extend to a wider range of organisations. The standards are due to be in place by November next year, with more to follow ""as soon as possible"", ministers said. Announcing the timetable for the regulations to establish the standards, Mr Andrews said: ""The consultation document for the first set of standards will focus on enabling the Welsh language commissioner to impose duties on local authorities, national park authorities and the Welsh ministers."" The standards are at the heart of legislation passed in 2011 to promote the Welsh language. They place binding duties on organisations to allow people to use services through the medium of Welsh. 'Paucity of vision' But Plaid Cymru's language spokesman Simon Thomas said: ""I'm disappointed that the minister has decided to confine the Welsh language standards to local and national government only. ""This demonstrates a paucity of vision. ""The purpose of this measure was to ensure a better provision of services for Welsh speakers and to ensure that Welsh is a truly equal language here in Wales. ""For this to happen these measures need to extend beyond statutory government bodies. ""There is no reason, especially given the time taken, why the standards cannot be prepared for all those bodies covered by the old Welsh Language Act as well as considering new areas such as telecommunications."" Responding to the criticism, the Welsh government said: ""We are committed to promoting and facilitating the use of the Welsh language, and to work towards ensuring that the Welsh language is treated no less favourably than the English language. ""We also want to ensure that more people have the opportunity to use Welsh in their day-to-day lives."" 'Clarity' The spokesperson said the consultation document was focusing on local councils, national parks and the Welsh government because ""they are organisations that have a wide ranging influence within the communities they serve"". ""Placing Welsh language duties on these organisations will have a big impact as far as the language is concerned. ""Further sets of standards will follow as soon as possible."" Welsh language commissioner Meri Huws said the minister's timetable provided clarity as to when standards were expected to come into force.","A new set of Welsh language standards will impose duties on the Welsh government, councils and national parks, ministers have announced."
"Nelson Nelson, 29, assaulted the pair at Nottingham railway station on Saturday and then charged at police with a makeshift club, British Transport Police (BTP) said. Nelson, of Aldridge, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to seven charges at Nottingham Magistrates' Court. Both BTP officers needed hospital treatment for their injuries. Nelson was asked if his journey was essential as he boarded a train and he ""took exception to this"" and became abusive, BTP said. As they tried to take him away he punched both officers in the face, knocking one unconscious. He dragged the other in to the road, in front of an oncoming bus, and then ran off to a building site opposite the station, the force said. When more police arrived he charged them with a ""plank of wood with nails in it"" and hit a police dog ""multiple times"" with it before he was arrested. Ch Insp Gareth Davies said: ""There is never an excuse for this sort of behaviour, but it's all the more shocking to think this violent rampage began after Nelson was simply asked if his journey was essential."" Nelson, of Stonnall Road, admitted two counts of assault, two counts of actual bodily harm, one count of possession of an offensive weapon and one of possession of a knife, and another count of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.

"Mark DevenportPolitical editor, Northern Ireland@markdevenporton Twitter But the ""no pacts"" approach appears to have paid dividends, with the cross-community party's vote up overall and the ultimate prize of a Westminster seat, succeeding Lady Sylvia Hermon in North Down. The DUP had hoped a victory in North Down might balance out defeats elsewhere. At the time of writing, the DUP not only looks to have missed its number one target, but is also at real risk of losing two of its Belfast seats. So a depressing election for the DUP, who have also lost their power broker role at Westminster, now Boris Johnson is on course to get a majority. In his acceptance speech, Stephen Farry underlined the need to get Stormont back - a message echoed by the DUP's Alex Easton. We may be on course to have three pro-Remain MPs from Northern Ireland who take their seats in the Commons chamber - one Alliance and two SDLP. But the challenge they face will be how to make a difference? They had hoped to ""Stop Boris and Stop Brexit"", however that's not going to happen. They will provide a voice, but to what end given the Conservative victory? Stephen Farry says he will do his best to ""take the rough edges"" off Brexit. Whilst Sinn Fein may take a hit in Foyle it looks like they will claim a major scalp in North Belfast, in the shape of the DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds. Given the clear indication that voters have completely lost patience with the Stormont stand off, will the DUP now refocus on power-sharing and seal a deal with Sinn Fein? Or will a wounded DUP leadership find it hard to sell a compromise over issues like the Irish language at a time when Downing Street is pressing full steam ahead with a form of Brexit so unpalatable to unionists? Whether it's Julian Smith or a new Northern Ireland Secretary handling the forthcoming talks, the next few weeks could prove decisive.",Alliance took some heat early on in the election campaign for not standing aside in certain seats as part of a pro-Remain coalition.
"Lord Elis-Thomas said the Prince of Wales was as enthusiastic as he was about the idea. The recently-appointed culture, tourism and sport minister was speaking at a Wales Office reception in London. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood denounced the idea as an ""out-dated gimmick"". The Oxford English Dictionary describes a principality as ""the territory held or governed by a prince"". Wales has not been a principality since the 16th century and the Welsh Government itself has denied that Wales is one. Lord Elis-Thomas told guests at the event: ""We are going to promote the principality of Wales as a wonderful principality."" He said ""the Prince of Wales is as enthusiastic as I am"" about marketing Wales ""as a principality within the United Kingdom"". Lord Elis-Thomas joked: ""Anybody who doesn't like this word, I will see you at the end."" The Welsh Government said in a statement in 2008: ""Wales is not a principality. Although we are joined with England by land, and we are part of Great Britain, Wales is a country in its own right."" On Tuesday, a Welsh Government spokesman told BBC Wales: ""This is not Welsh Government policy and we cannot comment further on personal remarks made at an event attended by the minister in a personal capacity."" Lord Elis-Thomas is a former leader of Plaid Cymru who quit the party in 2016 to sit as an independent member of the Welsh Assembly, pledging to support the Labour-led Welsh Government.

The 33-year-old's work has been shared by the festival's Facebook community, sparking comments including a simple ""wow"" and ""get that on canvas"". Each picture takes Ms Davies about three hours to complete and is painted from a reverse image. ""I didn't expect the comments and praise I've had, I'm really blown away by it all,"" she said. Ms Davies, who works in customer services, moved from her home in Cardiff to be with her sister in Gloucester for the lockdown.

"By Paul HeaneyBBC News David Edwards, 95, had a French school named after him for his work promoting peace and understanding. Mr Edwards died at home in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, leaving Diane, his wife of more than 70 years. One of his sons, Chris, described him as his ""hero"" and vowed to continue his work with schools. ""Dad always said 'freedom' was a very powerful word, but the first four letters - free - is a bit of a misnomer, because he said freedom will always cost,"" he said. Caroline de Pechy, a head teacher from Normandy, first met Mr Edwards in the summer of 2000, when her new school in Mondrainville, near Caen, was named after the Normandy veteran and fellow ex-soldier Tom Griffiths. How a photograph led to a four-decade friendship His link to the village stretched back decades - to a photo in the rubble of a farmhouse, just after D-Day in 1944. Mr Edwards had signed up at 19 and joined 2nd battalion Monmouthshire Regiment, 53rd Welsh Division, and was one of thousands who fought to liberate France. Sheltering in a ruined building, he spotted a photograph among the devastation. ""I just picked it up and kept it, you know as a kind of souvenir of the war, something to remember the place by,"" he said in 2014. He was wounded in 1944, but returned back to his unit to fight through into the Netherlands and Germany, and was later sent as part of a peace-keeping force to the former Yugoslavia, before returning to Abergavenny in 1946. After a 30-year career in the police force, Mr Edwards retired and went back to Normandy with Mr Griffiths for the 40th anniversary of D-Day. The pair decided to try to find the house in the photo - and villager Jean-Louis le Goffe recognised it as his family's home. It led to a four-decade friendship between the men, the village and the local school. 'A beautiful soul' Mr Edwards would regularly come back to speak to the pupils about his time fighting to liberate their country. Ms de Pechy, head teacher of the Edwards-Griffiths school, said: ""I hope that in his heart, every single smile on our pupils' faces lightened the weight of the sacrifice they made. ""He was a beautiful soul and no doubt a great man - he leaves a legacy of tolerance and I think his legacy continues for many, many years."" Wayne Jones, head of Llanyrafon Primary school in Torfaen, where Mr Edwards also gave talks to pupils, said: ""David spoke about peace and reconciliation as much as the events of those dark days of the war. ""David was, quite simply, a hero and - at the same time as we send our deepest condolences to his family - we also celebrate the life of an exceptional man.""","Tributes have been paid to a D-Day veteran who spent decades teaching ""peace and reconciliation"" to children in France and Wales."
"For almost a thousand years it has been the centrepiece of congregational singing across the UK. But a ""dreadful shortage"" of organists has left many places of worship silent. The Royal School of Church Music (RSCM) is now offering courses across Wales to attract more people to play the instrument. ""There's a really urgent need to address a national shortage of organists in England and Wales,"" said Carmarthen course leader Meirion Wynn Jones. ""Many churches and chapels now have no-one to play, which is very sad. ""In a lot of others, they have piano players who have been forced to play every Sunday but haven't had the opportunity to be taught at all."" Aimed at ""average players"" of grade three or four, the scheme focuses on playing hymns and songs with confidence, as well as how to deal with the many stops on an organ. Launched last year, the course has already attracted a ""wide age range"" of people. Among those was Daniel Smith, 23, of Aberystwyth, who has been playing since he was 11 years old. ""I like that you use not just the keyboard, but pedals, and there are so many combinations of stops to choose from,"" he said. ""The course has given me so much more confidence and helped me develop my technique and explore the full repertoire of the organ."" Other places of worship have also taken matters into their own hands to address the decline. Dafydd Huw, 26, was the first to benefit from an organ scholarship, established by the Tabernacle Baptist Chapel in Cardiff city centre. ""When I was sitting in my chapel, I was thinking, 'One day, I'd like to sit up there and make as much noise as the women is doing up there',"" he said. ""Slowly I [was] introduced and got lessons and was lucky enough to win the Dewi Watcyn Powell's scholarship. I'm enjoying the lessons very much."" The deadline for registration to the RSCM course is 11 September.","It may have been hailed as the ""king of all instruments"" by Mozart, but the future for organ music sounds distinctly off-key."
"Boris Johnson confirmed in January UK residents returning from Covid hotspots would have to quarantine in hotels. But a timetable for the new measure has still not been confirmed, with Labour saying the plans are in ""chaos"". The PM had said there would be an announcement on Thursday, but No 10 later said he had been ""misinformed"". Home Secretary Priti Patel had also told the Commons that more detail would be provided to MPs this week. But Mr Johnson's official spokesman confirmed the announcement would not come until next week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted there wasn't a delay to bringing in the hotel quarantine policy, adding that ""what there is, is work to make sure that the border is always as secure as it needs to be"". Mr Hancock said the government was working ""at pace"" adding: ""It's important to get it right."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who wants everyone coming into the UK from any country to be quarantined, with exceptions for transporting food and medicines - said he was ""really worried about the chaos and confusion on the government's borders policy"". He warned the risk was ""huge"" if the UK did not secure its borders, saying we could ""go back to square one"" if a new variant that was immune to the vaccine got through. Sir Keir added: ""We're in a race now - virus against vaccination. Let's secure our borders."" 'Yet to hear details' Demands to introduce tougher border restrictions in the UK have been growing since the emergence of new coronavirus variants from other countries, such as South Africa. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps introduced the requirement for travellers to have a negative test result before arriving in the UK last month, but critics continued to call for mandatory quarantine in hotels for all arrivals - echoing similar moves in Australia and New Zealand. At the end of January, Mr Johnson confirmed this rule would be introduced, but only for UK nationals and residents returning from 30 ""red list"" Covid hotspots. However, hotel industry leaders said on Thursday they are ""yet to hear details"" of government plans. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the boss of Best Western, which has 250 hotels in the UK, said beyond ""very broad information"" about timings, hoteliers had not had ""any discussions at all"" with government. Rob Paterson added: ""In any normal company, if you went out and announced a programme nationally and you hadn't thought about how you were going to plan that, and you hadn't spoken to the people involvedâ¦ I'm not sure I'd have a job if I did that in my company."" He said his industry ""needed some assurance of what demand levels are going to be"", as well as clarification on ""security protocols"". Chief Executive of industry body UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said: ""Hotels have offered their help to the government, but we are yet to hear any details on the scheme. ""We are ready to provide assistance as and when hotels will be needed."" The Immigration Services Union - which represents workers for the UK Border Force - also claimed ""nothing has been communicated"" to them or staff.

"Parents objected to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) being part of the panel for the inquiry into maternity failings at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust. NHS Improvement said the decision to abandon it was made after ""feedback from the families"". Mother Rhiannon Davies said she was glad parents' voices had been heard. More than 200 families have raised concerns about maternity care at the trust as part of the review, conducted by senior midwife Donna Ockenden. NHS Improvement invited the RCOG to participate in the scrutiny panel despite questions about its recent history at the health trust. 'Offensive' Mrs Davies, whose baby Kate died in 2009, said: ""The decision to impose scrutiny on the Ockenden review team's work was an idiotic one. ""The decision to select compromised, self-interested individuals to people the scrutiny panel was offensive and legally questionable.

"Joe Storey, 27, had denied murdering Kerri McAuley, 32, who was found dead at Southalls Way, Norwich, on 8 January, but admitted manslaughter. Storey was high on cocaine when he punched mother-of-two Ms McAuley after a row about an ex-girlfriend. The jury at Norwich Crown Court took less than an hour to find Storey guilty. He will be sentenced on Friday. The court had heard friends describe a history of domestic violence which left Ms McAuley ""disfigured"" and fearing for her life. In her texts Ms McAuley described Mr Storey's behaviour as ""not normal"". She wrote: ""you are not ready to care for anyone but yourself"".

He said he was staying at Ms McAuley's home when she confronted him about his ex-girlfriend who she thought was back in contact with him. Storey said he struck her five or six times and had a phone in his hand at the time but insisted he had ""not to hit her with it"".

"Ceredigion council introduced pedestrianised ""safe zones"" in four towns last month to help businesses and maintain social distancing. Some traders labelled it a ""step too far"", but the council said the results of a recent survey were ""encouraging"". A new traffic order will allow road closures to continue for the next 18 months, the council added. ""The current view is that the safe zones will need to be in place until at least October, but this will be continually reviewed and amended if needed and in line with the number of coronavirus cases in the county,"" the council said in a statement.

"Sinn FÃ©in's Cathal Boylan said an inquiry was needed to restore public confidence following ""shocking revelations"" in a recent BBC Spotlight programme about an illegal waste site at Mobuoy, near Londonderry. ""Alarm bells should have been ringing"" as far back as 2007, he said. Environment Minister Mark H Durkan said illegal dumping was a widespread problem but he doubted the value of a public inquiry. The minister said an independent investigation had already been carried out into the Mobuoy site and a criminal investigation was under way. ""Up until the airing of Spotlight, Sinn FÃ©in's interest in this issue was minimal, or maybe it had more of an interest than it let on,"" he said. Mr Durkan outlined a number of actions he was taking to address the issues raised by the dumping at Mobuoy. Steven Agnew of the Green Party proposed an amendment to extend the inquiry across Northern Ireland, with particular reference to unauthorised quarries. ""Waste crime has not been given the attention it deserves,"" he said. The DUP's Pam Cameron said: ""Illegal waste disposal is not only an unsightly blight on our landscape but has a further cost to society regarding health and wealth. ""Evidence suggests that the crime is not happening on an ad hoc basis but instead is connected with organised crime."" Colum Eastwood of the SDLP said he was ""absolutely devastated and extremely angry"" over the existence of the dump in his constituency. Ulster Unionist MLA Tom Elliott said illegal dumping was nothing new. He said the Northern Ireland Environment Agency had allowed ""big-time criminals"" to profit from illegal dumping while cracking down on minor offenders. Mr Elliott said the answer was not a public inquiry but to put resources into tackling the major offenders. Supporting the call for a public inquiry, Anna Lo of Alliance said that if complaints made in 2007 had been followed up, ""this crime could have been stopped six years ago"". The motion was passed as amended by the Green Party.",The Northern Ireland Assembly has passed a motion calling for a public inquiry into illegal waste disposal.
"By Johnny O'SheaBBC News Online Rob Cocking's great-great-grandfather Thomas and great-uncle John were among seven men killed in the St Ives lifeboat disaster on 23 January 1939. Mr Cocking, who is the St Ives crew's current coxswain, said the men who died should ""be remembered always for what they gave and sacrificed that night"". A memorial service is being held in the Cornish town to remember the victims. ""These men were local St Ives men, they went out in the most appalling weather conditions regardless of what could happen and what the outcome would be,"" Mr Cocking said. ""They went out to save the lives of others - and in doing so tragically and selflessly lost their own lives. ""I know that I will always remember what they gave and I hope, as time goes on, we always take time to remember the ultimate sacrifice."" The night the lifeboat died On a fierce, stormy night a maroon flare went up shortly after midnight, the familiar signal to the lifeboat crew of St Ives that they should head down to the station. A large steamship had been spotted in distress, toiling in north-westerly gales of up to 100mph, two miles off Cape Cornwall to the west. It took three hours for the John and Sarah Eliza Stych lifeboat to be readied and then pulled down the streets and through the surf by 80 people. She was launched into the teeth of the violent storm at about 03:00 with eight crew members on board. Just one would return. Led by coxswain Thomas Cocking, the open topped boat struggled in the rough seas and soon got into difficulty when a huge wave knocked six of the men overboard. Two clambered back on board when she self-righted but four, including the coxswain, vanished into the raging sea. With the sail in tatters, the motor no longer engaged and the crew halved, they attempted to drop anchor and ride the storm but the cable snapped. Townsfolk watching from the headland saw a flare go up from the lifeboat, a sinister message glowing in the early morning sky that their friends, husbands, brothers, sons and grandsons were in grave danger. As the ferocious conditions swept the boat across St Ives bay, another wave smashed into it causing the craft to overturn, accounting for another crew member. The three remaining men pressed on and after yet another capsize, the vessel self-righted once more but this time washed on to rocks not far from Godrevy lighthouse. 'It is with you forever' Vera Care, who still lives in St Ives, was 12 when her fisherman father, William Barber, 37, was called out to man the lifeboat. ""It's very vivid, as if it happened last weekend. I remember it was a terrible night, well over 100mph wind. ""My mother said to my father 'you aren't going out on a night like this' but he said 'it's my duty' and off he went. ""I was with my mother and my brother in our house on Teetotal Street - I had a feeling he wouldn't come back. You can't explain that night and the winds. ""My father's body was recovered two days later. It seemed unreal. It was a very small community in those days. It was a town of mourning and it was a terrible, terrible time. ""It is with you forever. It crippled my mother, it ended her life really. She said she had to start another life afterwards."" William Freeman was the only man left with the boat, and the only survivor. Incredibly it was the first time he had ever been on the lifeboat, having volunteered on the quayside when the crew was one short. Exhausted, he fought his way over rocks and up the beach to a cliff-top farm where he was offered shelter while the farmer cycled into town to deliver the news about the lifeboat's fate. Mr Freeman died on 23 January 1979 - the 40th anniversary of the tragedy - and it was said he never again set foot on a boat. The day after the tragedy, the remains of the SS Wilton was found wrecked on nearby rocks with no survivors from a crew of 30. The John and Sarah Eliza Stych was on loan from Padstow, as the St Ives station had lost its previous boat the year before when it responded to a cruiser Alba that was wrecked off the town. All eight crew members were awarded the bronze medal for gallantry by the RNLI later that year - for seven of them the award was posthumous. The Cocking family of St Ives is intrinsically linked to the town's lifeboat station. Rob Cocking's father Thomas was also coxswain between 1967 and 1989, and his brother, Tommy, filled the role between 2000 and 2011. Rob Cocking, who became coxswain in October 2015, said: ""I wasn't ever not going to be involved with the lifeboat. ""I was raised around it and that, along with the sea, has always been a part of my mine and my family's life from boy to man. ""I was driven to be a part of this and knew in my mind that if I worked hard enough, I would be able to achieve the role of coxswain as had several of my family beforehand."" Technology has changed much about the way lifeboat crews respond. Pagers have replaced maroon flares and tractors mean the boat can be taken to water mechanically, rather than being pulled on ropes by dozens of volunteers. The slipway in St Ives has been moved to a position directly in front of the station and the boats are unrecognisable from the old open-topped, wooden craft. Mr Cocking explained: ""Back then they had a boat, a motor and a compass - yes, the boat could self-right - but that's it. ""Now we have the latest technology, safety, training and equipment to ensure that when we launch to a rescue we are as protected and safe as can be.

"Councillors in Darlington voted in 2016 to shut the Crown Street library and move the service to the Dolphin Leisure Centre to save Â£300,000 per year. The Labour-run authority also overcame a High Court challenge to the closure brought by campaigners. However, the council's cabinet has now voted to reverse the decision and save the library. Earlier this month newly-elected leader Stephen Harker said he was against the closure as finding an alternative use for the building would be difficult. A council spokesman said: ""Members agreed with the leader's recommendation to overturn the earlier decision to move the service, meaning it will stay where it is. ""There will be a consultation on how the library will look in the future, with a further report due before cabinet early next year."" Mr Harker said he now wanted to invest Â£2m modernising Crown Street to attract retailers and shoppers. Earlier this year campaigners mounted a legal challenge against the council's consultation process over the future of the Grade II-listed library. But in June the High Court ruled the council's decision to close the site should stand. Darlington has recently lost its long-established Marks & Spencer store and Mr Harker said the town's High Street was facing tough times. Mr Harker said the council's ""slightly improved finances"" over the past 12 months meant keeping the library was an option.",Plans to shut a town centre library and relocate it to a leisure centre have been scrapped.

"Chancellor George Osborne has said some control over income tax rates could be devolved without a referendum. Mr Jones told The Wales Report on BBC Wales TV that Labour would not increase income tax if they win the 2016 assembly election. But it could be considered one day, he said. ""I think in the future, what parties will have to look at is saying, we might look at increasing income tax but to pay for a specific thing"", Mr Jones told the programme. The sharing of tax powers between ministers in Cardiff and London would mean the Welsh government controlling Â£3bn of taxes a year by 2020. Underfunding claim Mr Jones told The Wales Report he was concerned by this proposal, claiming it could ""lock"" Wales into a situation where it was unfairly funded compared to the other UK nations. ""First of all we don't know when we'll have this power and secondly the funding situation we have is precarious,"" he said. The first minister pointed out that 80% of the Welsh government's funding comes from the UK Treasury, and Wales was funded less per head than Scotland and Northern Ireland. ""What I don't want is this to become an excuse for the Treasury to say we're not going to look at the fact you're underfunded because you can raise your own money through income tax,"" he said. ""That locks into underfunding and that's not fair on many of us"". The Welsh Tories have pledged a 5p cut in the 40% rate and a 1p cut in the basic 20% rate, while the Lib Dems said they would focus on a 1p cut in the basic rate to help ""ordinary workers"". Plaid Cymru has said the partial devolution of income tax is not enough, calling for fuller tax powers comparable to those offered to Scotland and Northern Ireland.",First Minister Carwyn Jones has said there is a case for income taxes to be raised in Wales to pay for specific projects.
"David CornockParliamentary correspondent, Wales Er, possibly not, if question time in the Lords today is any guide. Energy Minister Lady Verma made clear the government's frustration with the lack of detail put forward by the Hafren Power consortium behind the project. She told peers: ""Until we get some much more detailed to the plans it will be very difficult for us to make a decision."" Hafren Power says its scheme - between Lavernock Point and Somerset - would generate 5 per cent of the UK's energy needs and could be privately financed. The scheme would require a new law before it could happen and in a foretaste of debates to come the scheme's supporters and opponents made their points. Labour's Lord Anderson of Swansea said there was considerable support for the project in Wales and it would be a tragedy if the government didn't look seriously at the project. But Conservative former Welsh Secretary Lord Crickhowell said the proposals were ""at the most rudimentary stage"" and the only really positive feature was that former Welsh Development Agency chairman Lord Rowe-Beddoe was a non-executive director. Former Plaid Cymru leader Lord Wigley said the scheme would give the Welsh economy a much-needed kickstart and asked for an assurance that it would get the go-ahead if environmental issues could be resolved. But ex- Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Lord German said the scheme came with enormous costs to the environment and was a Bristol Channel barrage than a Severn estuary one. He wanted to know the costs to energy consumers of these proposals compared to other forms of low carbon energy. Lady Verma said that without more detail from the Hafren Power consortium ministers could not make an assessment on the impact to consumers. Former Labour MP Lord Howarth called for a quick decision on ""a free gift of an enormous increase in renewable energy in Britain"". Lady Verma said the consortium would no doubt be looking for subsidies on the energy generated by the barrage. Supporters of the scheme say a decision is needed this year, but it was clear at question time that ministers are a long way from a position where the scheme will get the green light.",Will this be the year that the long-discussed Severn barrage finally gets the go-ahead?
"Simon Stevens told MPs this was ""stretching it"" and there were ""clearly substantial funding pressures"". And, in clashes with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, the PM called claims of a ""humanitarian crisis"" in the NHS ""irresponsible"" and ""overblown"". But Mr Corbyn said Theresa May was ""in denial"" over the situation. There have been several warnings in recent days about the pressure on the health service in England. The Royal College of Nursing said its members were reporting the worst conditions they had experienced. In a separate move, 50 leading doctors have warned the prime minster in a letter that lives are being put at risk because of mounting pressures on the NHS - and charities working with elderly people said long-term solutions were needed. On Sunday, Mrs May told Sky News that, when the government had asked the NHS what it needed for the next five years, it had been given ""more funding"" than ""required"". But, appearing before the Public Accounts Committee, which monitors government spending, Mr Stevens said it was wrong to say ""we'll be getting more than we asked for"". Ministers said NHS England had asked for Â£8bn and been allocated Â£10bn. But Mr Stevens told MPs that was to cover six years rather than the five-year plan he had put forward. ""I don't think that's the same as saying we are getting more than we asked for over five years."" He also told the cross-party committee: ""In the here and now, there are very real pressures. Over the next three years funding is going to be highly constrained and in 2018-19, as I've previously said in October, real-terms NHS spending per person in England is going to go down, 10 years after Lehman Brothers and austerity began. ""We all understand why that is, but let's not pretend that that's not placing huge pressure on the service."" During Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mr Corbyn said the prime minister ""seems to be in some degree of denial"", saying she ""won't listen to professionals"". He added that Mrs May's ""shared society"" vision, outlined in a speech earlier this week, could mean ""more people sharing hospital corridors on trolleys"". But Mrs May said there was always greater pressure during the winter, with the UK's ageing population and ""growing complex needs"" creating extra strain. She said claims from the Red Cross of a ""humanitarian crisis"" in the NHS were ""irresponsible and overblown"" - the only way the NHS could be funded was with a strong economy. ""The last thing the NHS needs is a cheque from Labour that bounces,"" she added. She agreed to meet a cross-party group of MPs calling for politicians to put aside differences and draw up an NHS ""convention"" to secure its long-term future. The latest calls for government action come a day after documents leaked to the BBC showed record numbers of patients were facing long waits in A&Es in England. Nearly a quarter of patients waited longer than four hours in emergency wards last week, with just one hospital hitting its target, according to the data. Since the start of December, hospitals have seen only 82.3% of patients who attended A&E within four hours - the worst performance since the target was introduced in 2004. Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said she had heard from front-line nurses who wanted to give the best care they could to their patients but were told to discharge them before they were fit just to free up beds. And the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) called for urgent investment to help ""over-full hospitals with too few qualified staff"". RCP president Prof Jane Dacre said: ""Our members tell me it is the worst it has ever been in terms of patients coming in during a 24-hour period and numbers of patients coming in when there are no beds to put them in."" Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association's council, accused the government of ""wilfully ignoring the scale of the crisis in our NHS"". He added: ""Trying to play down the pressure that services are under shows the prime minister is out of touch with patients and front-line staff who are working flat out under impossible circumstances."" But a Department of Health spokesman said the NHS in England had 3,100 more nurses and 1,600 more doctors than a year ago. ""We're also joining up health and social care for the first time,"" he added, ""and investing Â£10bn to fund the NHS's own plan to transform services and relieve pressure on hospitals."" And, in a separate debate in the Commons, Liberal Democrat former Health Minister Norman Lamb asked Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt: ""Is it conceivable that some of the people who are currently within the A&E target will at some stage fall outside the A&E target in the future?"" Mr Hunt replied: ""I am committed to people using A&Es falling within the four-hour target. ""But I also think we need to be much more effective at diverting people who don't need to go to A&Es to other places, as is happening in Wales, as is happening in Scotland, and as frankly is the only sensible thing.""",The chief executive of NHS England has contradicted government claims that the health service is getting more funding than it asked for.
"It follows his failure to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. He will be absent from Parliament for some key Brexit votes. He has also been suspended by the DUP ""pending further investigation into his conduct"". Speaker of the House John Bercow called it ""a regrettable state of affairs"". Mr Bercow will now formally inform the chief electoral officer of the decision and she has ten working days to set up a petition which, if signed by 10% of North Antrim constituents, will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley having to stand down. The Recall of MPs Bill became law in 2015 under the coalition government. Sir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, said they had concluded Mr Paisley was guilty of ""serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute"". He also said the inquiry into Mr Paisley could have been concluded earlier: ""The process could have been considerably shorter if Mr Paisley had been more cooperative initially."" Sir Kevin said Mr Paisley did show a ""greater sense of urgency"" in the later stages of the investigation. Key points from the Standards Committee's findings This is one of the longest bans ever to be handed down at Westminster. According to the House of Commons library, it is the longest suspension since 1949 which is as far as online records go. 'He's a Paisley' Analysis by political correspondent Gareth Gordon Suspended by fellow MPs, and now the party his late father once ruled without dissent, these are difficult days for Ian Paisley Jnr. It's not the first time he's fallen foul of the DUP leadership but this is by far the most serious. He's made it clear he intends to fight any subsequent by-election. But what will the DUP leadership do? Some would undoubtedly like to say farewell to him for good. But... first of all he's a Paisley. Secondly, he's popular with the unionists of North Antrim who may not forgive the party if it cast him permanently aside. The DUP had to do something and they've done it. But the smart money says that after a period of suspension, Ian Paisley will still be the DUP candidate should North Antrim go to the polls before the end of the year. Mr Paisley has insisted he will fight any by-election to save his Westminster seat if he is forced to stand down. Mr Paisley's party plays a pivotal role in supporting Theresa May's minority government. In June 2017, an agreement was reached that the 10 DUP MPs would back the Tories in key Commons votes. Writing in the Ballymena Guardian on Tuesday, the North Antrim MP said he was prepared for whatever punishment came his way. He called those pushing for such an election ""opportunists"", but made it clear that he would not run away from any challenge. DUP statement The Officers of the Democratic Unionist Party have considered the report of the House of Commons Committee on Standards on Ian Paisley MP. The Party takes this report and the matters contained within it very seriously. The Party Officers have decided to suspend Mr Ian Paisley MP from membership of the Party pending further investigation into his conduct. The Party does not intend to make any further comment on these matters during the course of the above outlined process. Mr Paisley failed to declare two luxury family holidays in 2013 paid for by the Sri Lankan government. He later lobbied the then prime minister on the country's behalf. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Stephen Nolan Show on Wednesday, the political editor of the News Letter, Sam McBride, described the scale of the punishment as ""new territory"" for the House of Commons. ""This is not some minor breach of parliamentary protocol - this is something that parliament frowns upon in such a way that under this new law, they now give voters in his constituency the chance to remove him from his seat so it's very different to what has gone before."" Although the DUP said party officers took the decision to suspend Mr Paisley, Mr McBride said he believed the leader of the party, Arlene Foster, would have approved it. ""The leader is ultimately the person who carries the can for this,"" he said. ""If you're the leader of a party, you call the shots. It's pretty difficult to believe Arlene Foster was not in support of this.""",MPs have voted to suspend DUP MP Ian Paisley for 30 sitting days.

"By Nia CerysBBC News There are concerns the industry could disappear completely unless a new Fishery Order is introduced to safeguard it. The current order expires on 31 March, 2022. The Welsh Government said it was still working on renewing the Fishery Order for the area. Due to the natural environment, the Eastern Menai Strait is the largest mussel farming site in Britain, with between seven and 10,000 tonnes produced annually. The mussels have always had a prominent place on the menu of many local restaurants and are very popular with customers, said David Retallick from Dylan's restaurant in Menai Bridge. ""Everyone likes coming to the restaurant to eat mussels from the Menai Straits, locals and visitors alike,"" he said. ""They enjoy having the chance to sit and look out over the water where they were caught."" The current Fishery Order has been in place since 1962 and there have been efforts locally, for a number of years, to renew it. But the Welsh Government has not finished processing the application. James Wilson, from Deep Dock - one of the mussel-farming companies based at Porth Penrhyn in Bangor, said the order was vital to secure their future. ""The order provides us with a kind of property right on the sea bed,"" he said. ""It allows us to put juvenile mussels down on the sea bed, look after them for two or three years until they've grown to market size, and then realise the benefit of our investments. ""Without that Fishery Order, other people could come in and take our mussels and reap the rewards. ""We've got great protection here on the Straits from the island and the mainland, which prevents the weather having a detrimental effect. The sea bed here is of a particular type that the mussels can easily attach to it. ""So between that and having a well-located port, all that allows for a great place for cultivation of mussels."" Mr Wilson, who said Europe was currently the largest market for Menai mussels, added: ""Everyone's facing challenges at the moment. Covid, we'll find a way through it. Brexit, we'll find a way to adapt to it. Without the order, this is the foundation stone of the sector. ""If the Welsh Government don't provide us with the order, there will be no cultivation sector here. ""The businesses we have here, the people that are employed in this, the history, the future potential, all of that could be lost."" A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the history and success of the current Fishery Order in the Menai Strait for aquaculture in Wales. ""Despite the current challenges presented by Brexit and Covid-19, we are still progressing MSFOMA's [Menai Strait Fishery Order Management Association] application, and are working closely with them on several points of detail.""","Mussel farming on the Menai Strait could be in jeopardy unless new management measures are approved soon, according to local producers."
"They will join the 450 British troops already in the country - and will aid counter-terrorism efforts and provide leadership training. Officials have said the additional troops will not be taking part in combat operations against the Taliban. UK troops had been due to leave Afghanistan this year but will now have their mission extended into 2017. Announcing the deployment at a Nato summit in Warsaw, Mr Cameron said it was essential that Nato continued ""to work with the Afghan government and the Afghan security forces to help keep terrorists out of that country"". He said the ""UK would do more to train Afghan officers"" while deploying ""a further 50 personnel to provide additional mentoring, particularly to the Afghan air force"". He also announced MPs will vote on replacing the ageing submarines carrying the Trident nuclear missile system on 18 July. It comes after US President Barack Obama this week announced a slowdown in the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan. Of the additional UK troops to be deployed, 21 will join the counter-terrorism mission, 15 will be involved in a leadership development at the Afghan army's officer training academy, and 13 will join Nato's Resolute Support Mission. In addition, Britain is to extend its Â£70m a year funding for the Afghan security forces to 2020, committing an extra Â£178m to the Afghan government of president Ashraf Ghani. Mr Cameron said the deployment underlined his determination that Britain should continue to play a leading role on the world stage despite the referendum vote to leave the European Union. ""Britain is not going to be playing a lesser role in the world. We will make sure that we use our strength, including through Nato, to spread British values and the things that we believe in,"" Mr Cameron added. The prime minister also emphasised that President Obama had told him Britain would continue to be a reliable, strong ally outside the European Union. 'Precarious' situation It comes after it was announced that a 500-strong battalion of UK troops will be deployed to Estonia and 150 troops will go to Poland as part of the Nato response to concerns over Russia. Earlier this week, Mr Obama told reporters that the security situation in Afghanistan remained ""precarious"", with the Taliban still mounting suicide attacks in the capital Kabul and other cities. ""Instead of going down to 5,500 troops by the end of this year, the United States will maintain approximately 8,400 troops in Afghanistan into next year through the end of my administration,"" Mr Obama said. ""It is in our national security interest, especially after all the blood and treasure we've invested over the years, that we give our partners in Afghanistan the best chance to succeed,"" he added.",The UK is to send up to 50 additional military personnel to Afghanistan to train and advise security forces there.
"In a statement on the issue, the bishops said academic selection at age 11 had ""outlived its usefulness"". It called on Catholic grammar schools to operate a policy of admitting no more than 75% of pupils on the basis of academic selection by September 2014. Grammar schools have been using their own exams in place of the 11 Plus. Catholic grammar schools have done so despite advice to the contrary from the Northern Ireland Commission for Catholic Education (NICCE). The last 11-plus transfer test was held in November 2008, but there has been no political agreement on a replacement. In their statement on Thursday, the Catholic bishops said: ""We support the desire of all parents for schools that will help their children achieve academic excellence. ""We are committed to ensuring that every Catholic school has this as a fundamental aim. Moving away from academic selection improves the opportunity to achieve this."" They called for all Catholic trustees to endorse a phased transition away from the use of academic selection and for all boards of governors of Catholic Schools to engage with each other during the coming academic year to discuss how to move to ""high quality non-selective arrangements within their area"". ""The current system of academic selection at age 11 has contributed to what is in fact a mediocre performance of the school system in Northern Ireland by international standards,"" the statement added. The Auxiliary Bishop of Armagh said he accepted that the Church faced a challenge in convincing parents and some principals of Catholic grammar schools that academic selection was no longer necessary. ""I accept it is a challenge obviously, it's a challenge for all of us - it's one that I hope is being addressed in its own way in conversation with the various interests involved,"" Bishop Gerard Clifford said. ""But I think it would also have to be said that there is a strong, strong voice out there saying that academic selection at 11 years of age has served its purpose and we need to move on to a different system and to different opportunities for young people.""",The Catholic Bishops of Northern Ireland have called on all political parties to agree on a better system of transfer to post-primary schools.

"The scheme, run jointly with Crimestoppers, was also used four years ago with good results, a police spokesman said. It is part of the force's anti-drinking and driving campaign, which runs until 1 January. The size of the reward depends on the nature and seriousness of the offence. 'Dizzy spells' ""We want details of the people - where they drink, what sort of vehicle they drive and the registration number,"" Ch Insp Steve Wilson said. The earlier campaign resulted in a 12% increase in calls from Derbyshire to Crimestoppers about drinking and driving. ""We want people to tell us about anybody they know [who] are drink-driving and putting other road users at risk ... and we want to be targeted in how we use our powers so we are actually looking at the right people and not doing a blanket breathalyser of people,"" Ch Insp Wilson said.

"A new squadron of drones, known as Reapers, are due to be controlled from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire. Campaigners said the march was about highlighting the dangers of drone strikes on civilians. The MoD said the Reaper's primary purpose was to provide combat and surveillance intelligence. Campaigner Mia Evans said: ""There is a big difference between using drones for surveillance and using ones armed with missiles. ""What the pilots see on their screen is like a heat sensor - they don't know if they are seeing a militant or a child with a stick."" Reaper drones are armed with laser guided bombs and Hellfire missiles. The MoD said the Reaper was not an autonomous system and did not have the capability to employ weapons unless it was commanded to do so by the flight crew. It said the drone was bound by the same rules of engagement as a manned aircraft.",A march has taken place against plans to control unmanned aircraft operating in Afghanistan from a base in the UK.
"A spokesman for the company said a letter of apology had been sent from chief executive Peter Fankhauser to Neil Shepherd and Sharon Wood. However, Mr Shepherd and Mrs Wood said they had only been shown the letter by reporters. Christi and Bobby Shepherd died while on holiday with their father in 2006. In a statement, Mr Shepherd and Mrs Wood said: ""We haven't had this so called letter of apology. ""Its not an apology for their wrongdoing but a general offer of sympathy. It does not address the central issue that their Safety Management System failed and it does not apologise for that."" A spokesman for the holiday company said: ""Mr Fankhauser sent a letter of apology to the family on Friday"". The children's parents were responding to a Mail on Sunday report that suggested Thomas Cook received Â£3.5m in compensation for loss of profits and other expenses. The grieving family said they received around one tenth of that sum in compensation for the deaths. In a statement, Thomas Cook said: ""The Greek court, in 2010, found the deaths of Robert and Christianne were the result of unlawful action by hotel employees. ""We had the right to reclaim costs related to the trial from the hotel. The costs incurred by the company far exceed the amount that was received from the hotel."" The holiday firm had earlier said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the tragedy. ""Thomas Cook recognises that the pain caused by this terrible accident will never go away and must be still very hard for friends and family to bear,"" it added. The children, from Horbury near Wakefield, were on holiday at the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel with their father, Neil, and his now wife, Ruth, when they died. They were found by a chambermaid in a bungalow at the hotel. Their father and stepmother had also become ill and were in a coma when they were found but recovered in hospital. On Wednesday, an inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing in the case and concluded Thomas Cook had ""breached its duty of care"". It found the children had been overcome by fumes from a faulty hot water boiler housed near the bungalow they were staying in. The family was accompanied during the inquest by their local Labour MP Mary Creagh. She said Thomas Cook had stopped short of a full apology. ""It does not address the central issue that their safety management procedures and policies failed, and for that they have not apologised,"" she said. Wakefield MP Mary Creagh, who represents the family, called for a change in the law forcing holiday firms to put carbon monoxide detectors in all rental cottages and villas. A criminal trial was held in Greece in 2010 following a long campaign by the children's family. Three people, including the manager of the Louis Corcyra Beach Hotel and two members of staff, were found guilty of manslaughter by negligence and sentenced to seven years in jail. Eight other people were cleared, including two Thomas Cook travel reps. The trial cleared the firm of any responsibility.",The parents of two children who died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Corfu have criticised Thomas Cook for not apologising to them directly.
"Adrian Ismay, 52, was seriously hurt after a booby-trap device exploded under his van in Belfast on 4 March. The police said that a post-mortem examination showed he died as a ""direct result of the injuries"" of the bomb. A dissident republican group, widely referred to as the new IRA, said it carried out the attack. The organisation said Mr Ismay was targeted for training officers at Maghaberry Prison near Lisburn, County Antrim. Sue McAllister, director general of the Northern Ireland Prison Service, spent time with the Ismay family on Wednesday. She said they were ""devastated and beyond shock at what's happened"". ""Like all of us, they thought that he was on the mend and was doing really well,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""We thought he would make a full recovery, we expected him to come back to work in due course, so we're all shocked, but particularly Sharon and her daughters."" Mrs McAllister condemned the behaviour of some paramilitary inmates at Maghaberry Prison, who reportedly cheered, smoked cigars and mocked wardens at the high-security jail when news of Mr Ismay's death filtered through. ""This was just unacceptable behaviour by a very small number of prisoners,"" said Mrs McAllister. ""My colleagues in Maghaberry dealt with it professionally, with great fortitude and with the courage they display on a daily basis."" She admitted she and her colleagues in the Prison Service felt ""very angry"" on hearing the reports of the celebrations in the exercise yard of the prison. ""We encounter challenging behaviour by a small number of prisoners every day, and we deal with it with great professionalism and we do not stoop to behaving that way in response,"" she added. A man appeared in court on Saturday charged in connection with the bomb attack on Mr Ismay. Det Ch Insp Richard Campbell said it was ""yet another difficult day for the Ismay family, his friends and colleagues as they struggle to come to terms with the events of the past 12 days"". He added: ""We have spoken to the family this morning and advised them of this development. ""We are also liaising with the Public Prosecution Service in relation to the individual who is currently charged with attempted murder and causing an explosion with intent to endanger life."" The PSNI have also repeated an appeal for information on two cars that police believe may have been used by the bombers - a red Citroen C3 and a silver Skoda Fabia.",The PSNI has launched a murder inquiry into the death of a prison officer who died 11 days after being injured in a dissident republican bomb attack.
"By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI Health Correspondent The move is a result of hospital theatres not being able to work at full capacity due to staff shortages. Three out of Northern Ireland's five trusts are affected - the Belfast, Southern and Western trusts. There will undoubtedly be a knock-on effect on hospital waiting times, which are expected to reach an all-time high by the end of November. It is thought that figures could be close to or over 300,000 people waiting for a first time consultant-led appointment, an all-time high in Northern Ireland and across the UK. At this stage it's not clear how long the measure will remain in place. Skilled staff shortages The trusts said the problem was due to staff shortages, particularly skilled theatre nurses. Emergency surgery will not be affected but other operations will be postponed. The Belfast Health Trust said it could not predict how long the measure would remain in place but confirmed it was trying to recruit appropriate staff. The Southern Health Trust has suspended some surgery at Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh and on a smaller scale at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, County Down. The Southern Health Trust said its priority was to make sure there was ""appropriate numbers of nurses with the appropriate level of skill in our theatres to keep our patients safe"". ""We have been left with no option but to temporarily suspend some surgical sessions,"" it added. ""Emergency, red flag and urgent surgery is continuing as normal."" The Western Health Trust said it had theatre staffing shortages at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry. ""Emergency theatres, trauma theatre and labour ward are not affected,"" it added. ""The trust has an ongoing recruitment process in place to improve staffing levels in theatres."" While suspending surgery is not unheard of it normally happens much later in the winter months. It will add additional stress to a health and social care system that is already buckling under growing pressure.",A number of non-emergency operations across Northern Ireland have had to be suspended.
"By Steffan MessengerBBC Wales Environment Correspondent Machynlleth is following in the footsteps of more than 20 cities in England and around the world, including London and a Melbourne local authority. It is looking at ways to become carbon zero, such as improving the energy efficiency of buildings. It also wants to create an electric car club. ""To be mentioned with Melbourne and London seems a bit silly,"" William Lloyd Williams, a local butcher said. ""But it's the same problem of climate change that affects large and small communities."" Machynlleth town council backed the decision unanimously, after being presented with a petition signed by 500 locals - a quarter of the Powys market town's population. ""We felt it could be significant and symbolic to be the first town in Walesâ¦ and we've been amazed by the response,"" Dr Julia Wallond, a GP in Machynlleth said. ""Several of the local towns around us are also possibly looking at doing the same. It really seems to have caught something that is in the air."" Powys County Council has also backed a motion ""acknowledging the climate change emergency"", inspired by Machynlleth's move. It includes an ambition to make its buildings more eco-friendly, encourage renewable energy developments and ensure its pension fund divested from fossil fuels. Machynlleth town councillor Ann MacGarry said there was ""a lot of enthusiasm to make this happen"". ""There are all sorts of suggestions about trying to make the town as zero carbon as soon as possible,"" she added. Support for the plan has ranged from the women's institute to the doctor's surgery. Dr Wallond said she believed the transition to a low carbon town would provide long term health benefits, including ""more opportunities for safe exercise outside, and better air quality"". Meanwhile, Mr Williams said he hoped it would encourage people to support local businesses instead of travelling long distances in their cars. And while climate change has, in part, been attributed to our consumption of meat, sustainable farming with a low carbon footprint will also help to mitigate the risk of climate change, locals say. ""Buying the animals from local farms within a 15-20 mile radius, we process them at our own small abattoir, so that means we're processing the animals as close to point of origin as possible,"" Mr Williams said. Machynlleth councillors will now have to prepare an action plan within six months. Ideas being considered It is what Paul Allen, of Machynlleth's Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT), describes as ""multi-solving"". As director of the Zero Carbon Britain Project, he has advised both the Welsh and UK governments on measures to reduce carbon emissions. ""Doing the right thing [for climate change] has benefits in other areas as well - cost savings, health benefits, and it gives a sense of empowerment to the community that they're doing something they believe in,"" Mr Allen said. ""I think that what we'll see this year is more and more towns like Machynlleth all making their declaration, and beginning to do their plans. ""If it starts to happen here, there and everywhere then it makes a huge amount of difference."" Students studying for postgraduate qualifications at CAT in eco-design and sustainability will support the town council, turning Machynlleth into what Mr Allen describes as ""a live lab for experimental thinking"". An immediate priority will be to focus on the town council's own building - Y Plas - which is a hub for the community, and includes a cafÃ© and art gallery. Improving the energy efficiency of the listed Georgian mansion will require applying for grants from the Welsh Government. Andy Rowland, who manages local social enterprise EcoDyfi, said he hoped applications could also be made for lottery cash. ""We can set up practical schemes to enable people to take choices that are less carbon intensive,"" he said. ""And across Wales I think we have the potential to be something of a beacon.""","A small market town is throwing its weight behind the global fight against climate change, becoming the first in Wales to declare a ""climate emergency""."

"Anuerin Bevan Health Board has been told that it is ""not acceptable"" for patients to wait over six months. Health Minister Edwina Hart told AMs ""swift and decisive action"" had been taken. The board confirmed it had been censured for its unacceptable waiting lists. Mrs Hart revealed that the health board has been placed in special measures in answer to a question from Conservative AM for Monmouth Nick Ramsay on Wednesday. He said one of his constituents had to wait over nine months for a knee replacement operation, whereas similar surgery for patients over the border in England was taking ""a matter of weeks"". Assembly government targets say patients should start hospital treatment within 26 weeks of being referred by their GP. The maximum waiting time allowed is 36 weeks. The minister told AMs: ""I have made it quite clear to the Aneurin Bevan Local Health Board that it is not acceptable for patients to wait more than six months. Incumbent ""Senior officials have had meetings with the board to ensure that swift and decisive action is taken, and we have placed the health board under special measures in this regard. ""We have also ensured that the health board has developed comprehensive plans to deal with the issues. ""We are aware that it is waiting to appoint four senior orthopaedic surgeons, and it expects to treat all orthopaedic patients within the maximum waiting time by March 2011. ""It is incumbent on me to keep an eye on that, to make sure that it delivers in that respect."" The Aneurin Bevan Health Board came into being in October 2009, replacing the former Gwent Healthcare NHS Trust and the Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen Local Health Boards. The board delivers services to 600,000 people. Last week it oped the Aneurin Bevan hospital on the site of the old steelworks in Ebbw Vale. The Â£53m hospital is the first in Wales' to offer every patient their own room. A spokesman confirmed the Aneurin Bevan Health Board has been placed on special measures because of unacceptable waiting lists. In a statement, the board said: ""We have been working with the Welsh Assembly Government's delivery support unit since July 2010. ""While this is not an issue about standards and quality of service, we very much welcome the additional support they have provided to help us develop local plans to achieve the orthopaedic access target.""",A south Wales health board has been placed in special measures because patients have been waiting nine months for surgery.
"The comments were made by Jonathan Powell, who was chief of staff for former Prime Minister Tony Blair. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has said legal action is imminent over the UK's move to unilaterally extend grace periods on the checks. The checks are part of Brexit's Northern Ireland Protocol. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ is the European Commission's vice president, and took over responsibility for implementing Brexit from in January from Michel Barnier. Mr Powell said the protocol was ""the least bad option"". He said: ""It's such a silly idea to poke the EU in the eye when you need the EU to co-operate to make this thing work, get things back into supermarkets and garden centres. ""If you leave the single market and you leave the Customs unions there's got to be a border somewhere."" He added: ""Those who say they want to get rid of the protocol have to come up with an alternative and no-one in five years has come up with a workable alternative."" Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. The first of these periods was to expire at the end of March; the UK says they will be extended until October. Good Friday Agreement All parcels entering Northern Ireland would have required customs declarations from 1 April. Mr Powell also said that Brexit was always going to have an impact on the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) as the agreement was about trying to remove the issue of identity as far as possible from politics and stop it being an issue that could provoke violence. ""Obviously putting a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic would do that, putting a border in the Irish Sea also does it - it does it less because it's much less visible,"" he said. ""It infringes on the economic future of Northern Ireland. ""Northern Ireland is going to be economically part of the EU as well as part of the UK. That means that many of the decisions that will affect it will be made in Brussels. ""People in Northern Ireland will have very little ability to change those decisions in Brussels because the UK is no longer part of the EU."" Mr Powell said it could be expected that Great Britain and the EU would continue to diverge, and as this happens, people ""will feel more and more that they are economically living in Ireland"", and that Dublin would still be able ""to influence what happens in Brussels"". 'No going back' A group which includes representatives of loyalist paramilitaries - the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) - has said it is temporarily withdrawing its backing for the Good Friday Agreement due to concerns about the protocol. David Campbell, the chairman of the LCC, told BBC Newsnight on Thursday that if it wasn't for the coronavirus pandemic there would be protests on the streets over the protocol. Mr Powell, who helped to set up the LCC as part of the GFA negotiations, said: ""Mr Campbell has assured me personally there will be no violence, there will be no going back to the old days and there will be no reprise of our ghastly history."" He added: ""Withdrawing support for the Good Friday Agreement has absolutely no practical effect. The loyalist organisations did not sign the Good Friday Agreement, it was loyalist political parties."" Meanwhile, NI First Minister Arlene Foster has accused the EU of taking a ""very belligerent approach to the difficulties the protocol has caused for Northern Ireland"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme she said: ""The number of checks which are occurring between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, are so disproportionate to the risk to the EU single market, that it has become completely out of step with what the Protocol was meant to do. ""The protocol was meant to do two things. It was meant to protect the single market of the European Union, and it was meant to protect the Belfast Agreement, and frankly it is disproportionately doing one, and damaging the other.""","The UK government has been criticised for ""poking the EU in the eye"" over grace periods for Irish Sea border checks."
"Croydon Council plans to auction 24 high value vases, bowls and bottles. The 230-piece collection, which includes Ming dynasty bowls, was sold to Croydon by local businessman Raymond Riesco in 1959. But the Museums Association said Croydon's decision ""threatens not just its own reputation, but that of the museum sector as a whole"". The council says it hopes to raise money towards redeveloping Fairfield Halls, a 50-year-old arts centre which has a concert hall, theatre and gallery. 'Not the answer' The remaining 206 pieces of the collection are still on show for the public to see. Museums Association president David Anderson said: ""Croydon's decision to sell valuable Chinese ceramics threatens not just its own reputation, but that of the museum sector as a whole. ""It would undermine the widespread public trust in museums and I strongly urge them to reconsider."" Councillor Tim Pollard, cabinet member for children, families and learning, said: ""Clearly this has been a difficult decision to make, and one that we have not taken lightly."" ""But we have to look at the bigger picture for culture in Croydon, and the Fairfield Halls is very much at the heart of this."" Mr Anderson added: ""I understand Croydon Council's financial difficulties and appreciate the desire to refurbish Fairfield Halls."" ""Selling artefacts from the museum collection is not the answer.

"Jon Beresford and Beth Hewis, who run the Brinsley Animal Rescue centre in Nottinghamshire, said on one day they received 100 phone calls. They have seen an increase in hedgehogs being brought in due to more people gardening and walking outdoors. Despite best intentions the animals are often best ""left alone"", they said. ""At springtime we get lots of calls anyway with hatchings and people going into their gardens. But this year is the worst we have ever known,"" said Mr Beresford. ""Partly because it has been a dry spring and hedgehogs are very dehydrated, and because a lot of people are at home or going for walks, picking up animals they shouldn't. ""Sometimes it is a genuinely injured animal like birds who have fallen out of nests, but then there's fledglings on the ground and people pick them up and take the baby away from the mother, which causes a bigger problem."" The centre, which also takes in pets and farm animals, said it has had to turn animals away because they are full. ""It's a lot for a small charity run by volunteers and we can't deal with it all,"" added Mr Beresford. ""In one day we got 10 hedgehogs and last year we wouldn't get 10 hedgehogs in a week."" He said most of the animals were dehydrated or malnourished and then released back into the wild. ""It can get really infuriating that people will disturb them and then insist we take them. Some people are very understanding but others think the wild hedgehogs or fledglings don't have a right to be in their garden. ""People always have the best intentions but quite often they do the wrong thing and that can have fatal consequences.""

"The left side of Brett Dolby's body became trapped in the machine at Scapa Healthcare in Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire, in April last year. It was first thought the 44-year-old's screams were a Pink Floyd song being played on the radio, Ampthill Coroners' Court was told. Mr Dolby had previously operated the machine for three years. The inquest jury heard how he had been part of a team that carried out a risk assessment on the machine, which had seven emergency stop buttons. A supervisor described how he mistook Mr Dolby's screams for music being played on the radio at the factory on Woodside Industrial Estate. When asked how Mr Dolby of Houghton Regis, had got into the machine on 10 April, Stephen Giblin, the company's environmental health and safety director, said there was ""no reason for anyone to enter the machine"". ""There have been no known incidents with it,"" he said. ""The only reason he entered the machine was if he dropped something. ""A reasonable possibility is that he reached in for something and became trapped. ""He was left arm dominant, maybe he reached in."" 'Simple mechanical guard' Mr Giblin said that no foreign objects were found in the machine afterwards. He said the firm had inherited the machine, which lacked a safety guard, when it bought the factory in 2004, adding that no instructions about a guard had been left. Speaking before the court, David Rudland, from the Health and Safety Executive, said: ""It was an accident waiting to happen."" Any protection to the machine could have ""taken the form of a simple mechanical guard or an optical beam that would stop the machine if the beam is broken"", he said. The machine has since been taken out of use at the factory. The inquest continues.","A factory worker was crushed to death after being pulled into two giant rollers, an inquest has heard."
"By Kenneth MacdonaldBBC Scotland special correspondent Phoenix is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to stay in the air indefinitely using a new type of propulsion. Despite being 15m (50ft) long with a mass of 120kg (19 stone) she rises gracefully into the air. She looks a little like an airship, except airships don't have wings. ""It's a proper aeroplane,"" says the UHI's Professor Andrew Rae. As the project's chief engineer, he has overseen the integration of Phoenix's systems. ""It flies under its own propulsion although it has no engines,"" he says. ""The central fuselage is filled with helium, which makes it buoyant so it can ascend like a balloon. ""And inside that there's another bag with compressors on it that brings air from outside, compresses the air, which makes the aeroplane heavier and then it descends like a glider."" Launch satellites This ability to ""breathe"" - to switch quickly between being heavier or lighter than air - doesn't just make the plane go up and down. It is the key to driving it forward. Phoenix is the first large-scale aircraft to be powered by variable-buoyancy propulsion. It moves through the air like a porpoise through water. That means it can travel long distances and stay aloft for long periods. The point? To create a cheaper alternative to launching satellites. The wings and tail carry solar panels so there is no need to carry fuel aloft. The quasi-airship shape is based on an aerofoil, meaning it also provides lift like its wings do when the plane moves forward. Prof Rae, using two wind tunnels at UHI's Perth College campus, led the design of its aerodynamics. The technique of variable-buoyancy propulsion is already used underwater. The Scottish Association for Marine Science (also part of UHI) has a small fleet of remotely operated vehicles - they call them gliders - that gather data in the North Atlantic. They dive deep to collect data, then rise to the surface to transmit it via satellite. But air is much less dense than water and this has made the principle a trickier proposition for flight. Phoenix is the first aircraft of its size to use it. It is 15m (49ft) long with a wingspan of almost 11m (36ft) Production versions would need to be scaled up to reach the altitudes of 20km required to fulfil its intended role. An autonomous vehicle which is self-sufficient in energy could stay in the air for days, weeks, even months. The technical term is ""ultra-long endurance autonomous aircraft"". The team think it could revolutionise the telecommunications industry. 'Almost expendable' The oft-quoted rule of thumb in the space business is that putting a satellite into orbit costs its weight in gold. A Phoenix ""pseudosatellite"" could do the same job from high in the atmosphere at a fraction of the cost. Prof Rae says some aircraft can already do this but are complex and expensive. Phoenix, by contrast, is so cheap as to be ""almost expendable"". In addition to UHI, the Phoenix project involves Bristol, Newcastle, Sheffield and Southampton universities. It also involved four commercial companies and three of the UK's Technology Catapults, and has been part funded by the UK government's innovation agency Innovate UK. Winter winds The prototype Phoenix has been successfully tested inside the Drystack in Portsmouth, a huge indoor area which normally stores pleasure boats. It was used to shelter the aircraft from the winter winds although production versions would operate in all weathers. The project has involved its partners integrating the solar cells, flight control system, micropumps, carbon fibre wings and tail, reversible hydrogen fuel cell and rechargeable battery. The last of these is what enables a solar-powered vehicle to keep working all night. Now that the prototype has flown successfully, the consortium wants to collaborate with major manufacturers to take Phoenix to the next level.",Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) have helped create a revolutionary new type of aircraft.
"The cost of revamping Preston's city centre bus station could be as much as Â£23m, council officials believe. Labour leader Peter Rankin said the decision to demolish came with the caveat that he would listen to anyone who wanted to invest in the site. Heritage campaigner John Wilson said: ""This building is an icon. It's unique in its design, it's part of Preston."" He added: ""I know there's a problem on the financial side, but something as vast as this, that works, you cannot just wipe it away and say it's on the scrap heap."" Mr Rankin said the 43-year-old building costs Â£297,000 to run annually and the repair bill would be Â£5.4m to install new lifts, ramps and concrete work. He said demolishing and rebuilding a new, smaller station was better value for money. The proposal to demolish was passed at a meeting of the council executive. In supporting the decision, cabinet member for community and environment Robert Boswell said he was behind the decision to demolish in the hope it would bring forward funders to save the building. Matthew Brown, cabinet member for community engagement and inclusion, said the decision had to be taken as it would cost a 24% rise in council tax to fund refurbishments.","A ""unique"" bus station is to be bulldozed after council leaders said it was too expensive to refurbish."
"The army was deployed to help rescue motorists, some stuck for more than 12 hours, as winds speeds reached 90mph on the Rakewood Viaduct near Rochdale. Snow, ice and high winds have left the motorway shut in both directions between junctions 20 and 24. Volunteers have been taking supplies to those trapped, including a new baby. Greater Manchester Police confirmed 3,500 vehicles were stuck on the motorway on Thursday evening. Many were brought off the road, but around 200 vehicles were stuck there overnight. Police warned people not to travel unless journeys are essential, as the motorway ""remains closed indefinitely"". A spokesman said: ""We strongly urge motorists to adhere to all road closure signs as ignoring them could lead to further vehicles becoming stranded. ""This in turn could result in emergency services being diverted away from people who genuinely need their help."" Power has been restored to around 12,000 homes in Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and the Peak District. But Electricity North West said there are still 3,000 properties currently without power - mainly in Cumbria and the Peak District - with around 100 separate faults on the network, each requiring teams to attend site to make repairs. Incident manager Chris Fox said the high winds across have caused damage to the overhead line network and snow and ice have added weight to power lines, causing them to come down and poles to break. Rescuers have made lasagne for up to 1,000 drivers stuck for nearly 18 hours in the snowbound M62 near Milnrow. The lasagne was made by locals while supermarkets provided the sausage rolls. Resident Gary Foster, 49, told the BBC a 15-year old boy ""walked up to two miles to bring blankets and hot food and water. He was amazing and has come again to help"". Rochdale councillor Irene Davidson organised help at a community centre in Milnrow. She said volunteers ""trundled up towards the motorway and climbed up the embankment... to feed as many people and give as many people drinks until it turned really nasty"". She added: ""Then we had to come back in to Butterworth Hall where we got police to bring people down and diverted them down to us. ""I'd say we've fed well over 250 people now and we've got more coming in. ""[The people we helped] were very pleased to see us and so grateful. It's been absolutely wonderful. And it's actually good news for Rochdale."" Eleanor Kelly, 19, said about 30 people from Milnrow trekked through the snow to take supplies to the trapped motorists, including to a father with a baby and toddler in the car. She said: ""It's been a bit mad. We even had to warm up some hot milk for a guy stuck at the junction with two children. ""We knocked on his car and he had a five-week-old baby and what must have been a one or two-year-old girl in the car with him."" Newhey Community Primary School in Rochdale has taken in 40 people since 05:00 GMT. The school, which is just off Junction 21, has offered tea, toast and a toilet stop for stranded drivers. Headteacher Clair Gooding said: ""We've had people who've basically been in the car all night, people coming as far as York and Doncaster. ""We're still able to take a lot more. I know people are concerned about leaving their vehicles, so we're actually taking flasks of tea and coffee up to them as well. ""But if they want some food and need the toilet, do feel free to come down because I don't think the traffic is moving any time soon."" The motorway was shut on Thursday after significant snowfall and strong winds in the area, Highways England said. It tweeted that staff were still working to clear snow and deal with the many stranded vehicles. Surrounding roads such as the A672, A640 and A58 are also shut, though the A62 through Oldham has re-opened. It took Sahrah Khan 19 hours to get home from Manchester to Leeds, including 10 hours stranded on the M62. Ms Khan told the BBC that she left work at 14:00 in a positive mood, boosted by the fact her in-car sat-nav suggested her journey would be shorter than usual. ""Next thing I know it's got dark and colder and I'm stranded in the worst traffic jam of my entire life,"" she said. She passed the time by posting video updates of her ""horror journey"" on social media and said one of the night's highlights came when she found a pack of chocolate biscuits in her car. Police eventually came to the rescue in the early hours of the morning, helping stranded drivers turn around and reach a nearby service station, where sleeping mats, food and drink were provided. As soon as it started to get light, Ms Khan drove to Rochdale train station, left her car, and caught the train back to Pudsey in Leeds. 'Worried by moors' Kate, from Leeds, has been travelling with her husband and two children since 11:00 GMT on Thursday. ""It has been horrendous we've been stuck there for eight hours. I was a bit worried when we were stuck on the moors,"" she told the BBC. ""It's been the snowdrifts, the road disappears and then before you know it you can be waist deep."" The family bought food and blankets from a Tesco supermarket in Rochdale after being diverted off the M62. Two coaches of students from Leeds College of Art have been left stuck in Littleborough. Richard Sears, whose daughter Abby Louise is part of the group, said: ""They have had a four-day trip to Berlin and arrived back at Liverpool about teatime last night. ""She spent the night sleeping on the floor of the disabled toilet to keep warm along with her friends, it's every parent's worst nightmare really."" The M66 was also closed for several hours on Thursday after a crash involving 16 vehicles, and a Highways England car caught fire while helping stranded vehicles on the M62.","The M62 motorway, where hundreds of snowbound drivers had to spend the night in their vehicles, will remain closed indefinitely, police say."
"After a long day at work, for many there is nothing more comforting than curling up with a cat or the exuberant face of a dog bounding towards you when you walk through the door. In London, like other cities, it can be difficult to own a pet for a variety of reasons such as long working hours and commutes; private landlords not allowing them and incompatible lifestyles. Now it is hoped a cafe with in-house cats will give Londoners their animal fix. Popular in Japan, cat cafes are a haven for lovers of all things feline, where customers can stroke, pet and coo over the animals. Set to be called Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium - after Alice's cat in Alice in Wonderland - it is the brainwave of Lauren Pears who hopes to open the cafe in east London. Ms Pears first visited a cat cafe in Tokyo in 2008. ""It was a nice experience, it made for a better cafe all round,"" she says adding there is something ""relaxing about it, it's soothing being around an animal."" At the time she was living in Australia where she had cats but when she moved to London, the size of her flat and her work hours meant it was not practical for her to have them. Missing the comfort they provide, the idea of a cat cafe came about after she noticed people on her commute would stop to pat cats as soon as they got out of the train station. Ms Pears has decided to raise the funds needed by crowd-funding. So far, people have pledged over Â£11,000. ""We've had an enormous response by people who are excited about this idea,"" she says. The cafe would be split into three parts: an area for the cats; one where people can mix with them and another where food and drink would be served. Legally the only stipulation is that animals cannot be near the area where the food is prepared and initial conversations with health and safety experts have been positive. The cafe would have about 20 cats, which would come from Mayhew Animal Home who would make sure the animals that are re-homed there feel comfortable around people. Cat-lover Louise Ault, 25, loves the idea because her job as a manager in the entertainment industry and the size of her rented flat in Hammersmith mean she cannot own one. ""I have a hectic job so it wouldn't be fair to have a cat,"" she said. ""Cats can take care of themselves but you still need to be there."" 'Bored and unexercised' Compared with the rest of the country, fewer people in London own pets. Across the UK, 18% of households own a cat while 24% have a dog according to a survey by the Pet Food Manufacturer's Association. These figures drop to 10% and 7% respectively in London. Of those that do have a pet in London, 39% said they had one for companionship. Mayhew Animal Homes says low pet ownership could be because of work and housing restrictions. ""We don't necessarily re-home pets with a garden, as flats can be more than suitable but some people may want a size or breed of pet which just isn't suitable for their environment,"" says a spokeswoman. ""Working hours would be a large factor for being unable to have a pet as naturally they need company, stimulus and exercise and this can either mean paying for a pet sitter or dog walker, or restricting your pet to hours alone, bored and unexercised in your property."" Foster care A survey by the Dogs Trust found of the people who had pets when they were looking for privately rented accommodation, 17% did not find a property which allowed pets while 32% took at least three months to find a place. Of the 384 people surveyed, 16% kept the pet without the landlord's consent. A spokeswoman for the charity said: ""We often hear from pet owners who have been forced into rented accommodation; this causes concern as many landlords operate a strict no-pet policy. ""Dog owners find themselves faced with the heartbreaking decision to give up their pet or resort to extreme measures to ensure they can live with their dog, such as living in a car or pitching up a tent in a friend's garden - we have heard some remarkable stories of determination."" It is these factors which make re-homing very difficult. Jenny Eden, branch manager for the RSPCA's central and north-east London branch, said it was getting harder each year. Last year they had 1,300 animals sent to them, an increase of about 200 on the previous year. ""It's an increasing problem everywhere but London is difficult to re-home in as people in general don't have the space."" One option for people who want a pet but cannot guarantee long term support is fostering. Ms Eden said the centre has 80 foster carers who look after animals for any amount of time, with the minimum amount being a month. For the centre, this is great as it helps them to use that time to find the animal a permanent home and it frees up space for the constant influx of animals that are coming their way. ""With more coming at us, it gets harder every year to find homes with people willing to make long term commitment,"" says Ms Eden. ""It's a constant battle as we're the ones who take the old damaged ones which are difficult to re-home."" It is hoped that if the cat cafe goes ahead and is successful, more could open which may help keep more animals out of shelters.","Plans are afoot to open a cat cafe in London, but how difficult is it to own a pet in the city?"
"By Jane Onyanga-OmaraBBC News Bristol The avalanche of headlines and claims about Miss Yeates's landlord were later said to have been the result of a ""feeding frenzy"" among elements of the UK's media. The disappearance of the 25-year-old Bristol landscape architect on 17 December 2010 had attracted the focus of the media from early on. Six days after she was last seen, amid fears she had been abducted, Avon and Somerset Police held a press conference with her parents David and Teresa to appeal for information. Two days later, on Christmas Day, her snow-covered body was found on Longwood Lane, Failand, near Bristol. When Mr Jefferies was arrested on suspicion of her murder on 30 December, the appetite for information seemed insatiable. Admission to jurors Vincent Tabak - the man who would later emerge as Miss Yeates's killer - also saw it as an opportunity. The 33-year-old Dutch engineer gave police false information he hoped would pile more suspicion on Mr Jefferies. He later admitted trying to wrongly incriminate the retired English teacher, who lived in the flat above Miss Yeates and her boyfriend Greg Reardon in Canynge Road in Clifton. Tabak, who was Miss Yeates's next-door neighbour as well as Mr Jefferies' tenant, was arrested in January and later pleaded guilty to Miss Yeates's manslaughter but denied murder. At his trial at Bristol Crown Court, he admitted telling police Mr Jefferies' car had moved on the night of 17 December. ""I shouldn't have said that about Chris Jefferies,"" he told jurors. The court heard that Tabak and his girlfriend Tanja Morson had visited his family in the Netherlands during the festive period. They saw news coverage that Mr Jefferies had been arrested and Miss Morson called Avon and Somerset Police to say Tabak had some information that may be useful. Det Con Karen Thomas visited the pair at a hotel in the Netherlands, the court heard. Tabak said on the night that Miss Yeates died, Mr Jefferies' Volvo had been facing one way in the driveway and the next day it was facing the opposite way. ""The indication being that Mr Jefferies had moved his vehicle during the night,"" Det Con Thomas said. 'Substantial' damages Mr Jefferies was eventually released from police bail without charge. In the media he had been portrayed as an ""eccentric loner"" - and worse. After his release, Mr Jefferies accepted an apology and ""substantial"" libel damages from the Sun, Mirror, Sunday Mirror, Daily Mail, Daily Record, Daily Express, Daily Star and the Scotsman. Mr Jefferies' lawyer told the High Court hearing his client had taught English at the Bristol public school Clifton College for 34 years, and was of good character. In July, the Daily Mirror and the Sun were fined for being in contempt of court by the High Court over their reporting of the investigation. The Daily Mirror was fined Â£50,000 and the Sun Â£18,000. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, told the hearing that two articles in the Mirror had ""vilified"" Mr Jefferies. He said they had wrongly asserted he had been involved in unacceptable sexual behaviour and was linked both to paedophile offences and a 1974 murder. 'Witch-hunt' victim The Mirror said it was seeking leave to appeal. The court heard the Sun had conveyed the impression Mr Jefferies was ""a stalker, with an obsession with death"". Louis Charalambous, Mr Jefferies' lawyer, said: ""Christopher Jefferies is the latest victim of the regular witch-hunts and character assassinations conducted by the worst elements of the British tabloid media."" Mr Jefferies' legal team said he was also pursuing a civil case against the police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. Attorney General Dominic Grieve welcomed the contempt judgement, saying: ""These two newspapers completely lost the plot, they engaged in a feeding frenzy over the new year period."" He said it acted as ""a reminder to the press that the Contempt of Court Act applies from the time of arrest"". The act aims to prevent potential jurors from becoming influenced by press and broadcast reports.","When Christopher Jefferies was arrested on suspicion of murdering Joanna Yeates, every aspect of his life became the focus of the nation's media."
"A solicitor for the soldier, known as Soldier N, last week informed prosecutors in Northern Ireland of his death. Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Londonderry in 1972. A fourteenth person died later. In an email received by some of the Bloody Sunday relatives, which the BBC has seen, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said: ""We received word last week from Soldier N's solicitor that Soldier N had recently died. ""We don't have any reason to doubt the information we've been given but I had directed the police to get some formal proof of that (a death certificate) and was waiting on that before alerting the families. 'Justice' Kate Nash, whose 19-year-old brother, William, was killed on Bloody Sunday, told BBC News NI she was disappointed at the news of Soldier N's death. ""If you walked in our shoes, you would realise how important justice is, not just to us, but to everybody,"" said Ms Nash. ""My brother, by not receiving justice, is being treated as worthless, which he is not."" Eighteen ex-paratroopers have been reported to the PPS over the killings and the Bloody Sunday victims are currently waiting to hear if any will face charges. A decision over whether to charge soldiers is expected at the end of February. The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on individual cases. Investigation There have been a number of investigations into the events of Bloody Sunday, including the Widgery Tribunal - which was later described by some as a whitewash - and the Saville Inquiry, which in 2010 led to then Prime Minister David Cameron apologising to the Bloody Sunday families. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation after the Saville Report on the killings in 2010 said that those who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent. The BBC previously obtained a letter from a senior public prosecutor detailing the criminal charges the soldiers could face. They include murder and attempted murder, wounding, perjury and joint enterprise, which means an offence where two or more people are involved. The correspondence stated:",Prosecutors considering bringing charges against former paratroopers over Bloody Sunday have been told one of the soldiers has died.
"John Jones, a former detective with the Metropolitan Police, died at the age of 79 on 1 November after battling the disease for several years. The pair met when Currie interviewed him during her programme on BBC Radio 5 Live in 1999. Currie, 74, described him as a ""gallant gentleman"" with a ""wonderful sense of humour"". The former Conservative minister, from Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire, told BBC Radio Derby Mr Jones had attracted her attention during a discussion about gang violence in London. ""I just thought he sounded really interesting. He didn't sound like a police officer,"" she said. ""I said to my producer 'give him my number and if he's interested I'll take him to lunch in Covent Garden'."" 'Slightly naughty' Mr Jones, whose wife had died the previous year, agreed to the invitation. Mrs Currie said: ""I got there early and he turned up in a dark blue suit and a Flying Squad tie. I thought 'I wouldn't mind being arrested by you'."" The pair were married in 2001 and had remained together ever since, even appearing as a celebrity couple on an episode of Bargain Hunt. ""We were very lucky. We had 20 great years,"" Mrs Currie said. ""He was fun. He made everybody smile. He had a wonderful sense of humour, slightly naughty and very old fashioned but in a gallant gentleman kind of way."" 'Hearts and minds' Mr Jones died a few weeks after opting to bring his cancer treatment to an end. ""He'd had cancer for many years. He was a heavy smoker and inevitably most people who smoke get an illness and the worst of those is cancer,"" said Mrs Currie. ""He had three different bouts of three different cancers. Every time he came out of hospital he left bits behind. ""Eventually the cancer came back, as cancer does, and this time it was in his bones and his brain."" Mrs Currie also paid tribute to his distinguished policing career. ""He led remarkable teams and did a tremendous amount,"" she said.

"By Kevin SharkeyBBC News NI The events were organised by Amnesty International and Both Lives Matter. Amnesty campaigners have called for Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to decriminalise abortion in NI. Abortion is illegal in Northern Ireland unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland. As part of the Amnesty protest, 28 women marched to Parliament with suitcases, representing what the organisation said is: ""The number of women who fly from Northern Ireland for an abortion each week"". The campaigners, who included two actresses from the TV series Derry Girls - Siobhan McSweeney who plays Sister Michael and Nicola Coughlan who plays Clare - and a number of MPs representing seats in Great Britain, also presented a petition to the Northern Ireland Office. The petition, which has 62,000 signatures, called for abortion to be decriminalised in Northern Ireland. The Both Lives Matter campaigners called on the Northern Ireland secretary to ensure that Westminster ""respects devolution and does not impose an extreme abortion law on Northern Ireland"". Its protest included 10 women, each carrying a box which the group said contained: ""10,000 names symbolising the 100,000 people who are alive today because of Northern Ireland's abortion laws"". Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC) has called for the reform of ""termination of pregnancy"" laws in Northern Ireland. The commission has been in Geneva in Switzerland addressing the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. What happened when NI's abortion law was challenged in court? In June 2018 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal brought by the NIHRC. But a majority of judges said the existing law was incompatible with human rights law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and sexual crime. The commission lost on the issue of whether they had the required standing to bring the case, and analysts suggested the defeat came because of a technical legal point. The Supreme Court judges said it would have required the case to have been brought by a woman who was pregnant as a result of sexual crime or who was carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality. Judges from the Northern Ireland High Court are considering a challenge to the law from a woman whose case is based on her personal experience.",Opposing groups in the ongoing debate about abortion in Northern Ireland have staged simultaneous protests outside Parliament.
"The University of Wales Newport said its plan for a bigger institution could deliver ""what's necessary"" for Wales. The Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (Hefcw) has said the current 11 universities should be cut to six. It has called for Newport, the University of Glamorgan and Uwic in Cardiff to join forces. A Hefcw report in July said it should involve a new ""metropolitan"" university for south east Wales. Newport said its proposal was ""seeking to build"" on the Hefcw report. It follows Education Minister Leighton Andrews's challenge last year to universities to ""adapt or die"". Mr Andrews has said Welsh universities will only be permitted to charge increased tuition fees from September 2012, upon which their survival will depend, if they can demonstrate they intended to collaborate more closely. Since then, a number of Welsh universities have announced talks on possible moves to cooperate or merge. In making its case, Newport say it must protect the work it has done within the city and the Gwent valleys. Newport University vice-chancellor Dr Peter Noyes said: ""The future we're outlining through this consultation process is a new university for south east Wales. 'Huge contribution' ""It will have an impact upon international higher education and the international economy, but specifically in this document we are outlining the fact that there is a huge contribution from the University of Newport to its local community. ""Over Â£100m a year is invested in the local community as a result of the university being here, and it's that that we wish to protect and enhance and strengthen as a result of the new university coming into operation. ""The minister and the funding council have indicated that they would like a larger institution that can compete against the metropolitan institutions that exist across the border, and that's as almost as far as they've gone in respect of defining what sort of things this institution can do. ""In our document we think a bigger institution, with the strengths of which ever parties take part, could deliver what's necessary for the local community and Wales generally."" The university said it was one of Wales' most successful at ""opening up education to people from disadvantaged backgrounds"", and more than half of its 9,500 students come from the Gwent region. Pablo Riesco, president of Newport Student's Union said: ""Over the challenging times ahead, Newport Students' Union will be working to ensure that the interests of our students and their views are kept at the forefront of any negotiations."" The University of Glamorgan said it would not comment while a consultation period into the future of higher education was continuing. Uwic said it was drafting its own submission ahead of a 5 October deadline and was not in a position to comment at this stage. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""The [Hefcw] report sets out very clear recommendations for the future of the sector. ""We have published the report in full and are now seeking representations from stakeholders and the public on the council's recommendations. We welcome all views.""","A blueprint for a new super-university in south east Wales has been unveiled in response to a challenge to institutions to ""adapt or die""."
"Mark DevenportPolitical editor, Northern Ireland@markdevenporton Twitter Now Martin McGuinness has described Mr Paterson's speech announcing a consultation on creating a Stormont opposition as ""clumsy and ill-thought out"". The Northern Ireland Office has consistently made it clear it will only re-write the rules at Stormont with the consensus of the local parties. So Sinn Fein's response isn't a very good omen. No matter how many responses drop in to the NIO letterbox advocating a Westminster-style system at Stormont, the secretary of state will have to deal with a majority nationalist party which accuses him of wanting to ""re-write the Good Friday Agreement"". The independent unionist David McNarry this week called for a referendum to be held both on creating a ""voluntary coalition"" and cutting the number of Stormont MLAs to 80. But if Gerry Adams isn't going to get his way on a border poll anytime soon, then David McNarry is probably going to have to wait even longer for his referendum, no matter how populist his approach. Leadership contests In truth, two consultations of a kind have recently been held on the idea of creating a Stormont opposition. They were called the SDLP and Ulster Unionist leadership contests. The UUP's John McCallister was clear about his intention to walk unilaterally into opposition - but party activists opted instead for Mike Nesbitt, who wanted to remain within the Executive tent. During the SDLP leadership campaign Conall McDevitt was less explicit about replacing the mandatory coalition, but did talk about negotiating a new system of government. In the event, although the young South Belfast MLA polled well, he came in as runner up to Alasdair McDonnell who has shown little enthusiasm for dismantling the Good Friday Agreement's ""ugly scaffolding"". Whilst some may day dream about opposition, Wednesday's joint statement from the first and deputy first ministers is an example of the system, as Churchill might have phrased it, up with which we must put. 'Frenemies' By and large the two dominant parties in the mandatory coalition call the shots and the others then decide whether to like it or lump it. Within the five Stormont ""frenemies"", allegiances can change. At one point Alliance appeared the loyal coalition partner with the SDLP and UUP outside the tent . But January's decision by the DUP and Sinn Fein to sacrifice Alliance minister Stephen Farry turned the tables. Alliance's alienation from the big boys appeared compounded in May by their falling out over the still to be published new community relations strategy. Now the abolition of the Employment and Learning Department has been delayed could the shifting sands at Stormont reconfigure once again? It's hard to say. No wonder the voters get either confused or disinterested when elections are called. But if any politician at Stormont really wants change they would need to take unilateral action rather than wait for either the NIO consultation or some hypothetical referendum to change the rules of the game. PS: I'm away for the next two weeks - in my absence my colleague Martina Purdy will be blogging here from time to time.","Sinn Fein, it's fair to say, really doesn't like Owen Paterson. Previously Gerry Adams accused the Secretary of State of ""arrogance"" for not calling a border referendum."

In September 2017, the BBC's Panorama filmed detainees apparently being mistreated. Serco said it will increase staff numbers to improve the centres. The Home Office revealed the outsourcing giant had won the contract, despite it being fined Â£19m last year for overcharging the government to carry out electronic tagging - prompting an audit of its contracts. A spokesman for the government department said the contract - which will last until 2028 and could be extended to 2030 - was awarded after an ""open and rigorous procurement process"" and there are ""ambitious plans"" to improve the two centres.

"Former maternity risk manager Jeanette Parkinson was ""significantly overpaid"" when she left Morecambe Bay Hospitals Trust in 2012, it says. Ms Parkinson and other midwives were accused of colluding over evidence given to an inquiry into baby deaths. The deal has been highlighted in the Health Service Journal. Ms Parkinson was one of the midwives caring for newborn Joshua Titcombe, who died at Barrow's Furness General hospital in Cumbria in November 2008. He was one of 11 babies and one mother to die after being treated at the trust's hospitals over a nine-year period. A later inquiry led by Dr Bill Kirkup found that a ""lethal mix"" of failures at the trust led to their ""unnecessary"" deaths between 2004 and 2013. He said Ms Parkinson provided ""model answers"" to her colleagues ahead of an inquest hearing into Joshua's death, which led to a ""distortion of the process"". Now an internal review into her departure, ordered by chief executive Jackie Daniel, who joined the trust in August 2012, has revealed ""fundamental flaws"" in procedures and governance. No exact figures have been disclosed but the review states that under the terms of the deal, Ms Parkinson ""appears to have been significantly overpaid (by as much as 14 months)"". She also claimed 470 hours of overtime pay, which the review says ""was accepted without any challenge"". The agreement also said that as Ms Parkinson took early redundancy, the trust ""agreed not to commence an internal investigation into the employee's performance as maternity risk manager"". Ms Daniel said she was ""desperately disappointed"" that Ms Parkinson was not investigated by the trust at the time and has referred the matter to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) and the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The internal review concluded: ""What is clear is that if there were any tangible and evidence-based concerns about Jeanette Parkinson's performance and conduct in her role, these were never formally documented or looked into. ""There is no evidence of it [the deal] being approved or discussed through other internal governance processes."" The BBC was unable to contact Ms Parkinson, who is the subject of an ongoing NMC investigation, for comment.","A former midwife at a scandal-hit maternity unit received an ""irregular"" redundancy deal and a promise not to be investigated, a review has said."
"Oliver and Olivia remained the most popular baby names for the whole of the country, but Welsh names were not out of fashion everywhere.

"A paper in July outlining the sector's prospects in an independent Scotland claimed 34,000 jobs would be created. But Finance Secretary John Swinney said that figure should have referred to UK-wide and not Scottish jobs. The paper was amended three days after publication. Mr Swinney has now acknowledged the error in a written response to Conservative finance spokesman Gavin Brown. He said: ""This was a result of an incorrect interpretation of data presented by Lloyds Banking Group by Scottish government officials in the original published version of Maximising the Return from Oil and Gas in an Independent Scotland. ""The Scottish government report was subsequently updated on 26 July 2013 and it now states that: 'Lloyds Banking Group forecast in March 2013 that future growth in the sector will create 34,000 jobs in the industry and related businesses across the UK over the next two years, with all areas of Scotland expected to benefit'."" 'In black and white' Opposition parties have accused ministers of trying to pretend the figure applied to Scotland alone and then quietly issuing a correction. Mr Brown said: ""On many occasions the Scottish government has put its own unusual interpretation on figures and tried to paint it as reality. ""This time it used a UK figure and pretended it was a Scottish statistic, then blamed Lloyds for the mistake. ""However, it turns out the error was the Scottish government's and I'm glad that has now been clarified in black and white. ""It's also concerning to note the Scottish government doesn't appear to have an estimate of the number of jobs that will be created in the oil and gas industry in future years. ""Given the separation argument relies heavily on the sector, this leaves a substantial gap; something that has to be addressed as soon as possible."" Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""I am sure there are a few red faces in government offices just now. ""What is more concerning is the fact that it seems ministers tried to correct the record without letting anyone know what they were up to. ""This was a basic factual mistake that should have been acknowledged and corrected in the full glare of the public eye. Instead they tried to sneak out a correction without fanfare while parliament was in recess."" Lloyds briefing A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The projection of 34,000 new jobs was contained in a Lloyds briefing presented to the Scottish Parliament, which also indicated that all parts of Scotland are likely to benefit. ""The purpose of this section of our report was simply to highlight the substantial employment prospects for this thriving sector which is undoubtedly the case. ""Last month Lloyds confirmed that the projection was for across the UK. We made clear to media then that we would amend our paper to reflect that and reference it accordingly. She added: ""The North Sea sector plans to invest almost Â£100bn in future years, and the industry currently supports around 200,000 jobs in Scotland. ""With almost all oil production and more than half of gas production around these islands expected to take place in Scottish waters over the next three decades, clearly it will continue to create significant employment opportunities in Scotland for many years to come.""",Scottish ministers have acknowledged government officials incorrectly interpreted data on the number of jobs the oil and gas industry would create over the next two years.
"Caerphilly MP Wayne David is concerned a German firm will get the contract to replace Scimitar armoured cars. He called for a ""fair and open process"" with General Dynamics UK plants in south Wales allowed to bid. The Ministry of Defence has said announcements would be made by the end of the financial year, which is next Thursday. Reports suggest that the Boxer, which is manufactured by Munich-based ARTEC, could be the chosen supplier. In January, Wales' Economy Secretary Ken Skates urged the UK's Defence Procurement Minister Guto Bebb to consider the Piranha vehicle made by General Dynamics UK, which he said could supply suitable vehicles more cheaply and save Welsh jobs. Mr David, Labour's shadow minister for defence procurement, told the BBC that the American-owned firm - which has plants at Oakdale, in Caerphilly county, and at Merthyr Tydfil - was keen to bid. ""There should be a fair and open process,"" he said. ""Every company should have a chance to bid for a contract of this size."" The issue had been raised by Conservative MP Dr Julian Lewis during Business Questions in the Commons on Thursday. He asked for assurances that the decision would be announced in the Commons when Parliament is sitting and not during the Easter recess. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom said that it was an important point, but she could not answer the question at the moment. The Ministry of Defence pointed to a previous comment by Mr Bebb that announcements on the mechanised infantry vehicle programme would be made before the end of the financial year, which falls on Thursday, 5 April.","The process to award a Â£3bn deal for new military vehicles has been called ""clandestine"" by a Welsh MP."

"Several MPs who have criticised the leader have faced pressure from their constituency parties, and Mr Corbyn has recently been urged by one, Chuka Umunna, to ""call off the dogs"". Speaking to the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Corbyn said there would always be differences of opinion. Meanwhile a motion of censure against one MP has been withdrawn. Canterbury MP Rosie Duffield had been facing the action by her local party over her comments about Labour's anti-Semitism row, but this was later withdrawn at a branch meeting. A spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said it was ""not his place"" to get involved in the ""democratic practices of different parts of the Labour Party"". Last week Labour activists passed no-confidence votes against the Friends of Israel chairwoman Joan Ryan, Luton South MP Gavin Shuker and Nottingham East MP Chris Leslie. Earlier several Labour MPs rallied in support of Ms Duffield after the censure motion was revealed. Mr Corbyn told MPs on Monday night: ""The Labour Party has always been a broad church and I'm determined it remains so. ""We will always have some differences of opinion and we must protect the right of criticism and debate but our first and overwhelming priority is to deliver for the people we represent and remove this Conservative government from office. ""We must focus on that priority and turn our fire outwards."" On the confidence votes in local parties, a spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had told MPs that ""it is not his place to be involved in the democratic practices of different parts of the Labour Party"", the Press Association reported. He added: ""He was making the point that everybody is subject to democratic accountability. It's not his role to interfere with that. ""But obviously these things have to be conducted properly and thoroughly and without abuse and Jeremy reiterated... that our politics is conducted with respect and without abuse of any kind."" Shadow chancellor John McDonnell rejected claims Labour MPs who had criticised Mr Corbyn were being forced out of the party by far left activists. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm sorry, that does not bear relation to reality. ""We now have 500,000 members. It's a huge mass party now and, of course, those members want to get involved in discussions about policy. ""Also, they will reflect at times their view about the performances of their local MP. ""And we have had a small number of incidences that we have seen, two or three, where parties have come together and they have expressed concerns about the performance of their MP. That's happened right the way through the history of our party, but it's nothing untoward.""","Jeremy Corbyn says his party must ""turn our fire outwards"", promising MPs Labour will remain a ""broad church""."
"It was announced in January that Sure Start centres in Mickleover, Chaddesden, Oakwood, Chellaston, Derwent and Pear Tree could close. Derby City Council said it had found Â£500,000 to keep the centres open but the services offered could change. The Tory-Lib Dem council must cut Â£27m from its budget over two years. Evonne Williams, cabinet member for children and young people, said the council listened to what residents wanted. ""We listened to people in the consultation and took it all into account,"" she said. ""We need to make sure the same services are available across the city [in Sure Start centres] which will mean a decrease in services for some centres and an increase in others. ""We need to make sure it is equal across the city."" Ms Williams added in order to ensure the future of the centres, more long term funding would have to be established. ""We are trying to make sure there is no doubling up of services and find the money,"" she said.","Six children's centres in Derby have been saved from closure after the city council responded to a 13,000-signature petition against the proposal."
"They said they would take action if laws had been broken. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said a moratorium on EU meat imports, which some people have called for, was not allowed under EU rules. In France, six supermarket chains have withdrawn ready-meals from food groups Findus and Comigel. Earlier this week, Findus UK took its frozen beef lasagne, made by Comigel, off the shelves after some were found to have up to 100% horsemeat in them. Romania's president, Traian Basescu, said if false labelling had been carried out with the intention of making money that would discredit the country for a long time and raise the risk of export restrictions. Constantin Savu, a representative of Romania's National Food Safety Authority, said more than 25 abattoirs there were authorised not only to butcher horsemeat but also to export it within the EU. But he added: ""We cannot know what happens to it... after it exits the abattoir."" He said an investigation was under way to establish what had happened. Speaking about the growing scandal of horsemeat contamination, Mr Paterson said the British government was determined to ""get to the bottom of it"" and was working closely with other European governments. But he added: ""It looks as if the problem is limited to processed food and it looks as if there has been criminal substitution of beef with horse."" Findus France has said it will take action in the French courts, believing itself to be the victim of fraud. But the company that supplied the meat, Spanghero, based in southern France, has also said it was the victim of fraud - and intends to sue its Romanian supplier. In the latest developments: The French minister for consumer affairs, Benoit Hamon, said it appeared financial gain was the motive of the fraud and overall it could have netted the perpetrators Â£250,000. Horsemeat in France is not noticeably cheaper than beef, but according to the Green MEP Jose Bove the price of horsemeat has recently fallen dramatically in Romania following a new law there banning horses and carts on the highway. He said this could have opened tempting possibilities for cheating.",Romanian officials are investigating whether horsemeat found in beef products in Britain and France came from a Romanian abattoir.
"The international trade secretary will say he wants exports as a proportion of UK GDP to rise from 30% to 35%. Last year exports of goods and services rose to a record high of Â£620 billion. The Federation of Small Businesses praised the aspiration - but said more financial incentives, such as grants and ""export vouchers"", were needed. Mike Cherry from the FSB said small companies could use the vouchers to invest in things such as translation services or market research. The government's UK Export Finance department - which offers financial help to exporters - already has the capacity to support Â£50bn of exports. 'Full order books' Analysis by BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed Exports from the UK are at a record high - boosted by the weakness in the value of the pound and stronger global growth than expected. Yes, there are uncertainties around Brexit - and if there is ""no deal"" the economic effects could be dramatic and negative. But many businesses report full order books, as British companies that do export, particularly outside the EU, find plenty of willing customers. The government now says it wants to build on that success - admitting that although Britain does ""punch above its weight"" in export markets it also punches below its potential. Some 400,000 firms that could export goods and services have no international presence. In a speech setting out the government's export strategy, Mr Fox will say the UK should ""set its sights high"" as it leaves the EU. He is expected to tell a business audience in London that UK firms are ""superbly placed to capitalise on the rapid changes in the global economic environment"". Minister for trade and export promotion, Baroness Rona Fairhead, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she understood businesses wanted ""stability and certainty"" in the short term and there were concerns about establishing a trade deal with the EU. But she said the government also needed to focus on the long-term future of UK companies - and that was in exports. ""Research shows that businesses that export actually are healthier, make more profit, employ more people and in fact are more sustainable,"" she said. ""Our message to small family businesses is take the plunge, we will provide support to you because you are more likely have a flourishing business that you can pass on to your generations."" But shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said an export strategy couldn't be based on ""one-off arms sales"". ""After record trade deficit figures, staff cuts in trade promotion and delays to tradeshow funding for business, the government is finally publishing an export strategy - some two years after the trade department was established,"" he said. ""Our businesses need a strong future export relationship with the EU. The Tory export strategy has thus far been based on controversial one-off arms sales."" He said a Labour government would deliver a customs union with ""our most important trade partners"". Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI (Confederation of British Industry), said the strategy was ""a timely signal"" that the government was committed to improving the UK's competitiveness. ""The CBI strongly supports the ambition to make exports 35% of GDP, which will put the UK out in front of many of our international competitors,"" she said. ""We estimate that in every region of the country there are around 10% of businesses that could export, but don't, and we look forward to working alongside the government to support and inspire them to seize the opportunity.""","Britain can be a ""21st Century exporting superpower"", Liam Fox is expected to say in a speech detailing the government's post-Brexit ambitions."
"Fire crews were called to a farm near Bramham, Leeds, at about 14:00 GMT on Saturday after copper from the pedometer's batteries apparently reacted with the pig's excrement and dry bedding. The pedometers were being used on pigs to prove they were free-range. No pigs or people were hurt in the fire. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said it had gone to ""save the bacon"". In a Twitter post, the fire service said: ""Should be an oink not a tweet."" ""Cause of fire attributed to a battery-powered pedometer carried by one of the pigs (to prove it was free-range), which was eaten by the other.""

"The survey of 35,000 rank-and-file officers in England and Wales found that 70% said their ""personal morale"" was low, compared with 59% last year. The Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said it showed the ""parlous state"" of morale. The Home Office said policing was a stressful and demanding job but it was still an attractive career choice. The Police Federation's pay and morale survey also found: But 53% said they were willing to go the extra mile for the police and 78% said they could count on their colleagues for friendship and support when needed. Police Federation chairman Steve White said the findings should ""sound a warning"" to those in charge. ""Despite the extreme pressures the service is under, it is heartening that the majority of officers state they will still go the extra mile to protect the public from harm and that the police family is very much intact through the support officers provide each other,"" he added. Bryan, a serving police officer from London, contacted the BBC to say he would be quitting the force as soon as he could. ""I had planned to complete 30 years,"" he said. ""But due to low morale and the fact of pension changes, working conditions, unable to get time off and so on, I am leaving next month after 25 years service and reaching 55 years of age. ""This is my earliest opportunity to go. And trust me I'm going. Experienced officers are leaving in large numbers. New officers will treat this like any other job and leave after a short time."" 'Stressful and traumatic' The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), formerly the Association of Chief Police Officers, said working in the police service could be extremely rewarding but extremely difficult. Chief Constable Giles York, the NPCC's workforce lead, said it was ""not surprising"" morale was low among some workers amid budget cuts and because of the ""stressful and traumatic"" nature of the job. ""Our staff are doing a magnificent job and victim satisfaction and public confidence in policing are being maintained. Police leaders recognise the pressures for their staff and are committed to improving their welfare and well being,"" she said. Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said sickness and stress levels were higher than ever. He said: ""Sadly many of those who have devoted their life to protecting the public are now leaving in despair both because the police service is suffering the biggest cuts of any in Europe and because of the way that the police service has been treated by [Home Secretary] Theresa May."" Policing minister Mike Penning said: ""Officers will continue to retire earlier than most public servants and pensions will continue to be among the best available. ""These are just two of the reasons that voluntary resignations have remained at just 2% or less in recent years - far lower than other workforces in both the public and private sectors. ""This government has made it easier for the police to do their job by cutting red tape, scrapping unnecessary targets, and giving officers the discretion to use their professional judgement."" The survey ran from April to June and used the responses of more than 32,500 officers - or just over a quarter (28%) of federated officers.","Only one in 10 police officers would recommend the job to other people, a Police Federation survey suggests."

Poole's strategic director Jim Bright said: ""After an initial inspection last week revealed an issue with a small section of the road surfacing, the bridge was left raised all night on both Saturday and Sunday.

"It has drawn attention to what it said was a culture of complacency in many schools. The commission has blamed government and inspectors for their approach to schools. Education Secretary Mike Russell has responded that schools are already benefiting from new freedoms. And teachers' leaders said they were shocked by the description, which did not take into account exceptional efforts by staff in individual schools. The commission, which was launched in November, is headed by Keir Bloomer - one of the architects of the curriculum for excellence and a former leader of the education directors in Scotland's local authorities. Ross Martin, an advisor to the commission, said it would benefit pupils if schools were encouraged to do what they thought would best meet the needs of children in their catchment area. ""The key aspect for the commission is to identify where innovation is already happening,"" he said. 'Hard work' Mr Martin said they wanted to find out ""where we've moved away from that old template mentality of the bog standard comprehensive"". He said it was a misconception that Scottish schools had not innovated, and cited Govan High in Glasgow as one example. The school has been offering pupils more chances to take vocational courses, which had seen above average numbers securing jobs after they left school. Much of the commission's criticism has been rejected by the education secretary. He said: ""I don't think we have bog standard schools in Scotland. ""We have some schools that aren't performing as well as they should and aren't ambitious enough. ""But Curriculum for Excellence has made an enormous difference to Scotland's schools and we have very good teachers, very good head teachers, very good schools that are delivering lots of different things."" Ann Ballinger, general secretary of the Scottish Secondary Schools Association, said she did not recognise the description of ""bog standard schools"". ""I find it shocking that anyone can make this kind of comment about all of the schools in Scotland without having the evidence to support it, without taking into account the enormous hard work that people across the country do to educate our young,"" she said. ""I don't just mean teachers there. I mean support staff and parents. ""We all work exceptionally hard to improve the education of our young people and the last thing we need is someone sniping from the sidelines.","The Commission on School Reform has urged Scottish schools to abandon what it called the ""bog standard"" model of comprehensive education."

A spokesman said the MoD had not yet decided whether to deploy ground based air defence systems during the event. But estate resident Brian Whelan said firing the missiles ""would shower debris across the east end of London"". The journalist said: ""At first I thought it was a hoax. I can't see what purpose high-velocity missiles could serve over a crowded area like Tower Hamlets. ""They say they'll only use them as a last resort, but... you'd shower debris across the east end of London by firing these missiles."" Mr Whelan, who claims to have seen soldiers carrying a crate into the building, said his property management company put up posters and gave out the leaflets on Saturday. He continued: ""They are going to have a test run next week, putting high velocity missiles on the roof just above our apartment and on the back of it they're stationing police and military in the tower of the building for two months.

The document added that if the government decides to use the missiles during the Games, the soldiers could be ""operationally deployed for a period of up to two months this summer"". The weapon being considered is a High Velocity Missile (HVM) system, which would be based on the Lexington Building Water Tower. The tower contains residential flats. 'Excellent view' The MoD says in the leaflet that the missiles will not pose a hazard to residents and ""will only be authorised for active use following specific orders from the highest levels of government in response to a confirmed and extreme security threat"". The document states: ""Having a 24/7 Armed Forces and police presence will improve your local security and will not make you a target for terrorists. ""The location has been chosen as it is situated close to the Olympic Park and offers an excellent view of the surrounding area and the entire sky above the Olympic Park. ""The top of the tower also offers a flat, uncluttered and safe area from which to operate."" The Army website says the HVM system is ""designed to counter threats from very high performance, low-flying aircraft"". It says the missile travels at more than three times the speed of sound, using ""a system of three dart-like projectiles to allow multiple hits on the target"". The missiles can be fired from the shoulder, from a lightweight multiple launcher or from armoured vehicles. A MoD spokesman said: ""As announced before Christmas, ground based air defence systems could be deployed as part of a multi-layered air security plan for the Olympics, including fast jets and helicopters, which will protect the skies over London during the Games.

The Canal and River Trust installed the buoy to remind people to ""take extra care"" in the area. Rebecca Whitehouse, from the trust, said there had been ""a few incidents last year with people falling into the Basin"". One such incident was Steve Worthington and his son who fell in on 4 October 2019, blaming ""poor light"". Two cars are also known to have driven into the water by mistake. One of the problems is thought to have been a build-up of thick weed on the surface of the canal, leading people to mistake the water for grass or asphalt and therefore safe to step on. A major clean-up operation followed last year in which more than 60 tonnes of weed was removed from the Basin. The 1.8m (6ft) high buoy was installed in the Basin, which is home to a number of bars and restaurants in Walsall town centre, in November and the Canal and River Trust is applying for it to stay in place for five years.

"Funding has been given to developers who want to build the proposed racetrack on a site near Ebbw Vale. The Wales Audit Office (WAO) said in April there were ""significant shortcomings"" in the way the government handed over the money. But James Price defended the amount of public money put into the scheme. The benefit for the economy meant it could be a ""very high-impact output project"", but it also carried ""significant potential risk"", the official in charge of the Welsh Government's economy department said. He did not accept there were ""shortcomings"" in his department, but added: ""I will accept that we have learned lessons."" He was giving evidence to the assembly's public accounts committee on Monday afternoon - the day before ministers will decide whether to give the circuit a Â£210m guarantee. Deputy Permanent Secretary Mr Price said Â£55m had been spent on developing the plans, most of which had come from the private sector and Â£9.2m of which was grants and loans from the Welsh Government. ""Having gone through all of the files, spoken to all of the people concerned in some depth, I am persuaded that we have achieved value for money for what we have got, which is a project which is ready - subject to finance - to be delivered,"" he said. The WAO also raised concerns about why the company was allowed to use a property development grant to buy a motorcycle engineering company in Buckinghamshire. The company, called FTR, has since folded. Mr Price could not confirm whether the minister in charge at the time, Edwina Hart, knew whether the grant was being used to buy the company, saying there was ""no paperwork trail"" to show she was aware. On Tuesday the cabinet will discuss whether to underwrite around half the Â£425m cost of the Circuit of Wales. It follows scrutiny of the business case as part of a due diligence process ordered by Economy Secretary Ken Skates. There have been repeated delays to the scheme since it was first proposed in 2011, with previous proposals for government guarantees being rejected.","More than Â£9m spent by the Welsh Government on plans for the Circuit of Wales was good value for money, a senior civil servant has told AMs."

No new runways are being contemplated either at Gatwick or Stansted, a stance criticised by airline bosses. Speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce's annual conference in London, Mr Walsh - chief executive of the International Airlines Group which owns British Airways - said the UK was failing ""to keep pace"" with Asian and Latin American in investment in transport infrastructure. Referring to the fact that the UK was only 10th in the table of the world's most competitive economies, he said the UK was the equivalent of a mid-table Premier League football club such as Fulham - whose goal was to avoid relegation rather than aspire to be top of the table. 'Dismal situation' He told the conference that China had built 42 airports in the last decade and planned to add a further 55 in the next eight years - at a time when the UK had ruled out additional capacity in the south of England. The UK's aviation policy was in ""unholy mess"" and politicians had ""made a dismal situation worse"" by a lack of leadership. Heathrow was ""full"" and he derided the government's ideas for increasing capacity, claiming a proposed rail link between Heathrow and Gatwick was ""absurd"" and a possible new airport in the Thames Estuary - to the east of London - was ""an idea whose time never seems to come"". ""Let me absolutely blunt,"" he said. ""You cannot make a business case to even start considering the development of a hub airport unless, at the beginning, you say you are going to force the closure of Heathrow."" He also criticised increases in air passenger duty in past Budgets, which he said had cost up to 25,000 jobs and deterred business investment and tourism in the UK. ""The absence of a grander plan might not be so destructive if, as a country, we lived up to the compliments we pay ourselves in the growth plans that we publish. But we don't do that either. ""Their (the coalition) idea of improving competitiveness is to raise taxes to a level which goes way beyond anywhere else in the world. We are choking off jobs in tourism-related industries as well as cutting off employment in airlines, airports and a very long supply chain."" 'No magic wand' Airlines did not want ""special treatment"", he insisted but ""clarity about how this country will earn its living in the future"". Mr Walsh's criticism, applauded by other business leaders at the event, comes a week ahead of the Chancellor George Osborne's Budget. The government says they will launch a consultation on their aviation strategy - including on the feasibility of the Thames Estuary proposal - shortly and ministers say they are determined to use existing capacity more effectively. Ministers are also committed to building a high-speed rail link between London and Birmingham, costing up to Â£17bn, and hope to extend it eventually to Manchester and Leeds. Speaking at Thursday's conference, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said the government had cut corporation tax and simplified the planning system among measures to boost growth. The UK's economic recovery would be ""choppy"" and there was no ""magic wand"" to bring that about more quickly, he said. While there had been signs of an improvement in business confidence in recent times, the government ""must do everything we can to try and lock in this shift in mood"".","One of the UK's top businessmen has attacked the government's growth and transport policies, saying they ""lack ambition"" and are costing jobs."
"Paul Lightowler, 60, died nine days after being hit by Richard Eveleigh, 63, after they watched Liverpool's Europa League final defeat on 18 May. Mr Lightowler's family had urged the judge at Liverpool Crown Court not to send Eveleigh, who admitted manslaughter, to prison. However, Judge Clement Goldstone QC sentenced him to 28 months in prison. 'Extremely close' The court heard the two Liverpool fans had watched the match at Liverpool Echo Arena together and were walking along Gradwell Street in the city centre when they fell out. The Crown Prosecution Service said CCTV showed Eveleigh of Woodlands Drive, Barnston, Wirral, punch his friend, who fell and cracked the back of his head on the road, knocking him unconscious. He never regained consciousness. Eveleigh told police he was ""mortified"" when he realised what he had done as he had not meant to hurt him. The court heard the pair were best friends and their families, who sat together for the sentencing, ""remain extremely close"". Eveleigh described how he had been treated with ""great kindness"" by Mr Lightowler's relatives. 'Magnanimity' The victim's sister Clare Bowe wrote a letter to the judge, pleading with him not to jail Eveleigh and said her family considers his death an accident. Judge Goldstone said the ""magnanimity"" of her family ""was something he has never experienced before"". He said Eveleigh was ""no doubt devastated"" but added ""whilst it's a grievous loss - it's a loss for which you bear entire responsibility"". He told Eveleigh he will have to serve half the sentence in custody.","A man has been jailed for killing his best friend of 45 years with a single punch in a ""silly"" row."
"By Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent, BBC News That's the broadly agreed view amongst the 49 member unions - but not the unanimous view. The leadership of the rail union, the RMT, oppose a new vote. On the other side, there is a vanguard pushing for a referendum on the final Brussels deal no matter what. This includes the GMB and the smaller Community and TSSA unions. So away from public view the shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer spent his Sunday in what are, these days, smoke-free rooms sounding out what the big unions will do in two weeks' time at Labour's conference. His mission is to try to find consensus and avoid conflict before all eyes turn to the Conservative conference a week later. So he wanted to find out if the largest union backing a 'people's vote' - the GMB - would press for Labour to adopt the same policy. I understand he was told they will. Currently the Labour leadership insist they would prefer to call for an election if Parliament either rejects Theresa May's final deal, or if she returns from Brussels empty-handed. A referendum, though, wouldn't be off the table as an option. Not just some unions, but many rank-and-file Labour members want their leadership to go further. So I'm told Sir Keir is trying to find ""a form of words"" to paper over any underlying differences before the party gathers in Liverpool. And Frances O'Grady's language at the TUC conference could provide the blueprint. In words and phrases that could only really be written by a committee, the TUC - including the big Labour supporting unions Unison and Unite - will formally agree a motion on the conference floor today backing ""the possibility of a campaign for people to have a final say on the final Brexit deal through a popular vote"". But more robustly, the TUC's general secretary adds that if this were to happen, then unions' ""full weight"" would be behind that campaign. And it is felt that if the Labour leadership could sound more enthusiastic about the prospect - rather than appearing to be being dragged reluctantly towards it - that might just be enough to keep the Remainers in Labour's ranks from publicly revolting. Unite's Len McCluskey - whose position is close to Jeremy Corbyn's - is stressing a new vote should be left ""on the table"". For Kremlinologists, that's more positive than the previous formulation of ""not taking it off the table"". But one thing is clear - the Labour leadership won't agree to back a new vote in all circumstances. If their language does become more positive, caveats will remain - and any support for a new referendum would only be triggered if Parliament can't agree a deal with Brussels.","In the glare of publicity, the TUC's Frances O'Grady announced that the unions would - under certain circumstances - back a referendum on a final Brexit deal."
"The 16-year-old victim was stabbed in the abdomen during a fight between two groups in Verulamium Park on 15 June. The defendants, who were arrested last week, are due at St Albans youth court on Wednesday. A third boy, 14, arrested in June, will appear at the city's Crown Court on Friday charged with attempted murder. He has also been charged with possession of a bladed article. The injured boy is now recovering at home, Hertfordshire Police confirmed.","Two boys, aged 15 and 16, have been charged with grievous bodily harm after an attack in St Albans in which a teenager was stabbed."
"The prime minister told a No 10 briefing the UK was at a ""critical moment"" and the rising number of cases and deaths shows ""why our plan is so essential"". He said he would ""not hesitate"" to impose further restrictions if needed. Chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: ""We don't have this under control at the moment."" ""There's no cause for complacency here at all,"" he added. It comes as the latest UK coronavirus figures showed there have been a further 7,108 cases and another 71 deaths. Last week, Mr Johnson introduced restrictions including a 10pm closing time for pubs, bars and restaurants in England, with similar announcements in Scotland and Wales, and a 15-person limit on weddings. Since then, further local lockdowns have come into force, including in north-east England, where households are banned from mixing indoors. At the press conference at Downing Street, Mr Johnson also said the nation could face the winter ""with confidence"" because it was now better prepared than in March. The preparations include being on track for 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, 2,000 beds in seven Nightingale hospitals and a four-month supply of protective equipment (PPE) such as masks, gowns and visors. He said they had trebled the number of ventilators in the NHS to 31,500 in the last six months. There were 312 Covid-19 patients in mechanical ventilator beds as of Tuesday, the government said, and 2,252 in hospital, as reported on Monday. 'Will the second wave be less severe?' It is now clear the second wave is here. Infections, hospital cases and deaths are all rising. But what happens next is the big unknown. The doomsday scenario of a doubling of cases every week that was put forward last week is not materialising. The increase in hospital admissions is even more gradual - and the total numbers being admitted are more than 10 times lower than they were at the peak. It points to a slower, less severe wave this time round. But it is still early days. We are just at the start of the autumn and winter period when respiratory viruses circulate more. The situation could easily unravel. However, the UK, like other countries, is in a much stronger position than we were when we walked blind into the first wave. Better treatments are in place, social distancing has become routine and - despite the problems - there is much more testing available. The odds are certainly stacked in our favour more than they were six months ago. Read the full analysis Mr Johnson also thanked ""everyone for the fantastic national effort that we are seeing"". ""No matter how impatient we may be, how fed up we may become, there is only one way of doing this, and that's by showing a collective forbearance, common sense and willingness to make sacrifices for the safety of others,"" he said. Mr Johnson paid particular tribute to university students, hundreds of whom have been forced to self-isolate, and are ""experiencing a first term back at university unlike anything they could have imagined"". Plans were being put in place to allow students home safely for Christmas, the prime minister promised. He urged people to use the NHS Test and Trace app, saying it had reached 14 million downloads. He also said he would resume providing regular Downing Street briefings. 'A long winter ahead' The prime minister warned he was prepared to take ""more costly"" action against the virus if necessary. ""If we put in the work together now, then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures,"" he said. England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty told the press conference that the number of Covid-19 patients was rising, especially in hotspots, although they remained lower than in early April. In London, the north-east and north-west of England there was a ""significant uptick"" in the number of people admitted to intensive care, he said. ""We are pointing out that the direction of travel for both hospitals and intensive care is going in the wrong direction, particularly in these areas that have seen rapid increases in cases,"" he said. ""We have got a long winter ahead of us."" Prof Whitty said the pattern of cases was ""rather different"" in the second wave, with a ""heavy concentration"" of infections in areas such as the the Midlands, as well north-east and north-west England, alongside the general rise in Covid-19. He said cases were increasing ""quite rapidly"" among older teenagers and under-21s, but the rate of transmission among school-age children was not changing very much. The government has faced criticism in recent days over the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of its coronavirus measures and the complexity of the changing rules. 'Urgent review' Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there had to be ""a national effort to prevent a second lockdown"". But he said the government was not fulfilling its role of providing a ""very clear strategy"", instead offering ""confusion"". Sir Keir said there needed to be an ""urgent review"" of local restrictions, as they had now been imposed in 48 areas and only lifted in one - Luton. A third of the UK population will be affected by some form of local coronavirus rules when new measures come into effect in four more local council areas in Wales on Thursday. The prime minister, who on Tuesday apologised for misstating the rules in the North East, admitted there could be complexities but defended the local approach. ""The best thing I can tell you is that everybody in the North East or elsewhere, in Merseyside, the Midlands, everywhere there are local restrictions, get on the websites, look at precisely what you're supposed to do,"" he said.","New measures to tackle the increase in coronavirus cases ""will take time to feed through"", Boris Johnson says."
"Carl Thorpe, 46, was discovered dead in his room at the Highgate Mental Health Centre in north London last year. The Old Bailey heard his killer, Jordan Bramble, was supposed to have been kept under constant watch in the unit. The jury found that the 22-year-old, who was unfit to stand trial, had carried out the attack. The defendant is at Broadmoor Hospital and Judge John Hillen QC said he faced being detained under the Mental Health Act for an unlimited amount of time. The jury heard Mr Thorpe suffered from schizophrenia and had been admitted to the mental health centre on 1 February last year. He was found dead two days later after staff were alerted to smoke and flames in his room. The court heard the 46-year-old had suffered injuries to his face and head and a ""forceful prolonged compression of the neck"". ""Efforts had also been made to burn parts of his body"", the prosecution said. CCTV footage from the morning of the killing showed Bramble, who has paranoid schizophrenia, pushing Mr Thorpe into the room and following him inside. The 22-year-old later confessed to the killing saying he did not like Mr Thorpe because he was gay. Bramble had spent three years in mental health units from 2014 to August 2018 and during that time had broken the nose of a staff member and punched a sleeping patient, the court heard. Prosecutor Julian Evans said a member of the unit's nursing team was supposed to have had him in sight at all times, but ""that level of observation simply did not happen"". He added that Mr Thorpe was a ""vulnerable"" man who had been ""very badly let down"". Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust told the BBC a ""comprehensive disciplinary investigation"" had been carried out following the death, ""which resulted in two nurses and two healthcare assistants being dismissed"". ""This was an isolated incident of completely unacceptable failures in professional practice and conduct and we are deeply sorry that we did not provide a safe and protective environment to these vulnerable patients in our care,"" they said.

"By Chris MorrisReality Check correspondent, BBC News It's a long read - 585 pages long - and we've just had a first look at the text. There will be plenty more to say in the days ahead. But what's in this draft document, that some people thought might never materialise? Well we've known about a lot of the content for some time. There are details of the financial settlement (often dubbed the divorce bill) that the two sides agreed some months ago: over time, it means the UK will pay at least Â£39bn to the EU to cover all its financial obligations. There's also a long section on citizens' rights after Brexit for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in Europe. It maintains their existing residency rights, but big questions remain about a host of issues, including the rights of UK citizens to work across borders elsewhere in the EU. Transition period The legal basis for a transition (or implementation) period, beginning after Brexit. It would be 21 months during which the UK would continue to follow all European Union rules (in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term change). That means that during transition, the UK would remain under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (in fact, the ECJ is mentioned more than 60 times in this document). The document says that decisions adopted by European Union institutions during this period ""shall be binding on and in the United Kingdom"". The transition period is also designed to allow time for the UK and the EU to reach a trade deal. The draft agreement says both sides will use their ""best endeavours"" to ensure that a long term trade deal is in place by the end of 2020. Significantly, if more time is needed, the option of extending the transition appears in the document (although, it makes it clear that the UK would have to pay for it). The document doesn't say how long the transition could be extended for (in fact they've left the date blank), only that the Joint Committee may take a decision ""extending the transition period up to [31 December 20XX]."" UK officials hope that the date will be clarified by the time of the proposed EU summit on 25 November. Northern Ireland If there was no long term trade agreement and no extension of the transition, that's when the so-called ""backstop"" would kick in. It's the issue that has dominated negotiations for the last few weeks and months: how to ensure that no hard border (with checks or physical infrastructure) emerges after Brexit between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Both sides agreed back in December 2017 that there should be a guarantee to avoid a hard border under all circumstances. That guarantee came to be known as the backstop, but agreeing a legal text proved very difficult. So what exactly does this draft agreement say about the border, the backstop and the legal guarantees that underpin it? If a backstop is needed, it will - as expected - take the form of a temporary customs union encompassing not just Northern Ireland but the whole of the UK. The draft agreement describes this as a ""single customs territory"". Northern Ireland, though, will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than Great Britain, and even more closely tied to the rules of the EU single market. Fishing One policy area is excluded from these potential customs arrangements: fishing. That's because the trade-off between access for UK fish produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK waters, is too controversial. The draft agreement simply states that ""the Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify"" an agreement ""on access to waters and fishing opportunities"". The way out? There are also details of one of the last issues to be negotiated - the terms on which the UK may be able to leave this temporary customs arrangement in the future. If either party notifies the other that it wants the backstop to come to an end, a joint ministerial committee will meet within six months to consider the details. But the backstop (which is part of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland) would only cease to apply if ""the Union and the United Kingdom decide jointly"" that it is no longer necessary. In other words, the UK will not have a unilateral right to bring those arrangements to an end. For some Brexiteers, that is simply unacceptable. But, don't forget, other countries will also have their concerns. They too will focus on the language surrounding a temporary customs union, to ensure that nothing is hidden there which could, in their view, give the UK rights without responsibilities; and - potentially - a competitive advantage. The EU insists the draft agreement ""includes the corresponding level playing field commitments and appropriate enforcement mechanisms to ensure fair competition between the EU27 and the UK."" So, it's not just in London that this document will be closely scrutinised. Finally one big question: to what extent could these temporary customs arrangements form the basis for a permanent future relationship, which can only be negotiated formally after Brexit has actually happened?",The draft withdrawal agreement is all about how the UK leaves the European Union. It's not about any permanent future relationship.
"Prince Harry and Meghan were greeted by High Commissioner Sir Jerry Mateparae before laying flowers and signing a book of condolence. They wrote ""we are with you"" before signing off with the Maori word ""arohanui"", which means ""much love"". Fifty people died in shootings at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday. The duke and duchess were among the first people to sign the book of condolence, which the High Commission says will be open for visitors to sign until 17:30 GMT on Thursday. Sir Jerry welcomed the couple with a traditional Maori welcome, called a Hongi, in which participants press their faces together. The couple added their bouquets of flowers to those left by members of the public outside the building. Meghan wore a pair of earrings given to her by New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, when she and Harry visited the country on their first official tour as a married couple last year. Prince Harry also visited Christchurch in 2015 when he was told about the city's efforts to regenerate after an earthquake which struck the city in 2011. Asked about his connection to Christchurch, Harry said: ""It's just very sad."" Meghan added she had been left ""devastated"" by the shootings. Sir Jerry said it was ""wonderful"" to host the royal guests. He added: ""We are overwhelmed by the tremendous amount of support we've received from across the UK."" Following last Friday's shootings, the royal couple issued a joint message with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in which they called the attack ""senseless"", saying: ""No person should ever have to fear attending a sacred place of worship."" They ended the message with the Maori words ""Kia Kaha"", meaning ""stay strong"". The Queen paid tribute to the emergency services and volunteers who helped the injured, saying: ""Prince Philip and I send our condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives."" She added her ""thoughts and prayers"" were with ""all New Zealanders"" at this ""tragic time"".

"The Prints for the Proclamation portfolio was produced in 1977 by Cardiff artists to mark the festival being held in the city a year later. Each of the 25 artists produced 35 original prints. A three day exhibition of the screen-prints, lithographs and etchings is being held at BayArt gallery, Bute Street, from Tuesday. The possibility of the collection still being in existence was first suggested by solicitor Neil Confrey who contacted the National Eisteddfod having bought two other prints in a Cardiff gallery in the mid-1990s. It appears that some point during the 1980s unsold prints from an original exhibition to raise funds for the Cardiff event were in the care of the Welsh Arts Council and transferred to the National Eisteddfod. After much rummaging, a large wooden box was found gathering dust in the Eisteddfod's Cardiff office. It contained various prints by the artists. The idea of a new exhibition came last year from Mr Confrey who contacted the office. The prints on show will also be sold to raise funds towards the visual arts section of the Carmarthenshire 2014 National Eisteddfod. Glyn Jones, who is behind Prints for the Proclamation said the original venture had two aims. He said: ""Firstly to try to raise cash to increase the prize money and so attract more artists to enter the Eisteddfod art competition. ""Secondly to introduce into the pre-festival publicity a marker which proclaimed that this Eisteddfod was going to reflect a broader contemporary art scene and hence attract more artists to exhibit."" Since producing the prints, two of the participants, Paul Brewer and Phil Nicol, went on to win the National Eisteddfod's gold medal for Fine Art. Two others - Terry Setch and Chris Orr - are now members of the Royal Academy in London. Writer Jo Mazelis who has an essay accompanying the prints in the exhibition said: ""They were produced at an important time for the Eisteddfod, and for visual art in Wales, and they are an important record of that time, contradictory, diverse and evolutionary as it was. As it still is.""","Eisteddfod artworks that have been ""lost"" for nearly 40 years are going back on show at an exhibition."

"NHS Highland said Portree Community Hospital and Dr Mackinnon Memorial Hospital in Broadford will fail to meet modern standards in the near future. A steering group, involving GPs, councillors, ambulance service and members of the public, is exploring options for a new hospital. Any detailed plans would be subject to public consultation. Highland councillor Hamish Fraser said Skye had previously missed out on chances of healthcare improvements. He said: ""I fear we have lost out on opportunities in the past because we could not agree locally on the need for change, but things do need to change and of that I am quite clear. ""This is not only a huge opportunity for Skye, Lochalsh and South West Ross, but also a big responsibility in consolidating and possibly enhancing the clinical and health services we have at present in this locality.""",A new hospital could be built on Skye to replace the island's two existing hospitals.
"Mr Hague said he did not know where the Libyan leader was, but he had been ""clearly rejected"" by his own people. While opposition forces control large parts of Tripoli, there are reports of gun battles with regime loyalists. The UK and France have invited Libya's opposition political authority to an international conference next week. Britain is also talking to humanitarian agencies about how to get emergency medical supplies into Tripoli. Aid groups have warned that the city's hospitals and medical centres have been ""overwhelmed with casualties"" and that medicine and fuel supplies are running low. The United Nations' envoy in Tripoli has said that opposition forces now control the vast majority of the capital, but there are reports of pockets of resistance from pro-Gaddafi forces. Rebel forces say they expect to detain Col Gaddafi soon, but he has urged forces loyal to him to continue fighting to ""cleanse the city"". After chairing a meeting of the National Security Council meeting - the third to be held in consecutive days over Libya - Mr Hague urged Col Gaddafi to stop making ""delusional statements"". Battle for Tripoli He said Col Gaddafi should accept the fact that he had ""lost control"" of most of Tripoli and large parts of Libya and would not be able to regain it. ""There is a clear, fundamental, decisive rejection of that regime by the people of Libya,"" he said. ""He [Col Gaddafi] should be telling his dwindling and remaining forces now to stand down."" He said the government remained ""actively engaged"" in both military and humanitarian efforts in Libya as well as United Nations moves to unfreeze Â£12bn Libyan assets in the UK held withheld since the conflict began. Downing Street said David Cameron and French President Nicolas Sarkozy had invited Libya's National Transitional Council (NTC) to attend a conference on the country's future in Paris next week. ""This will be an opportunity for the NTC to set out how the international community can help them on the path to establishing a free, democratic and inclusive Libya and for all those who wish to support Libya to discuss the role that they can play to support this,"" a Number 10 spokesman said. British nationals As fighting continued in Tripoli, BBC journalists confined for days in a Tripoli hotel by armed guards loyal to the Gaddafi regime were released after representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross arranged for them to leave. Those freed from the Hotel Rixos also included a US congressman and an Indian MP. But amid concerns for the safety of the small number of British nationals still in Tripoli, it emerged that a Maltese vessel which the Foreign Office suggested that Britons could use to leave the capital had not reached its intended destination, instead returning to Malta. The Maltese authorities said it was not considered ""safe enough"" to transfer passengers from the city centre to the port. The UK government has advised all Britons still in Libya to leave the country immediately. Security experts said they expected there to be continued attacks from remnants of the regime over the coming days and weeks amid fears of reprisals should pro-Gaddafi forces lay down their arms. 'Significant challenges' For Labour, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said it was clear the days of Gaddafi rule were over and that he was ""on the run"". But he said there was a lot of work to be done to bring stability to the country, to disarm combatants and to ensure the Libyan people could get access to basic amenities. ""Taking a city is not the same as running a city,"" he told the BBC. ""The National Transitional Council faces an important and significant challenge in translating a popular uprising into stable government for Libya."" Mr Alexander said the UK could play a role in supporting what he said must be a Libyan-led process in developing new constitutional arrangements for the country. Military operations Nato has said its military operations will continue until all pro-Gaddafi forces surrender. The UK has taken a lead role in five months of strikes against the apparatus of the Gaddafi regime, in accordance with a UN mandate to protect Libyan civilians. The UK has also been providing logistical advice and training to the anti-Gaddafi forces but has effectively ruled out sending in ground troops as part of a transition to a new government. The only Conservative MP to vote against military intervention in Libya has continued to question the motives behind the campaign. John Baron described the action as the ""longest assassination attempt in history"" and said he remained concerned that successors to the Gaddafi regime might not prove committed to democracy.","Foreign Secretary William Hague has urged Col Muammar Gaddafi to tell his supporters to stop fighting, saying their numbers are ""dwindling""."
"The pair became stuck at 14:00 GMT on Friday on the B4931 near Bala in Gwynedd. They were eventually reached by a search and rescue team at 08:00 GMT on Saturday before a challenging walk to safety. Rescuers said the pair had been following sat-nav instructions and warned motorists to use ""common sense"". The two motorists had become stuck on the remote and narrow moorland road at the southern end of the Berwyn range. An attempt to reach the motorists by 4x4 had failed because of extensive drifting on parts of the road. Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team were alerted to the incident early on Saturday and decided walking the motorists off the hill in the dark would be more hazardous than leaving them in their car. The volunteers from the team set out at 04:30 GMT in what were described as ""very testing driving conditions"", with the aim of reaching the pair after dawn. The rescue party made its way as far as possible up the closed road before proceeding on foot. Widespread disruption Conditions on the moor were said to be extremely difficult with high winds creating drifts above head height and engulfing the entire road. The stranded car was located at around 08:00 GMT. The pair were provided with clothing to walk off the moorland before arriving in Bala by about 10:30 GMT. ""It is another reminder of the need to apply some common sense when following sat-nav instructions in a rural and mountainous area such as ours, especially with the prevailing weather conditions,"" said Aberdyfi Search and Rescue Team member Graham O'Hanlon. ""Fortunately, these people were well enough prepared to sit out their ordeal in a degree of comfort, but it will be some days if not weeks before they see their car again."" Snowfall on Friday and Saturday caused widespread disruption to roads and rail travel in parts of north Wales. Emergency services said many roads were treacherous and people should only travel only if necessary. North Wales Police who were called out to help stranded motorists in some cases found themselves in difficulties coping with the conditions.",A couple were trapped in their car in a snow drift for 18 hours before being led to safety by rescuers.
"By Chris WoodBBC News For Mogdad Abdeen, from Khartoum in Sudan, his visit to the Maes in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, is confirmation a life snatched away from him can finally begin again in a new country. He was among 24 refugees and asylum seekers from countries such as Pakistan and Iraq brought to the event by Oxfam Cymru to give them a taste of Welsh culture. Currently, there are 3,000 people in Wales who have fled war and persecution, including 78 from Syria - but the charity said the UK should take many more. For Mr Abdeen, now 34, he completed university and had what he believed was a ""bright future"" as an engineer until civil unrest in the country spread to the capital. ""I was an activist when I was a student, campaigning, trying to protect rights and criticising the government for bombing [province] Darfur,"" he said. ""The dictatorship didn't want such freedoms. They were tracking people and I was worried I would be put in jail and then killed which is what happened to others like me."" His uncle made arrangements and eight months ago, Mr Abdeen began what he described as ""a horrible journey"", travelling to Egypt and spending seven days on a small boat on the Mediterranean Sea before making it to Italy and moving through France. ""I arrived in the UK from Calais and went to the police station and they told me I would be safe here,"" he said. ""At first I went to London but it was busy. I like Cardiff, it is multi-cultural and I can ride a small bicycle around the city. I am awaiting a decision on my refugee status. I hope I get it so I can start my life again."" While all 22 Welsh local authorities have agreed to take refugees, the difficulty comes in matching families to an area that best matches their needs. For example, somebody from a city may feel isolated in parts of rural Powys or Ceredigion. 'Not good enough' The majority visiting the Eisteddfod with Oxfam were from Swansea and Cardiff and while they were happy to show them around, there was a sense of frustration the numbers here are not greater. ""There are currently millions of people on the move in the world, fleeing war and extreme poverty. The UK has taken in less than 1% despite being the sixth wealthiest nation in the world,"" Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of the charity in Wales, said. ""We could do more and should be a nation of sanctuary. In 1914, Wales took in 4,500 Belgian refugees. While they later went home, they left so many cultural benefits. We should have at least that many here now. ""There are still empty houses and school places. It's not good enough to say 'sorry we don't have room'. We took so many in 1914 in recognition that it could one day be us."" Former Prime Minister David Cameron committed the UK to take 20,000 refugees from war-torn Syria over the next five years. But Ms Davies-Warner said that number should be at least double, with Oxfam campaigning ahead of a conference of world leaders in September. After arriving on the Eisteddfod site, the refugees firstly had a Welsh taster session, where they learnt a few basic phrases such as ""bore da"" (good morning) and ""sut dy chi?"" (how are you?). As the group was instructed how to count to 10, Rakan, nine, shouted out the answers ahead of the tutor. Along with his mother May Alrariees, 32, and brother Amr, six, he has only been in Cardiff six months, yet has picked up some Welsh from school and was an enthusiastic fan of the Wales football team at Euro 2016. The family arrived in the country six months after dad Mohammad, 38, fled their home city of Homs in Syria. ""It was so bad, all the country was destroyed by fighting. There is nothing left now. I just got on an airplane and flew to London, where I got help,"" the former sales manager said. His wife, a civil engineer, used to sit at home in fear every day when he went to work. ""It was so frightening with the sound of bombs in the distance all day,"" she said. ""I couldn't send the children to school, it was too dangerous for them to play outside. They lost their freedom."" While they were able to join Mr Alrariees in Cardiff, they still fear for their parents and family who still live in their home city. ""But I like Cardiff. It feels like my Homs, it is very similar with the weather, the green areas, the kindness of the people,"" said Mrs Alrariees. While the couple look for work in their new city, they received words of encouragement from First Minister Carwyn Jones, who met the group at the Eisteddfod. ""Many asylum seekers and refugees who come to Wales have had their lives torn apart by war, persecution or natural disaster,"" he said. ""We are committed to helping them rebuild their lives.""","Most National Eisteddfod visitors would have travelled a couple of hours from north or west. But for others, the journey has been longer, more traumatic, and one that could have claimed their lives had they not been so fortunate."
"Becoming Henry Moore will mark the opening of the redeveloped Studio & Gardens in Hertfordshire, as well as the 40th anniversary of his foundation, created to support artists. The exhibition focuses on works from his formative years, from 1914 to 1930. It also includes exhibits from artists who influenced the sculptor. Among the works on show is Moore's first commission from his student days, a World War One roll of honour for his secondary school, which has never before been seen outside his hometown of Castleford, in West Yorkshire. This work, and others including his Reclining Figure, will be exhibited at the Henry Moore Studios & Gardens in Perry Green, near Bishop's Stortford, which has been transformed to include a visitor centre, cafÃ© and classrooms. Moore's works will be shown alongside those of artists who inspired him, such as Picasso, Rodin, Michelangelo and British contemporaries including Barbara Hepworth and Jacob Epstein. In the 40 years since Moore and his family set up the Henry Moore Foundation to encourage appreciation of the art world and support artists and projects throughout the world, it has awarded grants worth more than Â£31m to over 2,000 projects and individuals. Becoming Henry Moore runs until 22 October.",A new exhibition of the works of sculptor Henry Moore has been put together following a Â£7m revamp of his former home.
"Kent Fire and Rescue Service was called to Howletts Wild Animal Park near Canterbury at 0930 GMT. Keepers said Umna, a 13-year-old African elephant, had collapsed after becoming seriously ill with colic. Faversham watch manager Ian West said: ""Hopefully this will be a once-in-a-career incident but it'll definitely stick in my memory."" Neil Spooner, the animal director at Howletts, said he found the elephant collapsed on its side just after 0730 GMT. He said: ""She was lying down in her bedroom on her right side and her left side appeared bloated. 'Begging position' ""It became immediately obvious to me that this was colic, a life-threatening condition. ""The main priority with colic is to get the animal up and moving."" Howletts staff made two attempts to lift the two-tonne animal using ropes and a forklift truck before calling the fire service. Mr West said crews from Faversham and Whitstable were joined by members of the urban search and rescue team. He said: ""Our team is more used to rescuing cattle and horses, so we explained to the park team how we would like to go about the rescue, based on our expertise. ""We placed straps around the front of Umna's body and then used a winch to lift her legs into a 'begging' position. ""As soon as she was able to manage her own weight, we released the straps and she walked free.""",A sick elephant that had collapsed on its side at a Kent animal park had to be winched upright by fire crews.
"Callum Fitzpatrick, from Ballymartin, County Down, said he ""burst into tears"" when he matched five numbers and the bonus ball in last Saturday's draw.

"The head, limbs and ears of the ginger cat had been cut off before it was returned to its home in Betjeman Court in Northampton. The 14-year-old made the discovery when she looked into a plastic bag on Monday. Police said the mutilation happened days after the family's other cat was killed when it was deliberately set on fire. In the latest incident the cat, known as Rusty, had been taken from its home sometime between 21:30 BST on Sunday and 10:00 on Monday. PC Andrew Glover said the one-year-old cat was ""a beloved pet and the family are understandably devastated"".

"Reports surfaced over the weekend that the former private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge was set for the job. But it was confirmed on Tuesday, with the PM saying Mr Case was ""ideally suited for this crucial role"". It comes after Sir Mark Sedwill announced in June he would stand down following reports of tensions between him and members of the PM's team. Mr Case, 41, was made permanent secretary at No 10 earlier this year and he has been a civil servant since 2006. He spent almost two years working as Prince William's right-hand man before temporarily moving to Downing Street to assist with the coronavirus response. Now he will become both the head of the Civil Service and the new cabinet secretary, tasked with advising the prime minister on implementing policy and the conduct of government. The prime minister's official spokesman said No 10 works closely with the royal household. And it is understood the PM spoke to the Duke of Cambridge about the appointment. In a statement, Mr Case said it was ""an honour"" to be appointed, adding: ""Over these few months of working on the Covid response, I have seen how much hard work is being done by the Civil Service to support the government and our country through unprecedented times. ""It is a privilege to come into this role to lead a service that is working day in, day out to deliver for people right across the country."" Former cabinet secretary Lord Gus O'Donnell said Mr Case ""knows how to make things happen"" and had ""clearly developed the trust of the prime minister"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""a surprise to have someone so young"" in the role, but said the new top civil servant had plenty of Downing Street experience, adding: ""I'm sure he will grow into the role."" 'Unwelcome advice' Lord O'Donnell, who served in the role between 2005 and 2011, said one of Mr Case's tasks would be getting the prime minister to ""understand he needs to work with the civil service rather than against them"". Some opposition parties have claimed the appointment is political, with Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, tweeting: ""[The] problem with 'close allies' or some might say 'cronies' is that they often tend to say what you want to hear."" But Tory Former Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said Mr Case would ""do his utmost for whoever is the elected"" and that he was ""nobody's patsy"". He said the new cabinet secretary was ""unafraid to give ministers candid advice, even if it's unwelcome"". His appointment comes two months after Sir Mark announced he was planning to step down from the role. In a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Sir Mark said it was the right time to go as the government moved to the next phase of its coronavirus recovery plan. Sir Mark is also stepping down as national security adviser to the PM. But the job is now being split into a separate role, with the PM's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost - who is not a civil servant - taking over. The PM praised Sir Mark on Tuesday for his ""outstanding service"", while Mr Case thanked him for his ""kindness and support"". The job will switch hands on 9 December. 'Shake-up' The new posting also comes within the wider context of a ""fairly radical shake-up"" of the civil service, BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said. This year has seen a number of senior civil servants in various departments unexpectedly announce they are leaving their posts. Jonathan Slater, the chief civil servant at the Department for Education, was sacked earlier this month following the row over A-level and GCSE results in England. He became the fifth permanent secretary to leave his post in six months. Sir Richard Heaton resigned as permanent secretary at the Ministry of Justice in July, saying it had been ""a privilege"" to lead at the Ministry of Justice, despite ""challenging years"". Sir Philip Rutnam quit as permanent secretary of the Home Office in February, announcing he would take the Home Secretary Priti Patel to an employment tribunal. And Sir Simon McDonald announced in June he would step down in as permanent secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in September ""at the request"" of the prime minister.",Simon Case will take over as the UK's top civil servant next week after being appointed by Boris Johnson.
"The Victorian pier was almost destroyed in an arson attack in October 2010. Since the fire the owner of the pier, Panamanian-based company Ravenclaw, has failed to respond to approaches by Hastings Borough Council. Councillor Peter Chowney, lead member for regeneration, said the order would be issued on 19 March. The company was served a repairs notice at the end of November, which paved the way for the compulsory purchase. Mr Chowney said: ""We have given Ravenclaw every chance to put things right and yet again they have failed to face their responsibilities. ""That being the case we will issue a compulsory purchase order on the week beginning 19 March."" He said the council would work with the Hastings Pier and White Rock Trust, which aims to refurbish the pier. Up to 95% of the pier, which had been closed since 2006, was damaged in the arson attack. Two men, then aged 18 and 19, were arrested shortly afterwards but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in April that there was not enough evidence to bring charges.",A compulsory purchase order will be issued to the owner of Hastings Pier after it failed to meet a deadline to start repair work.
"Northamptonshire County Council said resources are so stretched it had ""no option"" but to change the contract. Branch secretary for Unison in the county Steve Bennett said workers had already backed industrial action. He said the council was losing the ""goodwill"" of staff over this issue. The union and the council have been in talks over the new contract since October last year. The council says it has to save Â£4m from employment costs. 'Stark choices' The new job conditions would see staff pay taken out of the national pay bargaining system, so pay will be decided at a local level. It also includes reducing the six months of full sickness pay to 12 weeks and the following six months of half-sickness pay to 12 weeks, and freezing the performance related pay scheme for two of the next four years. Charlie MacNally, director of adult and children's services, said: ""These are unprecedented times and having to look at wider employment costs will not be welcome by anyone. The stark choices we face are reducing services or reducing costs. ""We are reducing costs in all other areas of expenditure where we are able but we are now left with no option but to look at employment costs. ""I recognise the commitment all our employees show and these proposals are in no way a reflection of the significant achievements you make every day. However we all have no option but to address the financial realities that face the council and indeed society as a whole.""",A union has criticised a council after it sent out letters to staff asking them to accept new job conditions - with cuts to sick pay allowances - or face dismissal and re-employment.
"Biffa says that its crews found 93 people sleeping in rubbish last year. It says the cameras, fitted to 140 of its 800 trucks, would remind staff to check bins before emptying them. Last year four people sheltering in bins died when they were tipped into the back of trucks. Biffa's Tim Standring told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours the cameras would give drivers extra ""peace of mind"" and that some vehicles would also record footage from inside hoppers. 'Machines don't differentiate' The company was not spying on its staff, he said, saying the move was designed to protect them from the ""anguish"" of not realising a person had been inside the bin. Mr Standring, the firm's divisional health, safety, environment and quality coach, said: ""If it's the only place you've got to stay and it's the most secure place I can kind of see the appeal, but the down side of it is if we don't find you, you're not going to survive."" He added: ""Once you're in the hopper, the blade comes down and it crushes and breaks the waste and it will take it back into the body [of the vehicle] where it's compacted again. ""These machines won't differentiate between cardboard, wood and unfortunately people as well."" Biffa hopes that all of its refuse lorries will have the new technology by the end of the year. The company formed a partnership with the Chartered Institute of Waste Management and homelessness service StreetLink to raise awareness of the issue of people sleeping in bins. The organisations carried out research last year that showed that 28 of the 176 waste management organisations surveyed reported finding people sheltering in bins over the previous 12 months.",One of the UK's biggest waste companies is fitting cameras to its vehicles in a bid to reduce the number of homeless people killed after sleeping rough in industrial-sized wheelie bins.

"By David Pittam & Greig WatsonBBC News, East Midlands Attention has mostly been focused on the city itself, but what of the suburbs on its fringes? Oadby, a town to the south east of Leicester, has come into closer proximity with the city due to the steady expansion of both and is included in the lockdown area. Do Oadby's residents feel this is justified? Are they optimistic about the future? Do they feel part of the city or look to the county? Scott Drake, 42, owner of S and J Fruit and Veg, with a stall the town's market, said: ""When I heard the news I thought 'Oh no, not again'. ""But I think they need to lock down the whole of Leicestershire properly. The problem is the government is playing about with everyone. ""They're saying to people in Oadby, you stay in but to people in Stoughton (a village about two miles away), you go and get a haircut and a pint. ""So what's this lockdown going to do? Because Mavis in Oadby is going to just go to Stoughton to have her beer and get her hair done."" Former local council leader Michael Griffiths, 72, said: ""I think it's sensible but shows the whole country should have been left for another two or three weeks. ""I understand Oadby hasn't had a major problem but it's guilty by association,"" said Mr Griffiths, an Oadby resident since he was 15. ""I was surprised at first when I heard it was included but thinking about it, we are pretty close to the city. ""I can see why it needs to be done."" Hassan Ali, is general manager of Tipu Sultan, a restaurant in the town. He said: ""We were excited to reopen on Saturday; everyone wants some freedom. We were 100% sure we definitely would and were about 70% of the way through preparations. ""We thought it would just be Leicester so when he said Oadby that was a shock. ""We were upset when we heard the news, it was a bit of a blow; when you're that close to something there's a bit of frustration when it's cancelled. ""But we have to do it. Health and safety is the most important thing."" Michelle Zviuya, a 30-year-old healthcare assistant at Leicester Royal Infirmary, had been hoping Oadby would not be included. ""It's not that I was dying for a pint,"" she said. ""But I was meant to be meeting a friend and her little one who I've not seen since November. But she's on the other side of the boundary. ""I didn't think it would be here too; they need to show us the figures for the area instead of just the whole of Leicester. ""But it is what it is. It's only two weeks."" Another resident, 31-year-old Rupen Popat, said he had thought it was ""inevitable"" they would be on lockdown if Leicester was too, as people like him travel in and out of the city for work.

"Daryl Hargrave, who had a history of mental health problems, was found hanged in his cell in July 2015. He had been on remand for six days, an inquest in the city heard. The jury found there was a failure to provide treatment for psychosis, and a decision not to put him under constant supervision also contributed to his death. Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which manages healthcare at HMP Winchester, apologised for its failings and ""the distress this process has caused the family"". It added improvements had already been made, including all mental health referrals now going to one point of contact and defibrillator training for all clinical staff. Assistant coroner Karen Harrold said she had concerns about the risk of future deaths at the prison and felt further steps were needed. Mr Hargrave's death was one of three self-inflicted deaths at HMP Winchester in two months during 2015. Following an unannounced visit in 2014, inspectors described the prison as ""insufficiently safe"" with ineffective anti-bullying measures. After the inquest, Mr Hargrave's mother Nicky said: ""All we can ask is that lessons are learned and for the prison to get more resources and more training."" Solicitors representing the family said Mr Hargrave, from Gosport, had shown ""clear symptoms"" of psychosis days before his death and had told staff he had ""demons in his blood, telling him to harm himself"". The jury heard he was arrested for allegedly being involved in a fight, and had been in prison for six days when he died. His mother said he had struggled with addictions and had a history of mental health problems and self-harming. The Ministry of Justice said the safety and welfare of people in its custody was a ""top priority"" but added it recognised there had been ""significant failings"" in Mr Hargrave's care. It added a ""number of measures to better support offenders"" had been put in place.","Neglect contributed to the death of a 22-year-old man at Winchester prison, an inquest jury has concluded."
"Inverness Properties plan to build 16 homes at Viewhill, which is about half a mile from the location of the battle. Highland councillors refused the developer planning permission. But, following an appeal by Inverness Properties, a Scottish government-appointed planning official has granted permission with conditions. Fought on 16 April 1746 near Inverness, Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his Jacobite force were defeated at Culloden by a government army led by the Duke of Cumberland. The fighting took place over a wider area than the parts of the battlefield that are in the care of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS). Culloden is on a battlefield inventory put together by Historic Scotland. The Scottish government-appointed reporter has decided that planning permission can be granted subject to an agreement being reached on a financial contribution from the developer towards affordable housing and footpaths. A government spokesperson said: ""Once this agreement has been reached, the reporter will issue his final decision on the appeal. ""The reporter has agreed with Historic Scotland that it is unlikely that the proposal would have any impact on the character and ambience of the battlefield.""",A proposed housing development opposed by the National Trust for Scotland because the site is close to Culloden Battlefield has secured approval.

""Driving back after a lovely meal at a Chinese restaurant we pulled into a quiet spot on a country lane in Aldworth,"" he explained. ""Suddenly I felt my meal drop from stomach to bowel in one lurch. I knew I couldn't hold it.

""As I relieved myself I badly attempted to disguise the sound with sudden coughing bouts. ""I could hear my date asking from inside the car if I was alright whilst I scrabbled about for anything I could find to clean myself up with, all the time providing a running commentary to my date about my 'bite' and insisting she stay in the car as there were more wasps.

"Lyrico Steede died five days after he was knifed in the chest, back and leg in Nottingham in February. An 11-week trial at Nottingham Crown Court heard he was lured to a park by a 15-year-old girl before being chased and stabbed by four boys on a nearby road in the Bulwell area of the city.

"The lorry rolled down an embankment beside the A828 near Appin, in Argyll and Bute, at about 03:30 on Wednesday. Bear Scotland said the driver was uninjured but left shaken after the incident. A spokeswoman confirmed no other vehicles were involved and a full accident investigation was under way. Temperatures are set to drop further on Thursday, with -14 (7F) predicted for parts of Scotland. The deepest snowfall recorded by the Met Office at 09:00 on Wednesday was 11cm (4in) at Tulloch Bridge, Inverness-shire. More than 40 schools across the Highlands were closed due to the weather conditions. The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for ice affecting many parts of Scotland from 17:00 on Wednesday until 11:00 on Thursday. More snow could fall in the eastern part of the country on Thursday afternoon, and a further yellow warning is in place for parts of north and east Scotland on Thursday night and Friday morning. BBC weather presenter Simon King said Thursday morning is likely to be ""the coldest start to the winter so far"". Much of the country will see temperatures well below freezing, with -14C (7F) possible in rural Aberdeenshire, he added. Police Scotland said the gritter overturned on the A828 near the Old Inn. A spokeswoman said: ""The driver was taken to hospital as a precaution but we have not been made aware of any serious injuries. ""As the lorry had left the road, it wasn't blocking it, but we put up police tape to make it safe. Bear Scotland were making arrangements for the recovery of the vehicle.""

"The Scottish Hospitality Group (SHG) said its members took only 20% of last year's earnings during the crucial Christmas trading period. It estimated members lost on average Â£12,000 in revenue per week, per premises. SHG represents several well-known bar and restaurant businesses, including DRG Group, Signature Pubs and G1 Group. In a statement, the group said the ""massive"" cut in revenue would impact payments for property and equipment rent and utilities until at least the summer, affecting suppliers and investors among others. It also maintained that revenue losses would throw into doubt existing plans for Â£30m of investment in 27 premises which would create hundreds of new jobs, as well as protect existing ones. SHG spokesman Stephen Montgomery said: ""Without Christmas, when we earn around 30% of our entire annual income, most hospitality businesses just aren't viable. ""We've had the worst December's trading in living memory and we're facing the worst start to a year ever."" 'Completely inadequate support' SHG also described the financial support available during the coronavirus pandemic as ""completely inadequate"", and claimed that much of it had yet to come through. It also argued that it was ""unclear even what businesses are entitled to due to conflicts between the Holyrood and Westminster governments"". SHG said: ""Instead of helping, our political leaders are squabbling with each other. It's like arguing about who throws the lifebelt when someone's already under water."" The group also said that during lockdown, businesses spend on average of nearly Â£6,000 per week per premises on fixed costs and contributions to the furlough scheme. It called on the Scottish and Westminster governments to work together to support the sector. Mr Montgomery said: ""We will soon be proposing specific, realistic measures that both governments can introduce so we've got a fighting chance of getting back on our feet by next year. ""First of all though, we need them to grow up and start working together so that the hospitality sector still exists to drive our economic recovery once the virus is under better control."" 'Horrendous December' First Minister Nicola Sturgeon acknowledged at a media briefing on Thursday that December had been ""horrendous"" for hospitality businesses. Most were shuttered in the central belt of Scotland throughout the month, while others elsewhere had strict opening times imposed on them. When asked if she believed support had arrived quickly enough, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I always want things to happen more quickly. ""I want to see the money, the substantial amounts of money we are rightly making available to businesses that are impacted, get to those businesses as soon as possible. ""There's more than Â£2bn gone to businesses already and with hospitality in particular, where businesses are closed for a lengthy period, the money is paid every few weeks, so it's an ongoing support."" Ms Sturgeon also pointed to ""top-up"" payments announced before Christmas for hospitality to help recoup some losses from the festive trading period. 'Swift action' A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We've taken swift action throughout the pandemic to protect lives and livelihoods, and this week's cash injection will ensure we continue to support businesses and jobs through to the spring. ""We've already extended the furlough scheme until April, providing certainty for businesses as they navigate the months ahead. ""And we'll have a Budget in early March to take stock of our wider support, and set out the next stage in our economic response.""","Most hospitality businesses are not viable following a ""devastating"" December, an industry body has warned."

"Aircraft noise campaigner David Howden, who lives in Langton Green, Tunbridge Wells, said sleep was being ruined. Gatwick has an annual quota of 14,000 take-offs and landings at night and said it tried to minimise the impact on residents. It has appealed to the government not to reduce that, arguing it would cost jobs. Mr Howden said: ""It is a problem because the density of traffic at Gatwick is increasing. ""One of stated objectives is to double the amount of aircraft movements at Gatwick by the mid-'20s."" 'Better understanding' He said daytime flights also caused problems but conceded there was little prospect of forcing a reduction in them, particularly as the owners want to build a second runway to meet increased demand in south-east England. ""We would ideally like to see, as at Heathrow, the cessation of night-time operations, and if that can be achieved, I think there will be a much better understanding from people about daytime operations,"" he said. ""It is worse at night. Some of the aircraft... generate an unfortunate high-pitch whine when they are in descent, and in the still of night it is a very disturbing noise."" A spokesperson for the airport said: ""Every effort is made to minimise the impacts of aircraft noise on local communities, including encouraging airlines to fly quieter planes and working closely with [National Air Traffic Services] to introduce successful noise-reduction measures. ""We will continue to work with the airline community to identify and implement further noise mitigation measures for the benefits of our local communities."" The Department for Transport said the next set of night-flight quotas at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted would come into force in October 2014 following a consultation, which ended in April.",A new call to ban night flights at Gatwick Airport has come from people living more than 20 miles away in Kent.
"In the year 2013-14, just over a quarter (28%) of offenders were reconvicted within a year. Those released from short jail sentences - three months or less - were more likely to reoffend than those given longer prison terms or sentenced to community payback orders. The Scottish government said the figures were ""encouraging"". The biggest improvement on reoffending was for younger offenders. Over the past 10 years, the average number of reconvictions per offender dropped by nearly a third for offenders aged 21 to 25. On average, those who were sentenced to six months or less in prison were reconvicted twice as often as those given community payback orders, the most common type of community sentence. 'Key goal' While the number of reconvictions for people on Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) rose last year, the rate has dropped by a third over the past 10 years. Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said: ""Today's figures show we are continuing to make good progress on tackling reoffending - a key goal of this government's justice strategy. ""The continued fall in reconvictions is testament to the work done by our police, courts and other partners in communities across Scotland to prevent offending and, where crimes do occur, stop people going on to commit further offences."" Key statistics: The justice secretary added: ""I have set out my vision for a Scotland where people are held to account for their offending and are then given the opportunity to change their lives and become active members of society. ""The evidence backs up our approach that robust community sentences, such as CPOs, are more effective at reducing reoffending than short custodial sentences."" He added: ""Today's statistics build on the strong work being done in Scotland's justice system, with recorded crime at a 41-year low, youth offending and knife crime down and an end to automatic early release for all long-term prisoners. ""It is encouraging to see but we will not be complacent in our efforts to reduce crime even further.""","Reconviction rates for offenders in Scotland have fallen to their lowest level for 17 years, figures reveal."
"By Hazel ShearingBBC News ""Half a million people turned upâ¦ but the town was dead,"" she says. Shops in the Dorset town's centre have spent years competing with online retailers and alternative shopping hubs with free parking. Bubble tea cafes and brunch spots have sprung up in place of some that have folded. Now, many shops, restaurants and bars find themselves grappling with the additional challenges posed by coronavirus - and there are fears it could be the ""nail in the coffin"" for some businesses. Neelam, keeping half an eye on the one customer perusing a display of iPad cases, says the shop is a lot quieter than it was this time last year. She thinks more people have become used to online shopping during lockdown, while students, who make up the majority of their trade, haven't been in since the university closed. People come to the high street for a day out, not to spend, she says. ""A lot of them do say 'we're waiting to get back into work to get a proper wage to then have that money'. So we're hopefulâ¦ but it's a waiting game."" The shutters on the jewellers opposite have been down since March. A few doors down, the windows of the M&S I was dragged around by my nan as a child have been boarded up for two years. It's a warm Saturday and there are lots of people about. But, if I think about it, not as many as there would usually be at this time of year. Outside Clarks, where I spent my weekends fitting kids' shoes as a teenager, taxi drivers Steve Cox and Phil Zamora are waiting for their next clients. It's around 3pm and Phil has only had three jobs all day. Steve says the station hasn't been much better. ""It's about two to three hours waiting and when the trains are coming in there's nobody on them,"" he says. ""It's not worth coming, we come out because that's what we do."" Phil works day shifts but the closure of nightclubs has had a knock-on effect. ""These guys that work nights, because there's no work, they come out in the daytime now. It now dilutes the work,"" he says. In the square, Laura Dickie is handing out flyers for her new discount designer clothing pop-up. She is upbeat, noting that the furlough scheme means weekdays are just as busy as weekends and discounts have become even more appealing. ""Because people want that bargain, they're happy to spend the money. They still want the designer names and the designer brands,"" she shrugs. On the other side of town, Carol and Ben Coulston are sat on a bench in a newly-pedestrianised area outside Beales, which folded in March. They normally come to town to shop and socialise but many of their elderly friends are staying away because of coronavirus. Carol reckons around a dozen shops are empty on this street, while some businesses that collapsed have been replaced by lunch spots. A sushi shop and an ice-cream parlour opposite used to be Clintons Cards and Jones Bootmaker. ""General shopping, there seems to be less and less,"" says Ben. ""If you need to get a pair of boot laces you can't get them. You can get a sandwich anywhere."" 'A tough fight' Bournemouth is reflective of a broader shift to hospitality in town centres, says Rod Cake, a director on the Bournemouth Town Centre Business Improvement District (BID). He believes that drinks venues, like his own sports bar, will see a resurgence in spending eventually - especially with the European Football Championship and World Cup not far off the horizon - but he's concerned for shops. According to the BID's most recent survey, just 13% of visitors thought the shops were ""excellent"" in 2018 - a fall from 27% in 2011. Yet 41% gave Bournemouth's restaurants the highest rating. The biggest turn-offs among visitors was the number people sleeping rough (64%) and the cost of parking (59%). There is a shopping centre a short drive away with free parking. To boost the town centre, the BID has launched a ""spend local, stay local"" campaign, and has promoted town centre gift cards but Rod Cake says it is hard to make plans amid the uncertainty. ""It's going to be a tough fight. I think it was a tough industry before coronavirus,"" he says, adding that the pandemic will be a ""final nail in the coffin"" for some shops. But even some dining hubs are struggling. In the relatively new Bh2 complex, home to an Odeon cinema and a string of chain restaurants, a group of holidaymakers from Hastings are assessing their dinner options. Pizza Express? Closed. Handmade Burger Co.? Closed. Even the ice-cream stand is closed and it's 20Â°C outside. Those food venues that rely on office workers have been hit especially hard. Just outside of the town centre, in an Italian brasserie situated near several insurance companies, Hassan and Tracy Sefat say they would serve about 50 people on a weekday before the pandemic - but now it's just one or two. ""We've got the outside area, but they're not here. They get the money on furlough and they say, 'I'm not taking a risk',"" Hassan says, adding that bosses should ask employees to come back to the office. ""They have to come out andâ¦ give to local people's businesses for them to survive."" 'Hopefully we'll survive' The Sefats' restaurant has also been hit by a fall in wedding parties, as well as stag and hen dos. Clubbing is one of the things Bournemouth is best known for, after all. Outside a string of shuttered-up clubs and closed chicken shops, a group of men in their early 20s walk past reminiscing about pre-lockdown nights out. Usually, a few hours from now, this place would be heaving. But Alan Dove, another director on the BID, says late-night venues are ""on their knees"". ""What they need is clarity, assistance with fixed costs and VAT relief when they open to rebuild business reserves and customer confidence. If these things don't happen they will close,"" he says. The drinking venues that have been able to reopen are having to adapt to survive. Peter Hector only opened his micro-pub on the outskirts of town three years ago, and was just starting to break even when the pandemic hit. Now he's buying in cans and bottles for takeaways, and has launched an app for customers to place orders. His takings on Friday night were down around 40% on this time last year - and extra precautions such as Perspex screens on tables have cost him hundreds. ""Hopefully we will survive, but I don't know,"" he says. ""I think when the winter comes that is going to be the test. If we do get a second spike it will finish off a lot of small businesses.""","When Neelam Kumari heard that thousands of people were flocking to Bournemouth beach last month, she thought it could be good for business. Now, standing behind a Perspex screen in a phone accessories and repairs shop in the town centre, she shakes her head."
"The blaze broke out at the RSPB Dee Estuary nature reserve at Denhall Quay, Wirral. A patrolling warden said four youths were seen fleeing the scene, and a police investigation is under way. The fire, on 8 April, has now been discovered to have killed rare harvest mice and incinerated birds' nests. RSPB staff said arson attacks on the site have been a problem for ""a number of years"". 'Important breeding ground' Site manager Colin Wells said: ""The harvest mice have lost their habitat and many of them may have been injured or killed. ""The area is an important breeding ground for birds such as reed buntings and water rails. They have lost their nesting areas. ""It's devastating, as we work so hard to create and maintain this site for wildlife and people to enjoy.""

"You may have pondered why it costs Â£21.40 to travel the 52 miles between Flint and Bangor but just Â£17.30 to travel the 51 miles between Swansea and Newport. A journey from Bangor to Holyhead works out at 41p a mile when the journey between Wrexham Central and Shotton works out at 23p a mile. We asked an expert to explain. Prof Stuart Cole, professor of transport at the University of South Wales, said tickets on the north Wales mainline were more expensive than the south Wales mainline because the former is more influenced by the UK government's fares policy and the latter by the Welsh Government's policies. This is to a large part the result of demand and revenue levels and where the fares decision was made historically when north Wales' services were managed from north-west England. There are currently four main train companies that operate within Wales: These train operating companies run passenger services, leasing and managing stations from Network Rail and trains from rolling stock companies. ""GWR, Virgin and Cross Country rail franchises are controlled by the UK government's Department for Transport,"" said Prof Cole. ""TfW Rail Services takes its direction from Welsh Government through TfW the rail authority. ""Prices are higher in north Wales because the fares are negotiated between Transport for Wales, the UK's Department for Transport and Virgin Trains - a historical legacy and market position. ""In south Wales TfW have a greater influence over fares and on the route between Cardiff and Swansea the Welsh Government subsidises TfW services. ""The Welsh Government policy is to maintain fares at as low a price as possible using subsidy payments."" He said the difference in the two government's policies could be seen by comparing two commuter routes. ""Dorking to London Waterloo and Aberdare to Cardiff are both commuter routes into capital cities and both journeys are 23 miles. ""The cost for a single from Dorking to London is Â£12.50 but it's just Â£6.10 between Aberdare and Cardiff. ""People in Dorking can afford higher fares because their London wages are generally higher. Many people in the valleys wouldn't be able to afford the journey cost to get to work unless the Welsh Government subsidised their services to a higher extent than is the case in England."" Prof Cole added: ""TfW have also introduced a more sophisticated fares structure, including advance fares, particularly valuable for commuters and leisure travellers. ""In addition, fares on Valley Lines will be reduced by over 10% from January 2020. We would expect a similar policy to be applied to north Wales services."" He said when it comes to TfW services, policy including fares and long term planning was very much directed by the Welsh Government: ""This is often misunderstood but there are, in name, two Transport for Wales. ""The policy decisions on fares, subsidy and investment are made by the Welsh Government which passes those decisions onto TfW - the rail authority for Wales - which then carries out the Welsh Government's wishes. ""Then TfW Rail Services run the day to day services; they are a company called KeolisAmey who trade under the TfW brand. The relationship between TfW - the authority where James Price is the chief executive, and KeolisAmey is the same as the relationship which the Welsh Government had with [previous franchise holder] Arriva Trains Wales."" He said pricing was mostly dictated by how much subsidy the Welsh Government wanted to put into the railway, adding: ""There are many social, strategic and economic considerations. ""The Welsh Government is trying to get more people to travel by train. ""In the biggest area of road congestion - Cardiff - the government wants to reduce that congestion and its consequent pollution and economic cost by attracting commuters and other travellers into the capital to switch to train where fare levels are known to be one of the key incentives."" A Welsh Government spokesman said fares were calculated using a number of factors including zonal systems and route subsidies, which could create anomalies. So will people in the north of the country be getting cheaper rail travel any time soon? ""Until James Price's TfW takes over responsibility fully for north Wales it will always be more expensive to catch a train there,"" he added.",Have you ever wondered who came up with the price of your train ticket and how they reached that figure?
"From November, all new constable recruits will be able to choose between full-time or part-time working hours. The force said it believed it was the first in the UK to offer part-time positions. The Met's own research showed full-time working hours deterred some women from considering a career in policing. ""The case for doing this was clear - we know that one of the obstacles stopping people from fulfilling their dreams of becoming a police officer has been the lack of flexibility in how they have to train and balance their family life,"" Commissioner Cressida Dick said. ""We will continue to break down barriers where we know they exist as we strive to open up a career in policing with the Met to even more people."" The Met Police Federation said it was not clear how the scheme would work when ""there is a massive incident that requires officers to be called on at short notice"". ""We are very wary over the demands that having an increased number of part-time colleagues will have on existing officers policing London during unprecedented times,"" chairman Ken Marsh said. ""Any scheme which helps us to recruit and retain more female police officers and colleagues from diverse communities is to be welcomed. ""However, we must not compromise, and should ensure that we continue to hire the best to be Metropolitan Police officers.""

"Mark McDonald, the SNP MSP for Aberdeen Donside, said he was stepping down from his role as childcare and early years minister. He apologised and said his attempts to be ""humourous"" or ""friendly"" may have led others to become uncomfortable. He is one of two SNP members currently being investigated by the party over possible misconduct. It is understood the allegations against him are not criminal in nature. The other complaint being investigated by the SNP does not relate to a parliamentarian. In a statement he said: ""It has been brought to my attention that some of my previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate - where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behaviour might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions. ""My behaviour is entirely my responsibility and I apologise unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate. ""In light of my position in government, I believe it would not be appropriate for me to continue to serve in my role in the Scottish government at this time and I have tendered my resignation as a minister. ""I hope that in taking this step neither any particular woman or my family will be the focus of undue and unwarranted scrutiny. ""It has been an honour to serve in the Scottish government and I will continue to serve my constituents in Aberdeen Donside to the best of my ability."" A former Aberdeen City councillor, Mark McDonald was elected as a list MSP at Holyrood in 2011 and became a constituency MSP when he won the Aberdeen Donside by-election in 2013, following the death of Brian Adam. The 37-year-old was responsible for a members bill on high hedge disputes, which passed unanimously at Holyrood. He was appointed a minister in May 2016. Earlier this week First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Deputy First Minister John Swinney both warned men - including those in the SNP - to reflect on their behaviour as allegations of sexual harassment reached Holyrood. A spokesperson for the first minister said: ""Mark has taken the right action in apologising and recognising that in his current role it would be inappropriate for him to remain in government. ""He will continue to make a valuable contribution to parliament as the MSP for Aberdeen Donside. ""As the deputy first minister told parliament earlier in the week it is right that men take responsibility for their behaviour and it is to Mark's credit that he has done so.""

"The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it would also conduct a ""thematic review"" of past and current cases to identify any trends. It comes as 18 officers are being investigated over racism allegations. The IPCC said it was now looking at a further two cases of allegations of racism, bringing the total to five. The two additional investigations are an allegation of racial abuse in December 2011 and another in September last year of racial abuse and excessive force in custody. The IPCC had previously announced that it was looking into three allegations; one from a 21-year-old man who filmed an incident on a mobile phone, another of a 15-year-old youth allegedly assaulted at Forest Gate police station, and a third in which a group of police officers allegedly made racist comments to one another. The IPCC has decided not to investigate a further six complaints. IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin said: ""The police must not hide behind statistics and must recognise that actual recorded allegations of racism are probably an indication of much wider disaffection and dissatisfaction."" He added: ""We know that allegations of racism are often difficult to prove as in many cases they are a complainant's word against an officer or officers, but that does not necessarily mean it did not happen.""","All complaints of racism against Metropolitan Police officers are to be automatically referred to the police watchdog, it has been announced."
"Philippa Day, 27, was found collapsed at her Nottingham home beside a letter rejecting her request for an at-home benefits assessment in August 2019. She died after two months in a coma. Nottingham Coroner's Court heard the way her claim was dealt with was the ""predominant factor"" in her overdose. Recording a narrative conclusion, coroner Gordon Clow said he could not determine whether she intended to die rather than put her life at risk. 'Starving' Miss Day, who had been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder, had been receiving disabled living allowance (DLA) payments as she had type 1 diabetes. Those payments stopped in January 2019 after she made an application for a personal independence payment (PIP), reducing her income from Â£228 a week to Â£60. This, the inquest heard, was because a form she had sent went missing and her payments were not reinstated for months, despite her eligibility. This led to her taking out short-term loans and ending up in debt. The court heard in June, she called the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to say she was ""starving"" and ""couldn't survive like this for much longer"". She was then asked to attend a face-to-face assessment despite it being ""distressing"" for her, Mr Clow said. The coroner added Miss Day's mental health problems were ""exacerbated"" by the benefits process. He accepted it had been ""the last straw"" for Miss Day who was already experiencing a range of stressors. He said: ""Were it not for this problem, it is not likely that she would have [overdosed] on the 7th or 8th of August."" Call handlers repeatedly failed to flag that the case required ""additional support"" due to her mental health problems, the coroner said. The DWP did not tell her community psychiatric nurse that she had not returned the form before refusing her application, which could have resolved the issue. The coroner said call handlers received little to no training on personality disorders like Miss Day's - all that was available was a factsheet. Capita was made aware of the risks to Miss Day's health from a face-to-face interview by her community psychiatric nurse, but did not act on it, he added. Mr Clow said: ""Given the sheer number of problems in the handling of her claim, I am unable to conclude that each of these was attributable to individual human error."" He concluded the failure to administer her benefit claim in a way that avoided exacerbating her mental health problems was the ""predominant factor"" that caused Miss Day to overdose. 'Deeply tragic' Mr Clow recommended changes at both the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and Capita, the authorities involved. In a prevention of future deaths report, Mr Clow said the DWP should consider timely mental health training for call handlers and address ""poor record keeping"". The DWP and Capita were also directed to review the change of assessment process so that it does not ""create unnecessary distress"". A spokesman for the DWP said: ""This is a deeply tragic case. Our sincere condolences are with Miss Day's family and we will carefully consider the coroner's findings."" A Capita spokesman said the company also apologised for the mistakes made. ""We have strengthened our processes over the last 18 months and are committed to continuously working to deliver a high-quality, empathetic service for every claimant,"" he said. ""In partnership with the DWP, we will act upon the coroner's findings and make further improvements to our processes."" Analysis: Michael Buchanan, social affairs correspondent This conclusion amounts to a near dismantling of the process for applying for the main disability benefit for people with psychiatric problems. While around 40% of claimants for personal independence payments have mental health conditions, the inquest found that call handlers for the DWP didn't receive adequate mental health training. The coroner found there was an ""institutional assumption"" in the DWP that problems with a claim were the claimants' fault. Last year a report from the National Audit Office (NAO) found the department had investigated 69 suicides of benefit claimants since 2014-15. There were more cases they could have looked into, said the NAO, but in any case the department couldn't demonstrate any improvements from their investigations had actually been implemented.

"Bath and North East Somerset Council (Banes) has begun consulting with households on the planned restriction areas in Radstock and Westfield. Banes is investing Â£500,000 into safer speed limits across the district. The council says its 20mph scheme is ""a means of creating a culture where driving too fast in residential streets is seen as unacceptable"". Councillor Roger Symonds (Lib-Dem, Combe Down) said: ""The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents estimates that a pedestrian has a 90% chance of surviving being hit by a car at 20mph, falling to a 50% chance at 30mph and to 10% at 40mph.""",People in two communities near Bath are being consulted on plans to introduce a 20mph speed limit in residential roads.
"By Nick TarverBBC News Across the towns and villages of England, people are revolting over the size of their municipal Christmas decorations. In Stockton-on-Tees, a white material ""Christmas tree"" in the town centre has left locals feeling ""ashamed"", according to the local paper. And in Clacton councillors have removed a spindly 12ft (4m) tree - christened the ""Christmas twig"" - deeming it ""not man enough"" for their Essex town. But have displays got worse or is tinsel-tinted nostalgia clouding Christmas judgement? Sam Jordison, editor of the Crap Towns series of books, believes town displays seem to have got worse as people's home displays have got better. ""It's pretty hard for councils to compete,"" he said. ""Christmas lights are inherently crap anyway - what are people expecting? How are they are not going to look tacky? ""I can understand why people care, as anything that attracts people to local shops is a good thing and I can well imagine that with budgets being cut that they're getting less impressive. ""And a bad display looks really bad - a few lights bulbs on a string that are not brightening anything up draws attention to the fact they are low budget."" Some towns and cities, like Canterbury, have made the decision to scrap their lights altogether rather than persist with sub-standard ones. ""It was inevitable that this day would come"", said John Gilbey, leader of the city council. ""Christmas lights were a nice thing to do when we had money. ""But now they are not of sufficient quality to make a difference and there is simply no cash to invest in new displays. Instead of persisting with something sub-standard, the only option left is to stop doing it."" Critics would argue that some festive decoration is better than none. But a glance north to the coastal town of Herne Bay offers a lesson in what can go wrong. Last year the Kent town's decorations were deemed so bad that some of the crowd booed when the lights were switched on. One solution is to find a sponsor for the decorations. London's Regent Street has followed this policy for years and now Luton has caught up with the act. After the council announced its Christmas lights were under threat, Easyjet - the biggest operator at Luton Airport - stepped in to save them, although part of the deal was that some lights would be orange. The lights, which are due to be switched-on at a ceremony on Saturday, would have cost the council Â£13,000 to Â£15,000 to run. Despite festive lights slipping down many councils' Christmas wish lists, they are still seen by many as an essential means of attracting festive shoppers into high streets. Dr Alan Bradshaw, a senior lecturer in marketing at Royal Holloway University of London, said: ""If I owned a shop I would be worried if there were no Christmas displays or lights, especially if neighbouring boroughs or high streets had invested in them. ""At the early stages of the Christmas experience it builds up the mood."" With just over two weeks of Christmas shopping left, it is yet to be seen whether shoppers will be deterred by England's ""Christmas twigs"" or unlit town centres. But, according to Dr Bradshaw, perhaps a little less in terms of lights might prove to be a little more in terms of sales. ""Christmas shopping can be quite a manic affair, not everyone wants the extra atmosphere,"" he said. ""Shoppers can feel manipulated and retailers have to be aware not to push their customers too much. ""There's a tipping point between generating a festive atmosphere and going over the top.""","With festive shopping in full swing, town centres have begun switching on their Christmas lights to entice shoppers. But with businesses and town halls strapped for cash have Christmas displays got worse?"
"Robert Trigg, 52, of Worthing, denies the murder of Susan Nicholson and the manslaughter of Caroline Devlin. Lewes Crown Court heard Mr Trigg said he accidentally rolled on top of Ms Nicholson while she slept. Prosecuting, Duncan Atkinson QC said there were ""significant similarities"" between the deaths. Both women were subjected to violence by Mr Trigg, Mr Atkinson told the court. ""Inquiries have revealed that the defendant has a history of behaviour towards other women with whom he has been in a relationship that shows him to have behaved in a possessive, controlling and jealous way,"" the prosecutor said. Mother's Day death Jurors were told after one alleged outburst of aggression by Mr Trigg, Ms Devlin ""prophetically"" said ""I won't be here for my 40th"". The court heard Ms Devlin, a 35-year-old mother-of-four, was found dead in bed on Mothers' Day by one of her children at their home in Cranworth Road, Worthing, on 26 March 2006. Jurors were told the child went to ask what she wanted for breakfast but saw her naked body and believed she was asleep. Mr Atkinson said Mr Trigg had left the house but returned looking ""dazed and being weird"" before asking one of Ms Devlin's children to look at their mother as she lay upside down in bed with her head deep in the duvet. The alarm was then raised. At the time, a post-mortem examination recorded her death as being caused by an aneurysm, although there was no physical finding to support the conclusion, the jury heard. Mr Atkinson said police officers who attended believed her death was not suspicious, but added: ""Clearly, those officers were not in possession of the full picture."" Five years later, 52-year-old Susan Nicholson was found dead on a sofa the couple had slept on in Rowlands Road, Worthing, jurors heard. Mr Trigg, of Park Crescent, told emergency services he accidentally rolled on to her in his sleep, a theory considered plausible following post-mortem tests, the court was told. Jurors were told a neighbour, Hannah Cooper, described the relationship as ""volatile and violent"", with rows fuelled by alcohol and police called at least six times. Mr Atkinson said Mr Trigg had been cautioned in March 2011 for battery, in relation to a row with Ms Nicholson, who was punched in the face. On the morning of 17 April 2011, the court was told, Mr Trigg bought cigarettes and then called his brother, before he phoned Ms Cooper and said: ""It's Sue, I think she'd dead."" Jurors were told Ms Cooper dialled 999. Mr Atkinson said: ""At the time, as had occurred with Ms Devlin, the police treated the defendant as a bereaved partner rather than a suspect."" 'Changed personality' Jurors were told pathologist Dr Nathaniel Cary reassessed both cases and concluded Ms Nicholson was suffocated after having her head forced into the bed, while Ms Devlin's death was caused by a blow to the head. Dr Cary, in a review of the original pathology, said: ""It is very unlikely that someone asleep on a sofa with another could cause death in the manner proposed by simply rolling on to them."" Mr Atkinson highlighted similarities and said in both cases Mr Trigg was in a relationship with the women, that he and the women were intoxicated, that both died while he claimed they were asleep, and he did not dial 999. Later, a neighbour told the court Ms Devlin's personality changed noticeably after she started a relationship with Mr Trigg. Bridget Benger, a close friend of Ms Devlin, continued: ""She became very withdrawn. She lost her spark and she seemed to drink a little bit more as well."" She said Ms Devlin's eldest son had knocked on her door and said ""we can't wake mummy"" and she went round to find Mr Trigg at the bottom of the stair, appearing ""vacant"" and Ms Devlin face down on the bed. But under cross-examination, she also said Mr Trigg seemed to care for Ms Devlin and was openly affectionate towards her. The trial continues.","A ""jealous and controlling"" lover killed two girlfriends, but their deaths were recorded as accidental or natural, a court has heard."

Shrewsbury was ranked second, with Ipswich third and York and Chester completing the top five. Inverness came highest in Scotland, in sixth, with seventh-placed Llandrindod Wells the top Welsh location. 'Joy to discover' Participants in the survey were asked to rate their area based on 12 factors, including neighbourliness, how safe they felt, recreational facilities, sense of community, living costs, contentment and how proud they felt about their home. Richard Cooper, Conservative leader of Harrogate Borough Council, described the North Yorkshire town as a fantastic place to live. Harrogate facts ""We are surrounded by some of the UK's most beautiful scenery, have fantastic shopping, a wide variety of restaurants and cafes and great entertainment and leisure opportunities, including some unique experiences such as the elegant Turkish Baths,"" he said. ""As a floral town, we are also extremely lucky to have a significant number of parks and gardens in the immediate vicinity, which are a joy to discover.""

"Cleveland Police said the scheme targets the most prolific offenders to break the cycle of drug use, crime and prison. It will cost Â£12,000 per addict and also see them helped in other ways. The force estimates a core of 20 drug-dependent offenders in the city have cost the public Â£784,000 over the last two years on detected crimes. Similar trials in London and Darlington previously suggested such schemes reduce crime and drug use but they were criticised by campaigners Europe Against Drugs who said it ""perpetuates addicts' maintenance on the drug when the goal should always be abstinence"". The Middlesbrough plan will also see various agencies focusing on the most prolific offenders to provide medical, housing and other assistance to ""finally get users off drugs, off the streets and back into society"". Cleveland Police and Crime Commissioner Barry Coppinger said: ""It's clear that for a small group of addicts the current strategies are not working and if we don't try something new the cycle of offending and the enormous costs to society will simply continue and, in all likelihood, increase. ""For a fraction of the cost of their offending we can give these people hope and a chance to turn their lives around, protect the public and local economy and free up vital NHS and police resources currently devoted to dealing with this small group."" At the new Injectable Opioid Treatment clinic, users will be able to self-administer under supervision three times a day. Columnist and writer Peter Hitchens told BBC Tees drug users are criminals and should not be treated as people with an illness.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he doesn't want another full lockdown but national measures may need to be tightened and in many areas local lockdowns are already in place. Throughout lockdown we spoke to people in different situations to find out how they were dealing with life in a pandemic. So what did they learn? And how will they cope with whatever might come in the next few months? 'I'm staying off social media' Ella Simms, 28, lives with five housemates in north London. She spoke to us in March about living in a shared house. Having lost all her work at the beginning of lockdown she says she's better prepared. I've deleted all of my social media. It was just too much. I put on a bit of weight in lockdown and hurt my ankle so couldn't exercise and my self-esteem was getting down because I was seeing all these perfect people and bodies. So I got rid of all my social media and I just feel more present in the day now. I lost my work totally at the beginning of lockdown and I missed the furlough scheme by three days. What I really learned is that you have to protect your mental health. I swore quite a lot, but I didn't cry, I didn't feel deflated. I know I want to do more work as an actor, working on films and in television. I write every single morning now. I've learned to be patient, I think the number of times that I've wanted to complain to my housemates about something and had to bite my tongue - and then you find out that person is really struggling. We also got into a really good habit of cooking together. I'm really more confident now, maybe more than I was at the start of lockdown. I'm ready now. 'I write down my thoughts' Nick, a father-of-two from Kent, lives with anxiety and in March told us lockdown led to panic attacks. He says he's found ways to deal with his anxiety now. At the start of lockdown I'd go to bed with worries and they'd still be there waiting for me when I woke up. Like when you can't get a song out of your head. Now I keep a notepad by my bed and write down my thoughts. I've learnt that distraction and also talking to people about your anxiety is the best way to deal with it. I've been kept busy working from home and I now know when to go to bed, rather than stay up and carry on watching the news. I've stopped catastrophising. I've started going out for long bike rides on Sundays with other local dads and taken up tennis. But I'm more optimistic about the future than last time. It might take a year or two, but it will be OK. 'I will keep painting' Angela Steatham, from Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, in Wales, has chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and is ""99%"" still shielding. She still rarely leaves the house and has had to rethink her entire life. I can get lost for four or five hours and not even realise the time by just being immersed in my painting. I thought to myself I need to see lockdown as an enforced early retirement. So that's what I did. I always said when I retired I would move to Wales and start to paint and read again. Well, I was already living in Wales, so I started painting. In the early stages I was angry and I was bitter I felt powerless and that I had lost my independence as a person. I went from being a strong woman to totally losing my independence and I was struggling. But then I decided I had to change my mentality. I think now I've taken control of my lifestyle. Instead of seeing all the things that have been taken away from me I am trying to focus on the things I'd been granted. The only thing that I really really miss and feel sad about is not being able to see or hug my son. That has been heartbreaking. 'We dance and take walks' Single mum Carla Fitzgerald, 29, from Paignton, faced her first pregnancy alone and in self-isolation. While the first few weeks with her son, Troy, were a struggle, she is now enjoying motherhood. Troy and I listen to the radio, or music, and have a sing-a-long or dance on a regular basis. And we take walks. It's really good to be out in nature, taking in the surroundings and distancing yourself from the worry of the pandemic. What I've learned from lockdown is to just go with the flow of life, as nothing is guaranteed and everything changes daily. Just check in with yourself every now and then and try your best to think positively, as nothing is permanent. It has given me the opportunity to focus on my own postnatal needs and getting to know my baby and bond at my own pace. I will try to meet up with other mums to socialise but I've always got this constant anxiety about the virus. For now, I'm just making the most of my time I have with my little bundle of joy.

"He said he has left the party group because the UK government ""has broken its promise to deliver Brexit"". Mr Reckless had not been a member of the party. It comes as speculation mounts a Brexit Party assembly group could be formed. Tory group leader Paul Davies thanked him ""for his valuable contribution"" over the last two years. Mr Davies said: ""I appreciate there are strong views on Brexit but our commitment is clear - Wales and the rest of the United Kingdom must leave the European Union."" A spokesman for the South Wales East independent AM, who was declining interviews on Tuesday, said he had left the Tory group on ""good terms"". Nigel Farage has formed the Brexit Party to fight the EU elections, which are taking place on 23 May. Analysis by BBC Wales political editor Felicity Evans The main thing Mr Reckless' move does is intensify speculation that AMs who've defected from UKIP over the last few years will announce they want to form a new Brexit Party group in the assembly. Bear in mind that Nigel Farage is visiting Wales again on Wednesday - to Merthyr Tydfil - and Mark Reckless makes this announcement on the eve of that visit. You don't have to be a genius to work out that two and two makes four. No one is willing to confirm any of this. But while there's no confirmation, there's no denial either. And it would be the kind of dramatic flourish that Mr Farage would relish. One source has suggested the AMs are ironing out who is doing what, and what kind of policies they're going to pursue. If the group isn't announced, it might be because that has not been sorted out. There has been no confirmation from any of the individuals - Caroline Jones, Mark Reckless, David Rowlands and Mandy Jones - that are thought could be involved in a new group. Caroline Jones is known to have signed up to the Brexit Party as a supporter and was at a Newport rally earlier in May, as was Mr Reckless. One source said Mr Reckless' resignation was a step towards a new group, but did not mean it was a ""done deal"". Mr Rowlands, if he was to defect, would leave UKIP with two AMs, not enough to form a party group and would mean it would have to lose its staff. A UKIP group source said on Monday they had no concerns about Mr Rowlands, however, while a Brexit Party spokesman said a newspaper report of discussions over a new group was a ""great work of speculation"". It is the third time Mr Reckless has defected from a political group. Mr Reckless joined the Welsh Conservative group in 2017 after leaving UKIP, but did not rejoin the party he had served as an MP. He had been one of two Tory MPs to join UKIP in 2014 - his high profile defection proved to be a barrier to him rejoining the Conservatives as a full member. 'At face value' UKIP AM Neil Hamilton said David Rowlands told him and UKIP leader Gerard Batten that he would not be defecting. Mr Hamilton: ""He told me and he told Gerard Batten that he's not going to defect. ""I take his word at face value."" Of the reports and speculation of a Brexit group in the assembly, Mr Hamilton said: ""Given the history of the selfishness of those who were elected in 2016 as UKIP AMs to go off and do their own thing, out of frustrated ambition or whatever reason, of course I'm concerned when people betrayed the trust of the party that gave them the opportunity to become AMs and also the people who voted for them in the election. ""I don't think that's a very honest basis to form a new party."" What is a Welsh Assembly group? AMs generally are members of their party group - the organisation in the assembly which reflects which party they are a member of. It means that they can nominate people to act as chair-people of committees, have greater speaking rights in the chamber and get extra money to employ staff. In the assembly a group needs at least three AMs to form. There are currently four assembly groups - Labour, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and UKIP.","Former UKIP AM Mark Reckless has left the Conservative group in the assembly, he has announced."

"The works, to replace two large bolts near the top of the north tower, require weekend lane restrictions running from 03:00 until noon. Delays reached up to 35 minutes on Saturday but engineers hope to be finished before midday on Sunday. Further work is due for the end of the month and on two weekends after Easter. Forth Bridge authorities said that if the weather remained favourable on Sunday then it may be possible to lift restrictions early. Barry Colford, chief engineer and bridgemaster, said: ""These emergency repairs are essential - if we don't get them completed at the earliest opportunity then we could face far more disruptive and costly repairs at a future date."" Alternative routes Mr Colford said everything possible was being done to minimise disruption, but warned that significant delays were inevitable. He added: ""We are sorry for the inconvenience it will cause. Our advice is to avoid using the bridge at these times, find an alternative route or take the train."" Weekend traffic restrictions will also be required on Saturday 31 March and Sunday 1 April, and on two further weekends after Easter on dates still to be confirmed. The repairs were originally scheduled for last weekend after an inspection identified cracked nuts at both ends of one of the bolts that hold the vertical hanger ropes to the bridge's main suspension cables, but high winds meant they had to be postponed.",Emergency repairs which have caused delays on the Forth Road Bridge have been going well and could finish ahead of schedule on Sunday.

"By Neil PriorBBC News The boy of seven or eight, who could not speak English or Welsh, washed up on the north Wales coast with his brother between 1743 and 1745. Named Evan Thomas, he was adopted by a doctor and went on to show bone setting skills never seen before in the UK. Now a DNA study has revealed he came from the Caucasus Mountains. The boys' dark skin and foreign language led people to believe they were Spanish - a myth which went on for hundreds of years. Evan's brother survived only a few days, but he went on to demonstrate he already possessed bone setting skills, including the first recorded use in Britain of traction and splints to pull apart the over-lapping edges of breaks and immobilise limbs while healing took place. 'Heavily influenced' Analysis of DNA from the 13th generation of Evan's descendants is now indicating that the brothers came from an area of the Caucasus Mountains, including Georgia, Ossetia and Southern Russia. Anglesey bone setter DNA project director John Rowlands said: ""When we embarked on the project, all the historical evidence seemed to point to Spain as being the most likely origins of Evan Thomas. ""Not only was there his exotic appearance and language, but also the fact that many Spanish ships were sailing past Wales at the time of the shipwreck, in order to supply troops in support of the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland. ""But early on in the analysis we were able to rule out British or Spanish descent, and now, after studying 300 gigabytes of data, our team at Edinburgh University have found 48 out of 51 points of similarity with DNA originating in the Caucasus. ""It's not yet a perfect match, but you can definitely say that their background was heavily influenced by this region. ""It may be that their family moved away before the boys were shipwrecked, but if so it wasn't more than a generation or so before."" Wherever his DNA came from, Evan Thomas clearly had a profound effect on his descendants as for the next 12 generations, at least one of them worked in orthopaedics. Hit the headlines His great-grandson, Hugh Owen Thomas, earned himself the epithet of The Father of Modern Orthopaedics, after inventing a collar to treat osteo-tuberculosis, a wrench for reducing dislocations, and a splint, which greatly reduced deaths from fractures among late 19th Century Liverpool dockers. However, it was his nephew, Sir Robert Jones - Evan's great-great-grandson - who would demonstrate the true potential of the Thomas splint - using it on the Western Front, to reduce fracture deaths from 80% in 1916, to just 8% by the end of World War I. Sir Robert also hit the headlines in 1896 when he became the first doctor to use X-rays to diagnose a fracture, and was the co-founder of the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital in Gobowen, Shropshire. But Dafydd Evans, from Anglesey, the man whose DNA helped unravel Evan Thomas's secret, has said previously that the family legacy may finally be coming to an end. His sister is a radiologist, and a cousin is a doctor, but he is a retired head teacher. According to Mr Rowlands, the hunt for a more precise origin goes on. ""It may be that there's a hiatus for months, or even years now, until a DNA sample turns up, which has more than 48 points of similarity. ""But we're on the system now, and sooner or later a closer match will emerge which is something we're all very excited about.","DNA mapping has shed light on a 260-year-old mystery of the origins of a child shipwrecked on Anglesey, who helped shape medical history."
"Staff at Abergavenny's Nevill Hall Hospital also failed to tell him that he may have developed cancer and fitted a catheter when he was not incontinent. The acting public services ombudsman upheld the complaint by the man's widow that her husband's care was compromised. Aneurin Bevan Health Board apologised. But a deaf charity says it knows of many similar cases despite guidelines over NHS care for deaf or blind people. The Welsh government is bringing in new rules aimed at ensuring people in Wales who are deaf or blind are not at a disadvantage when they need healthcare. And in February BBC Wales revealed that health boards were breaching equality laws. In upholding the complaint against Aneurin Bevan Health Board, Prof Margaret Griffiths agreed the health board had failed to follow record keeping procedures. The man, known as Mr W as his family have chosen to remain anonymous, was admitted to the hospital for a time in September 2011 with a possible chest infection and then again the following month, where he died. His widow, Mrs W, complained that her husband's care was compromised because staff did not consider his deafness, even though she told them about it. The family was also not told of a cancer diagnosis while he was in hospital, with them only learning of it later from their GP, she said. The woman said her husband was given a catheter - something she thought he would consider ""humiliating"" - even though he was not incontinent. She complained that she thought her husband was catheterised for the convenience of staff. Her husband fell while trying to walk to the toilet because he did not like the catheter and there were no rails around his bed to prevent such a fall. Acting Public Services Ombudsman for Wales Prof Margaret Griffiths found the health board failed to: She said: ""In any clinical situation it is clearly important to identify whether or not a person is able to hear and, if not, to identify a suitable way to communicate properly with them."" Richard Williams, of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru, said the charity has heard of many similar cases. 'Massive barrier' He said: ""Sadly, there are real problems deaf people in Wales face accessing services. ""We do come across cases similar to this, not necessarily with such horrific outcomes. ""It's very common amongst our members. Access to health services is one of their biggest concerns. ""It's quite routine that the health service is able to communicate with people only by telephone, which is a massive barrier for deaf people."" Aneurin Bevan Health Board has offered an unreserved apology to the family of Mr W and told them of the actions it has taken. A spokesperson said: ""Whilst no specific recommendation was made with regards to deaf awareness training our staff are expected to make ""reasonable adjustments"" for people who are deaf under the Equality Act (2010). ""We have been setting up specific training for staff to improve their communication skills when caring for patients who are deaf, or may have difficulty with their hearing.""","An 80-year-old deaf man was treated as if he had dementia by nurses because no-one had written down he had hearing problems, a health watchdog has found."
"Enabling work has started on the new Jedburgh Intergenerational Learning Campus. It involves stripping topsoil, moving earthworks and the construction of a large retaining wall.

"The incident happened in Clydebank on Thursday afternoon, when the pensioner returned to her flat. While she was distracted by one suspect, another is believed to have ransacked her bedroom and made off with the cash. After the man left, the woman realised the money was gone and contacted the police. She told them that she was followed into her close at Milton Mains Court by a man with a clipboard. She believed he was a workman, and he later came to her door claiming to be an employee of the water board. Despicable crime He told her there was a problem with her drains, and asked to come in to her flat. Police believe that while he distracted her in the kitchen, his accomplice - who had been spotted with him outside - came in and ransacked her bedroom. He made off with what police describe as a low four-figure sum of cash that he took from her purse. Officers described the suspect with the clipboard as in his 40s, with a stocky build. He was wearing a fawn hat, light-coloured clothing and work boots. The suspect who is believed to have raided the pensioner's bedroom is thought to be a younger man. Det Sgt Fiona Macarthur, of Police Scotland, said it was ""a despicable crime"". She added: ""It is absolutely vital that we trace these abhorrent individuals and I would appeal to anyone who noticed men matching the above descriptions loitering in the area, or even answered the door to one of them, to please get in touch. She urged the public to be vigilant and to verify the identity of people before letting them into their homes.","An 89-year-old woman had more than Â£1,000 stolen after falling prey to a bogus caller scheme."
"By Steffan MessengerBBC Wales Environment Correspondent ""I can remember he held the gun to [the cow's] head and she reached out to sniff the end of it,"" Ms Reader said. ""It fired and she dropped to the ground. To watch that so graphicallyâ¦ you feel like you've failed the herd."" Lethal injections will now be funded by ministers so farmers can avoid witnessing gun slaughter. They will be able to request the alternative to shooting for cows deemed unfit to travel, either because they are heavily in calf, have recently calved, or for welfare reasons. Latest figures show 11,977 cattle in Wales were slaughtered due to bovine TB in the 12 months to April 2019 - a 19% increase on the previous year, and the highest number of slaughtered cattle in 10 years. Ms Reader knows too well the horror of seeing infected animals shot. She has a herd of 200 cows in Wenvoe in the Vale of Glamorgan, supplying milk to one of the big supermarkets, but recently received the ""horrendous"" news that 10 had tested positive for bovine TB. ""It's spread by touch, so it could be everywhere and I feel a bit helpless,"" she said. ""I know farmers who have lost hundreds of cows and seen hundreds shot - and to see them shot again and again and again and to know that it's going to keep coming back and repeating on you is destroying."" Dairy farmer Ms Reader, who is vice chair of NFU Cymru's Milkboard, believes the focus needs to be on eradicating TB, ""to stop farmers suffering"". ""It's sometimes very hard on the farm to understand if anyone is doing anything other than sending out words such as 'oh we'll look at better ways of killing them'. It doesn't help when you're stood here living with it,"" she added. Farmers are compensated for cattle killed, but often, as in Ms Reader's case, it means an end to bloodlines bred over many decades. They also face strict restrictions on moving, buying or selling animals - and have less milk or beef to sell. The number of cattle killed in Wales as a result of bovine TB has risen sharply in recent years, which the Welsh Government insisted is down to heightened surveillance as it tries to stamp out the disease. Since 2009, it said there has been a 40% reduction in new cases. The latest figures show 722 new herd incidents in Wales - cases of TB in herds that were previously clear of the disease - a 7% decrease on the previous year and down from 1,314 in April 2009. Rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths announced in April that she had asked officials to look at ways of reducing instances where cattle had to be shot on farm, which can be ""particularly distressing to witness"". The Welsh Government added: ""Support is available to farmers and farming families in Wales impacted by TB breakdowns through the Cymorth TB programme."" What is the reaction? NFU Cymru President John Davies said: ""Unfortunately bovine TB will keep negatively impacting cattle and farming families in Wales until this horrendous disease is brought fully under control."" The Farmers' Union of Wales called for ""robust, Welsh-specific information on the financial impact of a TB breakdown and the subsequent mental health impacts on farmers"". Welsh Conservative rural affairs spokesman, Andrew RT Davies AM, said: ""At the best of times, farming can often prove a lonely business and has one of the highest suicide rates of any profession in this country."" Plaid Cymru's agriculture spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said there was ""utter frustration"" among farmers that the Welsh Government was not using all the tools available to tackle the problem. 'A hugely significant discovery' As cattle farmers deal with the fall out of the disease, scientists at the Bovine TB Centre of Excellence at Aberystwyth University have announced what they claimed could be a hugely significant discovery in the fight against the disease. Working with an international team of researchers, they have developed a test which can - for the first time - tell the difference between a vaccinated animal and one which has the infection. It could mean that cattle can be vaccinated against TB in future, though it will be several years before the test is ready to be deployed. Professor Glyn Hewinson, who heads up the European and Welsh Government-funded centre, said: ""The hope is that by bringing more evidence and science to the problem we can eradicate it.""","When three of Abi Reader's pregnant cows tested positive for bovine TB, they had to be shot on the farm, as they could not travel to an abattoir."
"By Marie-Louise Connolly & Louise CullenBBC News NI health team Some were being treated for blood disorders. A member of staff on the ward is also affected. Others have been sent home to self-isolate, and the ward has been closed to new admissions. It is the second confirmed outbreak at the hospital, which treated the highest number of Covid-19 patients in NI during the height of the pandemic. The BBC understands two nurses and a junior doctor from the Respiratory Emergency Department have also tested positive, while another 20 colleagues are isolating. Most of those staff members have been tested, with the majority of results coming back negative. Infection control experts have been at the hospital site on Tuesday. It is understood there is no identifiable link between the two clusters. 'Rising again' The Southern Health and Social Care Trust said one member of staff on the haematology ward had tested positive and three ""close staff contacts"" were self-isolating as a precaution. The trust also confirmed 12 patients on the ward had been tested for Covid-19 - five of them tested positive and one further haematology in-patient was also identified. ""Trust staff are working closely with the Public Health Agency to manage the situation and the safety of both patients and staff remains a priority,"" the trust said. ""There will be no routine visiting to the ward until further notice unless in exceptional circumstances. ""Covid-19 is rising again in our community. We urgently appeal to everyone to wash their hands, cover their face maintain social distancing."" The families of patients are being contacted by the trust. 'Wider implications' Dr Sara Hedderwick, a consultant in infectious disease at the trust, said they were ""spending a significant amount of time"" ensuring the affected patients were as safe as possible. ""It has meant in the first instance we will have to restrict our visiting to that area, which is obviously hugely upsetting for the patients on the ward,"" she said. ""It will have wider implications for our haematology patients who were expecting to be admitted in the future."" Dr Hedderwick said the pandemic had not gone away. ""As the winter comes back I think we're going to see more and more and more of these clusters in lots of places - hospitals being one of them,"" she said. ""We don't know who's got Covid - up to 40% of people with Covid don't really show any symptoms ""We know people can walk Covid on to our hospital site, they can be a patient, they can be a staff member and as we've allowed visitors to go back, increasingly it could be a visitor."" 'Over and over again' Forty-seven new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Northern Ireland in the past 24 hours by the Department of Health, bringing the overall tally to 6,823. No new deaths were reported on Tuesday's statistical bulletin from the department. Health Minister Robin Swann said Northern Ireland was ""walking a tightrope"" in the balance to restart society amid rising cases of Covid-19. He told the Stormont press briefing that public messaging about safety measures was as vital today as it ever was and the advice remained ""a matter of life and death"". ""Our concern is some of you are getting fed up listening to it and getting tired following it,"" he told the news conference. ""Complacency is our enemy. ""I hope you'll forgive me for repeating the messages, over and over again."" The minister hailed the success of the Department of Health's StopCOVID NI app, which he says has been downloaded more than 300,000 times. Mr Swann says 237 exposure notifications have been issued to those who would have been in close proximity with someone who had tested positive for the virus. ""A number of these would certainly have been missed by the tracing teams were it not for our app,"" he explained. In the Republic of Ireland, 92 new cases of Covid-19 were reported on Tuesday; there were no further deaths linked to the virus.",Five patients on the haematology ward at Craigavon Area Hospital have tested positive for Covid-19.
"The move at Clifton Nursing Home follows recent inspections by the care home regulator, the RQIA. The health minister said the relocation was being handled in consultation with residents and their families. ""Given the current situation facing care homes with Covid-19, decisive action is essential,"" said Robin Swann on Friday. Health trusts had started to contact families about moving residents to other suitable homes as soon as possible, said Mr Swann. He added: ""The concerns about the home relate in part to its management of a Covid-19 outbreak."" The RQIA has had ongoing concerns for some time about the home, which is operated by Runwood Homes. Death numbers falling On Friday, the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) reported that, for the second week in a row, coronavirus-related deaths in care homes had fallen. In the week to 15 May, there were 32 deaths in care homes, a fall from 38 the previous week, Nisra reported. Almost half of the deaths Nisra has recorded in Northern Ireland have happened in care homes The health minister said: ""It needs to be stressed that a large majority of care homes in Northern Ireland do not have Covid-19 outbreaks. ""Where homes do have outbreaks, they are working closely with trusts, the Public Health Agency and RQIA to appropriately manage the situation. Referring to the relocation at Clifton Nursing Home, Mr Swann continued: ""If a home's response is inadequate, action will be taken - as has happened in this case.""",Residents are being relocated from a Belfast care home amid concerns about its handling of a Covid-19 outbreak.
"Officers will be patrolling ""known locations"" where the small aircraft could be flown. Ch Supt Kenny MacDonald said ensuring the safety of the thousands expected to see in the New Year was vital. Hogmanay events are being kicked off on Sunday with pipe, drum and dance bands leading the annual Torchlight Procession. Other highlights over the three days include the famous Street Party, the Concert in the Gardens and a ceilidh in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle. More than 160,000 people are expected to descend on Scotland's capital for the various outdoor gatherings. It is illegal for unmanned aircraft to be flown within 150m (492ft) of a congested area or a large group of people. To comply with that rule, a no-fly zone is in force during the Hogmanay celebrations. In the UK, legislation came into force in July, making it illegal to fly a drone within 1km (0.62 miles) of an airport. It is also illegal to fly a drone higher than 400ft (120m). Public safety Before the Christmas holiday drone activity led to flights to and from London's Gatwick Airport being grounded. About 1,000 flights were affected during the airport's 36 hours of chaos. Ch Supt MacDonald told BBC Scotland: ""Our position remains the same as it has done in previous years where there is a no fly zone in place for both the torchlight event and the street party and that is really about public safety to make sure there are no drones flying over particularly crowded areas of the event. ""Legally they [drone operators] would be committing an offence. We have observers in place both for crowd dynamics but they will also be looking out for drones and we also have officers who will be patrolling known locations where potentially drones could be flown from."" Organisers are hoping the festivities will be be problem-free. Thousands are expected to be entertained by Scottish singer Stephanie Cheape who will headline the finale of the Torchlight Procession, ahead of fireworks from Calton Hill at 21:00. Other events include; To mark the year of Brexit, six Scottish writers were asked to each write a love letter to Europe with these then projected onto iconic buildings and landmarks around Edinburgh animated by a range of different composers and projection artists. Charlie Wood and Ed Bartlam, directors of Edinburgh's Hogmanay said: ""The Torchlight Procession is an iconic event in Scotland's annual calendar enjoyed by tens of thousands of people as the opening of Edinburgh's Hogmanay. ""After last year's successful change of route to weave through the Old Town and its blazing finale celebrating the voice of Scotland's young people we are thrilled that this year's procession culminates in the torchbearers creating the outline of Scotland with sculptures chosen by Scotland's young people at the heart of the display, marking the end of its highly successful Year of Young People. ""This year's Edinburgh's Hogmanay has a fantastic line-up of events for young and old under the banner We Love You, a celebration of Scotland's long-standing cultural ties with Europe. ""From our Concert in the Gardens headliner Franz Ferdinand to Carlos Nunez at the McEwan Hall, Massaoke at Bairns Afore to Gerry Cinnamon and Snap! at the Street Party, and the Loony Dook to our six writers creating love letters to Europe in Message from the Skies across the city, the programme is diverse, exciting and fresh.""",Edinburgh Hogmanay revellers have been warned by police not to use drones to film the street celebrations.
"A purpose-built extension has been attached to the eastern corner of the existing building, which is the longest medieval cathedral in Europe. It took the cathedral's stonemasons a year to construct the limestone attachment, which will provide storage, a new boiler and its first toilets. The Â£820,000 needed for the work was raised by the Friends of Winchester Cathedral. The building was opened by the Abbot of Fleury from L'Abbaye de St-BenÃ´it-sur-Loire in France who has been installed as an Honorary Canon. Journey of faith Dean of Winchester, The Very Reverend James Atwell said: ""This is a moment of history. It is very exciting for us that the Abbot of Fleury will be our first Ecumenical Canon. ""Following on from the Pope's visit nationally, it is evidence of the respect with which we hold one another and the acknowledgement of our shared journey of faith."" The link between Winchester Cathedral and the Abbey of Fleury goes back to 1978, when the then Dean of Winchester, Michael Stancliffe, and the Abbot of Fleury decided that the Anglican cathedral and the Benedictine monastery should be united in prayer. The cathedral and the abbey pray for each other every day. There are also regular exchanges between the two communities - including trips by the cathedral choir. The cathedral sits on the site of an early Christian church. The building began its growth in the 10th Century, gradually expanding to today's prominent landmark. In the early 1900s, huge cracks started to appear. There were fears that the east end of the building would collapse, after centuries of subsidence. Deep-sea diver, William Walker, worked under water in total darkness for six years placing bags of concrete to stabilise the building.",Winchester Cathedral has opened its first addition in 500 years.
"Belle Vue studios in Manningham, Bradford, documented people's lives from the 1920s until it closed in 1975. After it closed many images were dumped in a skip before being rescued. During the search for people shown in the images some of the photos were displayed at a Ukrainian club, a bus drivers' canteen and also a Windrush celebration event in the city. The studio's old-fashioned technique had used a Victorian camera and daylight to produce a glass plate negative. Eventually more than 17,000 of them were saved and more than 10,000 have so far been digitised. Tim Smith, a photographer and former Bradford museum curator who helped save the collection, said the pictures were ""unique nationally"" and showed a ""city's population frozen in time"". However, the names of the people in almost all the portraits were a mystery - though now some have been found. Sisters Orysia Fletcher and Irene Diakiw found long-forgotten family portraits were among the pictures displayed at Bradford Ukrainian Club. Orysia, now 67, said: ""Once a year we used to have to go and have a family photo taken and those photos would be sent to our grandparents in Ukraine, so they had an update as in those days no one had cameras."" Older sister Irene, 69, said: ""It was usually Easter time when we got new clothes because that was a tradition."" More stories from Yorkshire Carol Peltier found a series of family pictures when she attended a Windrush commemoration in Bradford city centre. ""This is a picture of me at one and a half years old, I had a very happy childhood and it brings back loads of memories,"" she said.. ""Lovely memories and some sadness because both my mum and dad are not here anymore."" Kulvinder Randhawa read a BBC story about the search and has been reunited with portraits of her family. ""There are no family photographs from that era, so it was really nice seeing they had been preserved. ""We celebrated my mum's birthday earlier this year by giving her a copy of the photo because it was lost to the family."" A picture of prefects from Belle Vue Boys School on Manningham Lane, that was close to the studio, has also reunited two of the group almost 50 years after the picture was taken. The sitters that day included Ali Rashid, now a TV executive but then the deputy head boy of the school, and Paul Bayes, now the Anglican Bishop of Liverpool. Bishop Bayes said: ""This is the prefect's committee of the school and every year there was a school magazine and the photo went on the inside page. ""We were a bunch of people who thought the world was at our feet and indeed so it was. Look what happened to us.""

"By Chris MorrisReality Check correspondent, BBC News That's because leaving the EU - with or without a deal - is currently the default. If the prime minister fails to get a deal through the House of Commons, the UK will leave with no deal at all unless something changes, because leaving the EU is written into UK law. The EU Withdrawal Act sets 29 March as the date of departure. The wording of the act does allow a minister to change the definition of ""exit day"" relatively quickly using a statutory instrument - a piece of secondary legislation - rather than an entirely new act of Parliament that would need to be debated. A minister would have to propose the change and MPs would have to approve it. Article 50 But there is a second and more significant reason why no deal would become the default position: that's what EU law says. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. The most obvious way therefore to stop a no-deal Brexit, or any form of Brexit, is to revoke Article 50. The European Court of Justice has ruled the UK can do that on its own, without asking the other 27 countries, and stay a member of the EU on its current terms - including opting-out of key policies, and keeping the budget rebate. But it seems highly unlikely that the House of Commons would vote to revoke Article 50 unless there had been another referendum, or maybe an election, in which the public backed the UK remaining in the EU. The government rejects the idea of holding another referendum anyway - and the time to do so before the end of March has run out. Extending Article 50 So, the other way to avoid a no-deal Brexit in the short term is to play for time and extend the Article 50 period. The government would need to propose that and MPs would have to approve it. But, crucially, unlike in the case of revoking Article 50, to extend it the UK would also need the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. It would probably need to persuade them that something important had changed in UK politics to warrant an extension - perhaps a looming election, or another referendum, rather than more of the same argument. One of the constraints for the rest of the EU is that European elections will take place at the end of May and the new European Parliament (without UK MEPs if Brexit has taken place) is due to meet for the first time in July. The only other circumstance in which a brief extension to Article 50 would probably be approved by the EU is if there had been a vote in favour of Theresa May's deal but a little more time was needed to dot the ""i""s and cross the ""t""s. But if Article 50 was extended without a deal passing the House of Commons, no deal would still remain the default outcome at the end of the extended negotiating period. So what else can MPs do for now? In a word, amendments. An amendment to the Finance Bill, limiting the Treasury's ability to make no-deal preparations unless authorised by Parliament, was backed by MPs by 303 to 296 votes. This amendment will make it ""harder for the government to drift into no deal without Parliament being able to direct it"", according to Labour MP Yvette Cooper. A cross-party coalition of MPs against no deal is now flexing its muscles, and what we're likely to see over the next couple of months is what some are calling ""guerrilla warfare by amendment"" in the House of Commons. The trade bill is likely to be another target - it would be needed in the event of no deal, to try to keep the UK trading on the same terms as it has now with the rest of the world. The idea behind all this parliamentary manoeuvring is to demonstrate that there is a clear majority in the House of Commons against no deal. But none of it, taken in isolation, will prevent the Article 50 clock ticking away until it stops at the end of March. 'Indicative votes' That's why a growing number of MPs support the idea of holding a series of ""indicative votes"" on different potential outcomes, to try to find an alternative to no deal that would enjoy broad (or even sufficient) support. Senior MPs argue that the government would be unable to ignore the political pressure if the will of the House of Commons was clearly expressed on numerous occasions. But political pressure is not the same as legal reality. Three ministers have said publicly they would resign if the government pursued a no-deal strategy, while others are thought to hold the same position in private. A handful of backbench MPs have said they would quit the party. The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, is understood to have told cabinet that history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country. But if the prime minister did decide to press on regardless, it may well be that the only way MPs could stop a no-deal Brexit at the last moment would be to vote down the government itself. UPDATE - This article was updated on Wednesday 9 Jan to include the new amendment asking government to return to Parliament with new plans within three days of a vote against the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter",There's a big problem facing members of Parliament who want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. They can't just show there is a majority in the House of Commons against no deal - they need to prove there is a majority in favour of an alternative outcome.

"Between 1 March and 15 April, North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust (NWAFT) discharged 273 people to care homes, 39 of whom were tested. The trust runs Peterborough City Hospital, Hinchingbrooke Hospital and Stamford and Rutland Hospital. The trust has said it was following guidance at the time. On 15 April national guidance changed and instructed hospitals to test patients prior to discharging them to care homes. The figures from NWAFT, given in response to a Freedom of Information request by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, found 234 people discharged to care homes were not tested.

He said he had tried to consider why he had shot Mr Bidve but there were ""no answers, so I just forgot about it [and] never thought about it again"". He also told the court about the teardrop tattoo he had inked on to his face two days after the shooting. Asked by Mr Csoka as to why he got the tattoo, Mr Stapleton said his friends ""suggested to me I should get a teardrop because it's a symbol that you've killed someone"". He was also asked why, at his first appearance in front of magistrates in January, he had given his name as ""Psycho Stapleton"". He said it was because ""that's what the police were calling me so I thought that's what I'd say"". Mr Stapleton has admitted manslaughter due to diminished responsibility, but his plea was not accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service. The trial continues.","The man accused of murdering Indian student Anuj Bidve has told Manchester Crown Court that he ""didn't even know where I shot the guy""."
"James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent@BBCJLandaleon Twitter In recent decades there have been the bitter battles over Europe. But now China is taking its place in the corridors of Westminster as the defining external issue de nos jours. Across the green benches the mood against China appears to be hardening, in part because of the way Beijing handled the coronavirus pandemic, but also now as a result of its plans to impose tough new security laws in Hong Kong. There are new groups being formed by Conservative MPs, such as the China Research Group, pushing for a more robust line. Networks of MPs are being set up on Whatsapp to coordinate strategies. Dean Godson, director of the centre-right think tank, Policy Exchange argues that different wings of the Conservative Party are coming together to demand a tougher line on the People's Republic of China. This coalition of what he calls ""PRC-sceptic"" MPs includes: pro-American MPs who fear a UK/US trade deal could be threatened unless Britain matches President Trump's hostility to China; human rights advocates concerned about its treatment of Uighur Muslims; liberal internationalists disturbed by China's challenge to the global rules based order; new MPs in the north of England anxious about factories damaged by China's anti-competitive practises. 'Golden era' All this - plus the urgings of an increasingly China-hostile White House - is putting pressure on the UK government to harden its line. Some MPs want Downing Street to ditch - or at least water down significantly - its plans to give the Chinese technology giant Huawei a partial role in the development of the UK's 5G network. Other Tory MPs are looking for a tougher response on Hong Kong. And now, in the wake of what many MPs see as China's mishandling of the pandemic - its initial attempted cover-up, its subsequent aggressive ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy - there are also growing calls for a more fundamental rethink of Britain's strategy towards China. But this growing China-scepticism is not shared by all and will be resisted. The Conservatives are led by a prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has been instinctively supportive of engagement with China. As London Mayor, he was a vocal advocate of David Cameron's efforts to create a ""golden era"" in UK/China relations. 'Scapegoat' As Foreign Secretary, he never failed to remind Chinese visitors how his daughter was learning Mandarin. In an interview broadcast by Phoenix Television in Hong Kong last summer, the future prime minister said. ""We're interested in what President Xi is doingâ¦we are very pro-China."" Some Conservative MPs are concerned about what they see as a new sinophobic tone from colleagues. ""They are being a little bit swivel-eyed and alarmist,"" said one. ""I am not sure how much they really understand China."" These MPs fear the anti-China mood gripping both sides in the US presidential election is beginning to infect British politics too. Richard Graham MP, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary China Group, said: ""It might be tempting for everyone to want to treat China as a new national scapegoat, just as the EU was a convenient scapegoat in recent years. ""But it is not the most important thing in the minds of our constituents. The most important thing is going to be jobs. And in that sense, having a strong partnership with China makes absolute sense."" Climate change So perhaps the biggest obstacle to the growing tide of China-scepticism will be the huge economic downturn expected to follow the pandemic. Some MPs believe the UK will not be able to afford a political battle with Beijing just when it will need Chinese investment to kick start the economy. Some sources say this concern is shared at the top of the Treasury and the Foreign Office. It is worth remembering that for many Brexiteers, part of the post-EU ""global Britain"" vision involved much greater trade with China. Other Conservatives MPs argue it would be unwise for Britain to disengage with a country that is central to most global issues. Take climate change. 'Constructive engagement' China is both the largest emitter of carbon and the biggest investor in renewable energy. If Britain wants the COP26 summit in Glasgow next year to be a success in setting a new path for the world's climate, then China, they argue, will have to be part of the deal. Sir Simon Macdonald, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office, told the Foreign Affairs committee last month: ""No problem that the world faces today can be addressed - still less solved - without the active participation of China. China is critical across the full policy waterfront."" There will be countervailing pressures, too, from the Labour Party. The new shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, told me: ""While parts of the Conservative Party sound increasingly hawkish about China, the economic fallout from COVID-19 will undoubtedly leave the UK looking to Beijing for investment. ""What is lacking is a coherent China strategy across government departments that allows for constructive engagement on shared challenges and priorities but gives us a greater degree of strategic independence. Ramping up the rhetoric is no substitute for a strategy."" Tougher rhetoric So how might the government respond to these different pressures? Even before coronavirus broke out, officials had recognised that policy on China needed better coordination and had set up a new cross-government unit at the Foreign Office to do just that. This unit may be beefed up further. There will be tougher language and rhetoric designed to placate the backbenches. Ministers will act to make Britain less strategically dependent on China. The government will try to reduce the length of supply chains and diversify its sources and markets, not just for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, but also technology and other strategic sectors. There will be greater protection to stop UK firms being snapped up by Chinese conglomerates. Closer alliances The prime minister hinted at this in the Commons this week, saying he was ""concerned about the buying up of UK technology now by countries that may have ulterior motives, and we are certainly introducing measures to protect our technological base."" Much of this will not be targeted at China specifically but given cover as part of a broader attempt to improve the UK's strategic resilience. The pressure to limit Huawei's investment in UK 5G even further may be impossible to resist. There will also be an attempt to forge closer alliances with like-minded countries so any pressure on China can be coordinated. ""We don't need to out-compete China, we have to out-collaborate China,"" one Whitehall source said. Lord Hague, the former foreign secretary, argues the trick will be for ministers to find a way of increasing Britain's strategic independence while also establishing a new framework for engaging with China. One very senior UK official told me: ""We need to find a route between the 'evil empire' and 'project kowtow'."" But with the government facing competing pressures from Washington, Beijing and the backbenches of Westminster, finding that route will be no easy task.",Rare is the day when some vexed foreign question does not grip British politics.
"Thomas Kirwan, 23, died near the Uberra Club on 8 July. A number of other people were also injured. Mr Kirwan's manager, Adrian Ward, said more than one hundred people attended his funeral at St Peter and St Paul's Church in Wolverhampton on Friday. Mr Ward said staff from Bridgnorth Aluminium were given time off to go. 'Absolute gentleman' He said: ""There was a really good turn out, around 30 of our staff went and there must have been a hundred people gathered outside the church. ""His murder was terrible, everybody is still numbed by it all - Thomas was superb and an absolute gentleman. ""It's tragic and there's nothing else you can say about it."" Five people, four men and a woman, arrested in connection with the death have been bailed by police. Mr Kirwan was planning to marry his girlfriend of six years, 21-year-old Jade Elwell, next year.

"Gary Gillespie forecast ""all forms of EU exit"" would lead to lower household incomes than continued EU membership. He argued the Scottish economy would be Â£1,600 per head worse off by 2030 if the UK government strikes a free trade deal with Europe. If no deal is reached, that would rise to a Â£2,300 shortfall. A free trade agreement is the preferred outcome of the UK government. The report also argued that the Scottish economy had been dominated by Brexit uncertainty in recent years, contributing to growth being ""significantly below trend"". It said the UK's departure from the EU had hit businesses and affected economic growth. Sluggish growth According to Mr Gillespie's report, growth is expected to continue to be sluggish over this year as the future relationship with the EU remains undecided. Following the announcement of the draft Budget at Holyrood last week, the Scottish Fiscal Commission forecast 1% growth in 2020 and 1.1% growth in 2021. Growth in 2019 had been forecast at 1.2%, but the economy actually grew by 0.9%. The report said: ""The official and independent forecasts for the Scottish economy suggest growth of around 1% in 2020, rising slightly over the next few years, which is broadly in line with recent annual growth in productivity. ""As noted, this may be stronger than 2019 but is likely to remain below trend as the economy transitions to whatever new trade arrangements materialise for 2021 and beyond.""","Much of the impact of Brexit has yet to be felt on the Scottish economy, according to a report by the government's chief economist."
"The ""Manchester Zoo"" project is being developed by Johnpaul Houston who is in advanced talks with Trafford Council. Mr Houston, a former assistant head keeper at Blackpool Zoo, hopes to be able to announce the precise location of the site by the end of April. He hopes the zoo will open by the end of 2021, while an education centre for schools could be completed next year. Discover more news from around the North West Mr Houston, 32, from Ormskirk, told the BBC he had managed to secure private funding for the zoo, which will cost at least Â£8m to get up and running. ""I think people just get so inspired by zoos and nature,"" he said. ""Zoos are ultimately responsible for the conservation of species."" Mr Houston, who holds positions with a number of global zoological associations, said he had identified two potential sites for the zoo in Greater Manchester. One is about 90 acres in size while the other is about 250 acres. Describing it as a 20-year project, Mr Houston said the new zoo would need time to grow. If it gains planning permission, it would be the first zoo in Greater Manchester since the closure of Belle Vue Zoological Gardens in 1977. ""What we are trying to do is pretty different,"" said Mr Houston. ""Belle Vue closed because there was a new understanding of animals and how to keep them and the welfare standards probably weren't amazing. ""We're trying to create a much more naturalistic landscape for the animals and make them feels as though - at least in part - they can exhibit all of their natural behaviour which I don't think they were able to do [back] then."" Mr Houston said major emphasis would be placed on conservation, education and saving threatened species. Initially, he said, exotic species from Madagascar, lemurs and birds of prey would feature, with different animals added as the zoo develops. The project has already secured a partnership with a rainforest research centre based in Madagascar called Ampasy. A spokesman for Trafford Council said: ""Council officers have met with Mr Houston to discuss his proposals. We will continue to work with him in advance of any potential future planning application.""",A zoologist is finalising multimillion-pound plans to build a new zoo in Greater Manchester.
"By Ciara RiddellBBC News NI The 25-year-old from eastern Europe said she and other girls were kept short of food at a house in Belfast and were not allowed to wear clothes. She told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme she was only permitted to sleep for about two hours at a time. The victim said her experience had left her with physical and mental problems. ""The difference between selling a person for sexual exploitation and a butcher who sells meat, it is not different. It's the same thing,"" she said. 'Frequent beatings' She said a typical day would entail being wakened by someone beating her. She would then be dragged from wherever she was sleeping, ""probably on a sheet on a cold floor,"" and pushed into the shower. The victim said beatings were frequent and she had ""learned to keep quiet."" ""Food, you don't have. Probably the only thing you could use was water, at the sink or the bathroom,"" she said. ""If there is food, there is going to be a major row between all the girls who are kept there. ""You are not allowed to wear clothes, you have to stay naked in front of everybody. If you had clothes, the girls would try to take them from you. ""Meanwhile, you have to accept the people who are seeing you. They pay money before they even arrive. They hand you money, but pimps are standing at the door waiting for their money."" She said they were not allowed to sleep for longer than two hours. 'Mental problems' ""You reach a level where you cannot even walk,"" she said. The woman said her treatment had left her with serious back pains and mental problems. ""Head problems, like keeping things in my head because I was hit with the door on the head, and some interior organs. I cannot say more than that."" ""The only thing that keeps you alive is, you see a picture of the happiest memory in your life, and you hope that you are going to have freedom."" A human trafficking bill goes in front of a Stormont committee on Thursday. If it gets the go ahead, it will criminalise men who buy sex. The woman said she would welcome the bill, which is being brought by DUP MLA Lord Morrow. ""They (clients) think they pay for sexual services to that girl, but they don't pay the girl. They pay nothing. They pay the pimp to bring in more girls to change them,"" she said.

"It follows calls for changes to the Hunting Act amid claims that Cheshire Police was failing to crack down on illegal hunting. There has only been one prosecution for hunting in Cheshire since 2004. Cheshire Hunt Saboteurs say loopholes make prosecutions ""almost impossible"" while the Countryside Alliance wants more protection for landowners. 'Close loopholes' However, both sides told the meeting they were ""broadly happy"" with Cheshire Police's approach to the issue. Police are investigating whether any laws were broken following the death of a fox during a trail hunt in Huxley last month. In January 2018, Chester MP Chris Matheson said ""at least four foxes"" had been ""killed by trail hunts"". These were described as ""accidental"", by a hunt organiser. Better training The meeting held by Cheshire Police followed an independent review commissioned by Cheshire police crime commissioner David Keane which concluded it was difficult to ""secure sufficient evidence"" for convictions. Mr Keane said: ""There's a clear view there needs to be changes in the law."" Cheshire Chief Constable Darren Martland said better training would be given to officers as the issue was a ""priority"" which it took ""very seriously"". A spokesperson for Cheshire Hunt Saboteurs said over the last year the police force had worked with anti-fox hunting groups to deter illegal fox hunting. ""We feel the only way forward is for the Hunting Act to be strengthened... to close said loopholes."" She added they were pleased by steps taken by the force to improve policing of the Hunting Act and ""to discourage illegal hunting"". A member of an anti-hunt group, who identified herself only as Karen, said that having two officers dedicated to wildlife crime was not sufficient in a county that had three regular hunts. Legal hunts - hounds and riders riding an agreed route rather than chasing foxes - have complained of inadequate policing of protests. Polly Portwin of the Countryside Alliance which campaigns in favour of hunting, said the law needs to grant more protection to landowners against criminal damage and trespass. Fox hunting: What is the law?",Pro and anti-fox hunting campaigners in Cheshire have told a public meeting that the law needs strengthening.
"Zakari Bennett-Eko drowned in the River Irwell in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester in September 2019. His father, Zak Bennett-Eko, was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time, the jury was told. His defence argue that the 23-year-old defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity, the court sitting at Salford's Lowry theatre has heard. But the prosecution's case is that he is guilty of manslaughter by diminished responsibility, Rob Hall, prosecuting, said Mr Bennett-Eko's partner Emma Blood, who was eight months pregnant, told him on the day of Zakari's death that he needed to start looking after himself because she would not be able to care for two babies and him. He said: ""It may be that exchange set the seed in Zak's mind that they would be better off without Zakari. ""Zak would later claim at about this time he saw Zakari's legs expanding and that he, Zakari, was turning into the devil."" Mental health problems The court heard how Mr Bennett-Eko left the family home in River Street, Radcliffe, with his son in a pushchair. The jury was told Mr Bennett-Eko later said he passed two women with ""eyes like the devil"" and that they wanted him to drown his son. The court heard the defendant had suffered from mental health problems and, at 17, was sectioned and diagnosed with psychosis related to cannabis use. He began a relationship with Miss Blood in 2016 and in October 2018 Zakari was born. Mr Hall said, following Zakari's birth, the couple argued and Mr Bennett-Eko began to miss GP appointments and started to consume cannabis. The court heard Miss Blood messaged friends in September 2019 expressing concerns about his behaviour.

"The new bridge across the Forth, between Edinburgh and Fife, will remain closed for six days, with traffic diverted back to the Forth Road Bridge. Up to 50,000 people who won tickets will be allowed a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to walk on the crossing. They will walk over the bridge between 09:00 and 17:00 on Saturday and Sunday. The new bridge will then be officially opened by the Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, on Monday. On Tuesday, local schools and community groups will be allowed to walk on the bridge before it is permanently closed to pedestrians. The bridge will reopen to traffic in the early hours of Thursday 7 September. Stein Connolly, from Transport Scotland, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that there had been huge interest in the new bridge. ""We've had feedback that people have driven across it five times, that some families have got up out of their beds early and taken their kids across it before they went to school,"" he said. ""You've seen, with the queues yesterday, the interest in it, so we're now following this interest up by allowing 50,000 people to walk over it."" There will be a 40mph speed limit in place when the bridge reopens to traffic but this will be raised to 70mph in the coming weeks when the bridge will take the M90 motorway across the Forth. The new bridge, which opened to traffic for the first time on Wednesday, will take most of the 24 million vehicle journeys a year that currently use the existing Forth Road Bridge. The 53-year-old suspension bridge, which lies just hundreds of yards away, will be adapted to carry cycles, pedestrians and public transport such as buses. The decision to replace the old bridge was taken 10 years ago after corrosion was found in its cables causing the bridge to lose strength and creating concern that it could no longer carry such heavy loads.

"By Kelly-Leigh Cooper & Lee CostelloBBC News NI For decades the streets of Northern Ireland have been peppered with political murals depicting the region's religious divisions. But a new wave of contemporary mainstream art is emerging in some of Belfast's neglected and more up-and-coming areas. The art in the city's Cathedral Quarter has become so popular local art curator Adam Turkington now runs a tour around the area. ""There's over 100 pieces of street art within a very short walking distance,"" he said. ""I grew up in the Troubles. If you have environments where walls are political then public art becomes accentuated and more important. ""If you go to Berlin or Bethlehem, there is a real tradition of street art as an active protest against the political position of walls within communities. ""We already had a tradition of murals and writing on walls here, which is more often than not associated with division. So to create a body of work that is a counter narrative to that is really powerful. ""So much of the path to creating a shared cultural identity is creating visuals and architecture that everybody can take ownership of."" Many of the local artists who started as amateurs have now gained commercial contracts as Belfast's businesses aim to decorate their premises with their own commissioned stylised graffiti. Here are profiles of some of the faces behind some of the city's most striking artwork. Dean Kane (aka Visual Waste) Dean Kane (under his alias Visual Waste) specialises in pop culture designs, painting portraits of celebrities that have fast became local tourist attractions. He said:""I had a corporate job with a great salary but it bored me and I wasn't passionate about it. ""After I had my first kid I was going to go back to it, but I ended up walking in, writing my resignation on a napkin and heading straight to the job centre to register myself as self-employed. ""I started putting my work on social media and soon I was getting lots of commercial work. I started a website and then a video blog and it really raised my profile. ""Belfast is evolving, millennials aren't interested in all the political murals, they want something that means something to them. 'Street art actually communicates something' ""Street art communicates to a much broader age and social media allows its profile to be elevated to a whole new level where everyone has access to seeing it. ""Vandalism is when somebody just sticks their name on a wall but doesn't have any intention of actually saying something with any real meaning."" Eoin McGinn (aka Emic) Eoin McGinn from County Tyrone, is a street artist who decided that he had enough of 'normal' jobs after losing two in a month. He said: ""I come from a rural upbringing, but I moved to Manchester and then Belfast to study art. ""I loved all the art that comes with living in the city and it really inspired me to start it myself. 'I always thought that art looked better on walls than in galleries' ""Eventually a local newspaper did a feature on one of my pieces and it kind of just built from there. ""The political murals still have a place in Belfast because of its history, but my work is nothing like that, what I do is a blend of photo realism and abstraction."" Marian Noone (aka Friz) Marian Noone is originally from County Sligo, Ireland. ""I studied animation originally but never went into the industry,"" she said. She moved to Belfast 11 years ago, where she found and fell in love with spray painting: ""I paint, maybe subconsciously, powerful strong looking women."" ""I'm really inspired by nature and by Celtic mythology. It may not be totally accurate, but there's that kind of fantasy element where I take liberties. 'No other city' ""If I had been in any other city it wouldn't have happened as organically as it did in Belfast.""

""Right now I'm just doing it because I am passionate and I want to brighten up the city. ""Personally I am on benefits, so I want to get to a point where I can do this as a living.

"They also showed that 88% of the 17,395 were first-time buyers. Prime Minister David Cameron said the scheme, which is made up of two parts, was a key strand of the government's long-term economic plan. But Labour has warned that rising demand must be met with increased housing supply for people to afford it. According to the government's own figures, 77% of homes bought under the scheme as a whole were outside London and the South East. And the average value of a property bought through the initiative was Â£194,992. There are two parts to the Help to Buy scheme - the equity loan and the mortgage guarantee. With the equity loan, which was launched in England in April last year, in Scotland in September, and in Wales in January 2014, buyers can put down a deposit of just 5%. This has to be on a new build, and it enables them to take out a mortgage of up to 75% of the property's value. The difference is made up with an equity loan of up to 20% from the government. 'Security and independence' The mortgage guarantee, which began across the UK last October and will run until the end of 2016, offers a government guarantee against losses for lenders who are prepared to offer mortgages to people with only a small deposit. Almost 15,000 of the 17,395 homes bought through Help to Buy were done with the equity loan, the figures revealed. Use of the equity loan was at its highest in south-east England, while the highest number of people buying a home through the mortgage guarantee was in Scotland and north-west England. Mr Cameron hailed the scheme, saying: ""Help to Buy is a key part of our long-term economic plan, giving thousands more people the security and independence that comes from owning their own home."" 'Cost-of-living crisis' But shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds warned that new homes still need to be built. ""Any help for first time buyers struggling to get on the property ladder is to be welcomed,"" Ms Reynolds said. ""But rising demand for housing must be matched with rising supply if this scheme is to bring the cost of housing within the reach of low and middle-income earners. ""Instead, under this government house building fell to its lowest level in peacetime since the 1920s and home ownership continues to fall. ""You can't deal with the cost-of-living crisis without building more homes."" Ms Reynolds said the country needs a ""help to build"" policy to both boost housing supply and tackle the cost of living. She added that Labour was committed to getting at least 200,000 homes built a year by 2020. Other highlights in the government figures included:","More than 17,000 households bought homes under the government's Help to Buy scheme in its first nine months, figures have revealed."
"By Andrew SinclairBBC East political correspondent The Norfolk MPs fear the woman, who claims being drugged and sold by traffickers into prostitution, faces being killed if she is sent home.

South Norwich MP Clive Lewis said the MPs had taken advice from the Sue Lambert Trust, which provides support to survivors of sexual abuse. 'Sold into prostitution' ""They're concerned for her, we're concerned for her, she's concerned for herself and we feel that she has to stay in this country and that her application for asylum should be honoured,"" he said. The woman, whose name has not been revealed for her safety, said after she began feeling unwell, a group of people on the ferry offered to help her. Instead, she said, they drugged her and sold her into prostitution. After becoming pregnant, she managed to escape and hid on a lorry which brought her to Norwich where her daughter - now aged two - was born. Her claim for asylum was rejected last week and she could be deported soon. 'Honour killing' South Norfolk MP Richard Bacon told the Commons she was very vulnerable. ""She is now staying at her therapist's house in South Norfolk to reduce the risk of self-harm, and if she were deported to Albania... might be the victim of an 'honour killing',"" he said.

"Hackers have targeted Sunderland City Council with phishing and spoofing emails, and at least one Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Officers also experienced a ""spray attack"" where accounts were locked out after criminals repeatedly used common passwords to try to gain access.

The council's IT security breach was revealed in a scrutiny co-ordinating committee report, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Last year, the Local Government Association published a ""cyber-stocktake"" based on a questionnaire completed by councils. Sunderland received green and amber ratings in several areas, but was labelled red in technology standards and compliance and detection.

He was among 15 select committee chairs elected in a secret ballot. Other winners included Tom Tugendhat (foreign affairs), Tobias Ellwood (defence) and Julian Knight (culture). And former cabinet ministers Greg Clark and Karen Bradley will head the science and procedure committees respectively. A wide range of roles were up for grabs, with briefs ranging from transport to international trade. Mr Hunt said he was ""honoured"" to be elected as chair of the health select committee and he would be pressing the government to move quickly to build a cross-party consensus for a funding settlement for care for the elderly. There is a select committee for each governmental department, along with a few additional groups. They are made up of 11 or more members who carry out inquiries and create reports into a range of subjects. They are seen as one of the most effective ways of holding ministers and civil servants to account. The chairs of 13 committees, including education and home affairs, have already been named as the candidates for chairman ran uncontested. Wednesday's elections do not include the intelligence and security committee (ISC) - the head of which is chosen through a separate process, with nominations provided by the prime minister after consultation with the leader of the opposition. The long-awaited Russia report - into allegations of espionage, subversion and interference in UK democracy - will not be published until a new ISC is established. The timing of the committee's reconstitution is also in the gift of the PM. Fair representation Chairs of the committees are elected by MPs at the start of each Parliament. Parties agree on the allocation of committees between them to make sure the chairs are a fair representation of the make-up of Parliament. As Mr Johnson and his Conservatives won in December with an 80-strong majority, Tory MPs will chair 17 of them. Labour will head up nine, while the SNP will lead on two. The biggest competition was for chair of the defence committee, with five Tory candidates vying for the top job. Ex-defence minister Mr Ellwood saw off competition from Adam Holloway, Robert Courts, James Gray and Sir Bernard Jenkin. And incumbent Mr Tugendhat won the hotly contested race to head the foreign affairs committee, defeating Crispin Blunt and Bob Seely. The big Labour contest was for chair of the pensions committee, with Stephen Timms seeing off Debbie Abrahams, Chris Bryant and Karen Buck.",Ex-Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been elected to head a committee of MPs which scrutinises the performance of the NHS and government health policy.
"KRW Law made a submission to Surrey coroner Richard Travers after the BBC obtained papers about the case. A spokeswoman for Mr Travers said it was the coroner's intention to contact the families to allow them to make representations. She said a the review would be held, probably next year. Five died and 65 were injured in the IRA blasts but those responsible were never prosecuted and the inquests never concluded. The wrongfully-convicted Guildford Four served 15 years before release. KRW Law said its clients and families of the victims needed the truth. The law firm is representing a former soldier who survived the blast at the Horse & Groom and is still suffering from PTSD, and Ann McKernan, sister of wrongly-jailed Gerry Conlon who died in 2014. Guildford Four files 'must be released' Pub bombings inquests 'could be resumed' Soldiers Ann Hamilton, 19, Caroline Slater, 18, William Forsyth, 18, and John Hunter, 17, and plasterer Paul Craig, 21, all died in the blast at the Horse & Groom on 5 October 1974. The BBC has been in contact with the victims' families and friends, but most remain too traumatised to talk publicly. The Guildford Four",A pre-inquest review is to be held in the case of the IRA Guildford pub bombings after a legal bid by human rights lawyers.
"It was a working day for many of the 5,200 service personnel, now mostly based in the southern part of Helmand province, but there were carol concerts and exchanges of presents. A Christmas lunch was served at the UK headquarters in Camp Bastion and four smaller remote bases. There was also extra time for phone calls home and prayer. Some 447 British servicemen and women have lost their lives since operations began in 2001. The most recent death took place on Monday when a soldier from the Royal Engineers was killed after coming under enemy fire while on operations east of Kabul. 8,400 mince pies All UK combat operations are due to finish by the end of 2014, with responsibility transferred to Afghan forces. Afghan security forces are already leading operations, with British troops working alongside them. Prime Minister David Cameron told UK troops on a visit to Camp Bastion last week that their ""mission had been accomplished"". He said they had restored a basic level of security to Afghanistan and prevented it from becoming again what he called ""a haven for terror"". The 7th Armoured Brigade - the Desert Rats - which now command Britain's operation in Helmand - is ensuring that the troops still feel part of the Christmas celebrations, says BBC correspondent Karen Allen. At Camp Bastion and across the UK's area of operations, around 6,000 personnel enjoyed two tonnes of turkey, one and a quarter tonnes of gammon, half a tonne of Brussels sprouts and 8,400 mince pies. There were also Midnight Mass services in tented chapels, a half marathon in which runners wore everything from Christmas cracker bodysuits to Santa hats and a visit from Father Christmas to distribute presents. Brigadier James Woodham, the commander of Task Force Helmand, praised the focus and determination of the troops. ""The soldiers serving here this Christmas should be very proud of the work they are doing,"" he said. ""They are doing a fantastic job and when I speak to my Afghan counterparts, they are really thankful for the work, determination and investment that our soldiers have put in."" Senior Logistics Officer Major Luke Dance said: ""We have an important job to do here but we try to make sure that as many people as possible get to sit down and have a traditional Christmas lunch. ""It's a good morale boost and the small details help to bring a little bit of home to Afghanistan."" Thousands of personnel on ships or around the globe in Cyprus, the Falklands Islands and Gibraltar were also able to enjoy a Christmas meal.",British troops have marked their final Christmas in Afghanistan ahead of next year's scheduled pullout.
"Farmer Fraser Jones plans to build the dairy for 1,000 cattle at Leighton near Welshpool. Powys Council's planning committee said it was ""minded to approve"" the application subject to a report on ""outstanding issues"". The development is still opposed by a number of interested groups The planning committee members voted twice. The first vote saw six councillors in favour and five against. Obstacles The second vote was on a motion that ""the committee is minded to approve the application subject to a report coming back to committee on outstanding issues"". This was also passed by six votes to five. Afterwards Mr Jones said: ""I'm very excited and relieved. ""I've put a lot of hard work in, and my agents, to overcome a lot of obstacles, and I'm glad the councillors saw the sort of work we'd done to overcome the difficulties. ""We've got some conditions to meet, internal road access is the main one."" He added that he wanted the project to be a success and was willing to do what he could to make it so. Council officers had recommended that planning approval should be refused. Groundwater A council report said Mr Jones's application had been rigorously scrutinised, but concluded that the scale, location and impact of the development ""fundamentally conflicts"" with the development plan. It added that the parlour would have a visual impact locally on listed buildings, would affect views from nearby Powis Castle, and would impinge on Offa's Dyke. The Environment Agency raised concerns about groundwater and how manure would be managed after the project was first unveiled in August last year. Mr Jones said in February that he had addressed these worries after withdrawing a first application. The agency had no objections against the latest proposals, along with Powys environmental health services and Powysland Internal Drainage Board. But the development is still opposed by the Countryside Council for Wales, the historic monuments agency Cadw, the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, the National Trust and Powys Teaching Health Board, which is concerned about air quality. The council report said: ""The site is located within a vicinity which is sensitive in terms of its proximity to and its visual relationship (to) heritage assets including listed buildings, a registered landscape and a scheduled ancient monument."" Compassion in World Farming claimed last year that Mr Jones's plans were factory farming. He denied this and said his animals' health would be monitored all the time, and he claimed the dairy would improve milking conditions. But Mr Jones has said his cows will be inside for 250 days of the year. The council said it received a high number of objections to the original application, and an action group was formed locally. The planned dairy is next door to homes and a primary school.","Controversial plans for a ""super dairy"" in Powys are likely to be approved after councillors ignored advice to reject it."
"Tilbury port said it had been contacted by companies looking for an alternative to Felixstowe. The Port of Felixstowe said talk of diverting ships was not unusual. The Felixstowe Port Users' Association told the BBC that the situation was improving with 60% of containers being loaded within an hour. On Wednesday, lorry drivers complained of tailbacks of up to 16 hours after the IT system was introduced on Sunday. One shipping line, that did not wish to be named, told the BBC cranes that normally handled 24 containers an hour, were at present only handling about eight an hour. A spokesman from London Container Terminal in Tilbury said: ""We have been approached by a number of shipping lines seeking alternative options to Felixstowe."" Jason Flower, chairman of Felixstowe Port Users' Association said there were more vehicles getting off the port now. But he said there was ""still an issue with some containersâ¦ 20% of them are taking more than three hours and some are taking five hours"". He added: ""We are pressing the port to put more people on the service desk but it is better."" 'Stable and reliable' A spokesman for Felixstowe port operator Hutchison Ports said one or two ships may have been diverted, but diversions are not that unusual. He said earlier: ""The new system is operating across our container and rail terminals after a successful migration of data on Sunday."" The IT system is already in use at 25 Hutchison Ports around the world, the spokesman added. ""It will provide a stable, reliable and consistent level of performance for our customers for many years to come,"" he said. He thanked people using the port for their ""co-operation and understanding during this time"".","Shipping lines are looking at moving some business from the UK's biggest container port, which has been hit by delays caused by IT problems."
"Northumbria University conservators were working on a centuries-old panel by an unknown artist of the beheading of John the Baptist from the Bowes Museum collection at the time. As it was in a deteriorated condition, they took X-rays to assess the damage. These revealed figures including a baby in a manger, angels and what appears to be one of the three wise men or Magi. The St John the Baptist painting is believed to be about 400 years old and probably formed part of a larger altar piece. As Nicky Grimaldi, Senior Lecturer in Conservation of Fine Art at Northumbria, said: ""The first stage of most investigations of this kind is to carry out an X-ray to understand what is going on underneath the layer of paint we see on the surface. ""That was when we realised there was more to the painting than we originally thought. ""It really is quite unusual to find paintings hidden in this way and to discover a nativity scene in this detail and just before Christmas was really incredible."" More detailed investigation work will now be carried out in a bid to establish the age, background and history of both the paintings.",What is thought to be a 16th Century painting of a nativity scene has been found underneath another artwork.

"John Wright, 41, died after being attacked with a baton and knife in Stockton on 29 December 2019. Kienan Johnson hit him with the baton and Jordan Vaughan stabbed him with a knife, Teesside Crown Court has heard. Both deny murder. The court has heard Mr Wright suffered multiple injuries but a single stab wound killed him. 'Not happy' Mr Johnson, 22, told jurors he got to know Mr Vaughan, 21, a couple of weeks before the fatal attack on Mr Wright and the pair sold crack cocaine together in the Bousefield area of Stockton. He said Mr Wright bought drugs from them most days, but a day or two before the attack he gave the pair counterfeit bank notes, the court heard. Mr Johnson said he was ""not happy"" about the trick and intended to hit Mr Wright ""two or three times with the cosh"" so he ""didn't do it again"". When they came across Mr Wright on a green near Parliament Street, Mr Johnson said he hit him on the legs two or three times and on the arm and hand with ""a bit of force"" with the baton. Asked if he meant to seriously harm or kill Mr Wright, Mr Johnson replied: ""No I didn't"". 'Didn't know about knife' He said he then walked away from Mr Wright, but turned to see Mr Vaughan and Mr Wright shouting at each other, before Mr Wright reached to get something that ""looked like a brick"" and Mr Vaughan pulled Mr Wright close to him. Asked if he saw a knife or knew Mr Vaughan had one, Mr Johnson said no. He also said he did not know Mr Wright had been stabbed until later when Mr Vaughan told him. In his police interview, Mr Johnson said he deliberately stayed away from Mr Wright's head as he himself suffered a serious head injury two years previously which left him in a coma. Mr Johnson, of Windsor Road in Stockton, admits possessing a baton and Mr Vaughan, of Harlow Crescent in Thornaby, a knife. The trial continues.

"David Cameron was speaking during a visit to BBC Birmingham where he was asked how he would get the West Midlands economy growing. He said cutting corporation tax would encourage businesses to relocate to areas such as the West Midlands. He added decisions had to be taken to protect the economy's infrastructure. The West Midlands has been hit by manufacturing job losses and closures in recent years, most notably in the motor industry such as Jaguar Land Rover and the closure of MG Rover in Longbridge in 2005. Mr Cameron said: ""The deficit is what threatens our economy and by dealing with it, as we are now, we can get confidence back, we can get growth back, we can get jobs back."" ""I think the greatest danger would be doing nothing, you can see other countries in the European Union in real problems because they haven't got on top of their deficits,"" he added. Richard Burden, Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, said: ""Of course there were going to be difficult decisions to make whichever party got in ""But the fact is David Cameron's government is making the wrong decisions at the wrong time and on the wrong scale."" John Russell, chairman of the West Midlands CBI, said he agreed with the prime minister's general message. ""I think the general policy agenda is one that does support growth in the private sector,"" he added. Mr Russell, who is also the chief executive of Manganese Bronze Holdings, which makes London black cabs, said: ""I think in the West Midlands we have a very specific problem, that the regional development agency is being disbanded and we need a new structure put in place to pick up the work of that organisation. He said the main problem was the unsustainable deficit. ""We can have debates about whether we get to grips with that in six months or now, but I think the fundamental problem still remains - we need to get public sector spending under control and reduce it,"" he added.","Encouraging the private sector to grow is the way to encourage manufacturing firms to the West Midlands, the prime minister has said."
"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) rejected the application on a number of grounds. It found there were ""many variations"" in the UK and no enduring link between the product and Lincolnshire. The Lincolnshire Sausage Association (LSA) said it ""strongly contested"" Defra's findings. 'No meat' Janet Godfrey, chairman of the LSA, said: ""The judgement they gave was that 95% of Lincolnshire sausages were made outside the county. ""We've spent the last few days contacting all our butchers and we've come up with a figure of 40%, which means that only 60% are manufactured outside the county. ""That's exactly the same level that Cornish pasties were at when they put their application in,"" she said. She added: ""The LSA is bitterly disappointed that Defra has capitulated to the interest of large scale commercial producers, one of whom openly admits to putting no meat in its product."" Defra said it would give careful consideration to the appeal and look at any new evidence submitted by the LSA. The decision, as it stands, means the Lincolnshire Sausage will not be submitted to the EU Protected Food Name Scheme as a Protected Geographical Indication (PGI). A positive decision would have meant that only sausages made in the county of Lincolnshire could use the name, and they would need to be made of 70% coarse ground or minced pork, packed in natural casings and flavoured with sage. The UK now has 48 foods protected from imitations by the EU Protected Food Name Scheme, including Cornish clotted cream and Melton Mowbray pork pies.",Campaigners calling for Lincolnshire sausages to be given protected status have appealed against the government's rejection of the idea.
"The West Yorkshire venues are part of an effort to expand the vaccine rollout as quickly as supplies are available. The other two centres are Jacob's Well, in Bradford and at Navigation Walk, in Wakefield. Local GPs are also still giving vaccinations, initially to care home residents and patients aged over 80. All vaccinations are by appointment only, said the NHS Leeds Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). Dr Jason Broch, of the CCG, said: ""We know people are eager get protected and may be concerned if they are in one of the priority cohorts and have not been contacted yet. ""However, we would like to reassure them that they will be contacted over the next few weeks. Dr Broch also asked people to not call their local GP about getting a vaccination but to wait to be contacted.

"Parole Board chief executive Martin Jones said even when Helen's Law starts next year the board was obliged to free inmates who pose no risk to the public. Helen's Law is named after Helen McCourt, from Merseyside, whose killer Ian Simms was freed from jail without disclosing the location of her remains. Her mother Marie McCourt said the law could have ""gone further"". Mr Jones said prisoners would be questioned and failure to co-operate may not work in their favour. But he said it was a ""really difficult area"" and the legislation does not simply mean ""no body, no parole"". Failure to co-operate and reveal such information is ""frowned upon"" by the board and could see a prisoner having requests for parole denied in the first instance, Mr Jones said. However, he added: ""What it cannot do is act as a complete block on your release. ""Ultimately if someone is no longer a risk, we must release them."" Helen McCourt, a 22-year-old insurance clerk, vanished on her way home from work in 1988. Her body has never been found. Her killer Ian Simms was released from prison earlier this year after Mrs McCourt lost a legal bid to keep him behind bars. Mrs McCourt, 77, from St Helens, said Mr Jones's comments had ""belittled Helen's Law"". She said it was ""upsetting to hear the law may not have helped our case"" and that it was ""a very cruel time to put something like that in the papers"", causing her ""great distress."" She added: ""Simms has a violent history. How can they say a man like that - who also won't reveal information - is safe to be released? ""But they have to make sure Helen's Law makes it harder and makes it far more difficult than it has been."" Mrs McCourt said: ""I acknowledge this is not a 'no body, no parole law'â¦ I respect people's lives."" But to conceal where victims' remains are located is ""an offence against humanity"" and ""every family should have a chance to say a last goodbye"", she added. The timing of Mr Jones's comments ""just days before Christmas, is hugely insensitive to victims [and] has deeply upset Marie McCourt and many families"", said her MP, Conor McGinn. The Labour representative for St Helen's North wrote in a Tweet: ""The will of Parliament on Helen's Law is clear [and] so is the duty of the Parole Board."" Ms McCourt's family spent five years calling for legislation to help give grieving relatives closure. The Prisoners (Disclosure Of Information About Victims) Bill finally gained Royal Assent last month after a series of political and constitutional setbacks. The law sets out to toughen up existing guidelines, making it a legal requirement for the Parole Board to take into account a killer's failure to disclose the location of their victim's remains when considering them for release. It will also apply to paedophiles who refuse to identify those they abused.

"Health board officials welcomed the high turnout at sessions in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend. The figure includes 570 people who received jabs at the first clinic to be held in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. More than 940 measles cases have been confirmed with 83 people needing hospital treatment. Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABM), which covers the Swansea area, plans more evening drop-in clinics during the coming week. The number of cases in the epidemic which began last November could pass 1,000 over the weekend if current trends continue. Dr Sara Hayes, ABM Director of Public Health, said they were really pleased to see so many people attending the clinics on Saturday. ""By having your MMR you are not only protecting yourself from a horrible virus, but others such as very young babies and people who are vulnerable because they are having treatment for conditions like cancer. ""We are particularly targeting children and teenagers aged between 10 and 18 years of age who probably missed having the MMR when they were little. ""We are going in to more secondary schools offering the MMR, but if you don't want to wait or miss the session in school we are running some evening drop-in clinics next week or you can go to your GP."" Schools targeted The neighbouring Hywel Dda health board said around 570 people were vaccinated at the first drop-in clinic held in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. The board described it as ""very successful"" with the ages of the people who received the vaccination ranging from six months to 94 years old. Sixty five cases have been confirmed in Llanelli since the start of the year. All schools in the Hywel Dda region - which covers Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire - will offer vaccinations to an estimated 4,000 schoolchildren over the next four weeks. Two other health boards - Anuerin Bevan and Cardiff and Vale - held drop-in MMR clinics on previous weekends. Cases have also been identified in north Powys, and the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board serving north Wales is beginning a programme of vaccination sessions in schools. So far, only one suspected death has been linked to the measles outbreak. Further tests are to be carried out on Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, to establish the cause of death. He had measles but was known to have suffered other health problems including asthma. A post-mortem examination proved inconclusive. Meanwhile the Welsh Conservatives' health spokesman has called for a public inquiry. Darren Millar told his party conference in Swansea: ""Once this epidemic has subsided - as it eventually will - the Welsh Conservatives will press for a public inquiry into the outbreak to ensure that lessons can be learned."" In England, a Â£20m catch-up campaign already has 1.2 million vaccines ready to go amid concerns that that a generation of children have low levels of protection against measles after the MMR scare more than a decade ago. The campaign aims to vaccinate children yet to be protected with the MMR - measles, mumps and rubella - jab by September. Run through GPs, schools and community groups, it will focus on children aged 10 to 16.","More than 2,500 people have received MMR vaccinations in a fourth weekend of special clinics to tackle the Swansea measles epidemic."

"By Sally MountjoyHealth Correspondent, BBC South West Inspectors from the health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), are scrutinising services at the trust's hospitals in Truro, Hayle and Penzance. It is part of a new national inspection regime, set up in the wake of the Stafford Hospital scandal. The RCHT has been chosen as one of the first to undergo scrutiny as it has applied to become a foundation trust. Foundation status is only awarded to top-performing trusts and it gives them greater freedom from government to decide their own strategy and the way services are run. They also have greater control over their budgets. If inspectors are not satisfied with the quality of services, the bid could be refused. Target missed As well as sending in inspectors to talk to managers, staff and patients, the CQC has also asked the public to share their views of hospital care at public meetings in Truro and Penzance. The commission will also ask people what they think of their GP practices and the out-of-hours doctors service in Cornwall. These views will form part of future inspection reports. The latest figures show the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust failed to meet a key accident and emergency target. Just under 78% of patients were seen in four hours in the emergency department, in the week to 12 January, compared to an average of around 92% in major A&E units in England. The target is 95%. The emergency department is one of eight areas the CQC will be looking at in detail. The others are: medical care, surgery, intensive and critical care, maternity, children's services, end-of-life care and outpatients. A full report of the findings will be published in about six weeks. Under the new system, the trust will be rated as outstanding, good, requiring improvement, or inadequate.",The Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT) is undergoing its most rigorous ever review.
"He died last year unaware the investigation into a rape claim against him, which he denied, had been dropped. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he had made ""a very precise apology"" for not informing Lady Brittan earlier. The Brittan family said she had asked the commissioner 30 questions, which he had promised to answer in writing. Scotland Yard has acknowledged the Conservative peer's widow should have been told six months earlier that, had he been alive, he would not have been prosecuted. Investigating officers had told the alleged victim this in April 2015, a Met report into the handling of the case revealed, but Lord Brittan's legal team were not told at the same time. The force apologised for this in a letter last year. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw pointed out that, while Sir Bernard said he had ""confirmed the apology"" at Tuesday's meeting, Lord Brittan's family suggested he had gone further by offering Lady Brittan ""a full apology"". Operation Midland Speaking after the meeting, Sir Bernard said in a statement that he and Lady Brittan had had ""a private, but constructive conversation"". ""I confirmed the apology we made some months ago now, which is an apology for not telling her at an earlier stage about the fact the Lord Brittan, who by that stage had unfortunately died, was not to be prosecuted as there was no chance of a successful prosecution. ""I thought it was important to meet her and it was a very precise apology for the reasons that have previously been given."" Former home secretary Lord Brittan has also been the subject of a separate investigation as part of Operation Midland, Scotland Yard's inquiry into allegations of a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster. The Brittan family said in a statement: ""At the start of the meeting Sir Bernard offered Lady Brittan a full apology on behalf of the force, which she accepted. ""Lady Brittan went on to ask and table some 30 questions regarding the two police inquiries as they related to Lord Brittan. ""Sir Bernard promised to answer them in writing and Lady Brittan and the family await his response. ""Lady Brittan and the family have nothing further to add at least until they have received Sir Bernard's written response."" Sir Bernard said he would respond within weeks, but added: ""We'll try and do it in days."" He told BBC London that Operation Midland had not yet been concluded and historical allegations of this sort took time to investigate. ""People say: 'Why don't you complete these things quicker?' ""Well, one of the difficulties being that new witnesses come forward during the investigation. We've had to explore what they've said."" 'Premature' The Crown Prosecution Service advised the police in August 2013 that there was not enough evidence for a prosecution over the claim that Lord Brittan had raped a 19-year-old female student in 1967 - but the case was nonetheless reopened less than a year later. Police interviewed Lord Brittan, who was suffering from terminal cancer, in May 2014, but no charges were brought. Lord Brittan died in January 2015. Scotland Yard said it had delayed telling the peer when he was alive because the CPS had been asked to carry out a final review of the case. A Met spokesman also said that notifying the complainant in April had been ""premature"", because the CPS did not confirm it would not pursue the case until June 2015. Scotland Yard has faced criticism over its handling of the case but a review - carried out by Dorset Police and published earlier this month - found its investigation of the claim was ""fully justified"".

Aberystwyth University maintained its 87th place ranking from last year, while University of South Wales fell from 100th to 102nd and Wrexham-based Glyndwr University dropped 13 places to 123rd. The merged University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, which had been unranked since 2013, fought its way into the list at 125th. The top three was unchanged from last year, with Cambridge University first, Oxford second and the London School of Economics third. This year's Complete University Guide suggested Welsh universities have the highest student-staff ratios of any UK nation at just over 19 students per member of staff, compared to the UK average of 17. It is one of several guides ranking the best institutions, with the latest Times Higher Education world university rankings due out on Wednesday. Other barometers include the Research Excellence Framework, which rated almost a third of research by Welsh universities as being of ""world-leading"" quality when it was last released in December 2014.",Wales' top two universities lost ground in the latest higher education league table - with their Welsh rivals enjoying mixed results.
"The Blackburn teenager will serve at least five years for inciting terrorism and will only be released once he is no longer considered to be dangerous. He sent thousands of online messages to an alleged Australian jihadist and was planning ""a massacre"", the court heard. He is believed to be the youngest Briton guilty of a terror offence. Police said the plan hatched by the boy - who was aged 14 at the time and will remain anonymous due to his age - was ""shocking in its brutality and scope"". The boy remains a ""significant risk"", the judge at Manchester Crown Court, Mr Justice Saunders, said. Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent, said the five-year minimum term was a ""window of opportunity"" to see if the boy can be deradicalised before he is then moved into the adult prison system. But our correspondent said he may potentially never leave custody. The race to stop the teenage terrorist By BBC's Rachael Connors The teenager - now Britain's youngest convicted terrorist - comes from a ""normal"" family in Blackburn, Lancashire; he had a ""typical relationship"" with his mother who would drive him to any appointments. But the picture that emerged when police searched his bedroom was far from normal. On the windowsill they found a wooden box labelled Islamic State in the way a teenager might carve out the name of a pop idol. But it was what detectives found within encrypted messages that revealed Australia was just days away from experiencing a violent terrorist attack orchestrated by the schoolboy. Read more: How did a teenager from a ""normal"" family become Britain's youngest convicted terrorist? The court heard how the boy adopted an older persona in his messages to alleged Australian jihadist Sevdet Besim, 18, in which he instructed him to carry out an Islamic State terror group inspired attack. They had been put in touch by a well-known Islamic State recruiter, Abu Khaled al-Cambodi - also an Australian. The plot, hatched from the bedroom of the Lancashire teenager's suburban home earlier this year, was for Mr Besim to run over at least one police officer and then behead them with a knife at the remembrance parade in Melbourne, Manchester Crown Court heard. Anzac Day, held on 25 April each year, commemorates Australian and New Zealand personnel killed in conflicts - and this year marked the centenary of the World War One battle in Gallipoli. In one exchange of messages, the teenager suggested Mr Besim get his ""first taste of beheading"" by attacking ""a proper lonely person"". The pair would ""in all probability"" have succeeded had British police not accessed material on the boy's phone and alerted Australian police, the court had heard. The boy later told his psychiatrist it would be a ""massacre"". Mr Besim is awaiting trial in Australia next year. Wearing glasses and grey trousers and shirt, the boy sat impassively as his sentence was read out, before hugging his tearful parents and family members in turn, and being led away. Sentencing the teenager, judge Mr Justice Saunders said the youth would have ""welcomed the notoriety"" had the plot succeeded. He said it was ""chilling"" that someone who was only 14 years old at the time could have become ""so radicalised that he was prepared to carry out this role intending and wishing that people should die"". He had been ""immersed"" in online extremist material and ""groomed"" by adult extremists who then started using him to carry out their wishes, the judge said. Speaking outside court the boy's solicitor, Daniel King, said the family were ""shocked and devastated"" when he was arrested, as they had no idea about his intentions and were relieved that no one had been harmed. 'Jihadi celebrity' The court previously heard the teenager had been referred to the authorities by his school on several occasions for threatening behaviour, including telling one teacher he would ""cut his throat and watch him bleed to death"". He had also cited Osama Bin Laden as his hero. The youth had found an online jihadist community through his first smartphone which ""filled a void"" caused by problems he was having at school and at home as well as a degenerative eye condition. Within two weeks of setting up a Twitter account he had 24,000 followers as he constructed a fantasy image of himself and ""quickly became a celebrity"" within the jihadi Twitter community. He was referred to the government's de-radicalisation initiative Channel, but only paid ""lip service"" to attempts to reform him, Mr Justice Saunders said. He said ""no doubt lessons can and have been learnt"" about how his case might have been handled. But he stressed the blame lay entirely with ""those extremists who were prepared to use the internet to encourage extreme views in a boy of 14 and then use him to carry out terrorist acts"". Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, from the north west counter terrorism unit, said the boy had been known to police but had resisted intervention. ""That's a dangerous game to play because you can get people like us knocking on the door and investigating you, which is not the place we want to be dealing with 14-year-old people,"" he said. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of Parliament's Home Affairs Select Committee, said members would ""look closely"" at the case. ""It is concerning that he has been part of programmes for de-radicalisation which have clearly not worked,"" Mr Vaz said.",A 15-year-old British boy who plotted to behead police officers at an Anzac Day parade in Australia has been sentenced to life imprisonment.
"The service featured recordings from HMP Stocken in Rutland, HMP Low Newton in Durham and HMP Pentonville in London. Family visits to prisons have been suspended because of the pandemic. Reverend Helen Dearnley, who led the service from Stocken, said it allowed prisoners to worship with their families virtually for the first time. The service was broadcast at 09:00 BST earlier on prison television and radio as well as the Church of England's website, Facebook page and YouTube channel. It included contributions from prison staff, chaplains and prisoners. Rev Dearnley, who led the pre-recorded service, said: ""For the first time, those in prison and their families were able to worship virtually together, and all of us, separated from our communities by coronavirus, can share in this worship."" Social visits to prisons have been temporarily banned to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

"By Prof Roger ScullyCardiff University's Wales Governance Centre First, let's look at the vote across the UK. The pollsters got one thing, at least, absolutely correct. For months they have been suggesting that Scotland was the most pro-Remain part of the UK; that Northern Ireland was also pro-Remain, although somewhat less so; and that things looked much closer in both England and Wales, with Wales tending to be marginally more pro-Remain than England. And that is exactly how it turned out. These are the figures for voting (and turnout) by nation: Strikingly, the two nations that voted for Remain - Scotland and Northern Ireland - have both actually become more pro-EU since 1975. Wales and England have travelled a long way in the other direction. It is also interesting that turnout was lower in the two pro-Remain nations. This didn't change the result - even if both Scotland and Northern Ireland had had the same turnout rate as England, then Leave would still have won. It may be simply that the referendum engaged more people in England and Wales. But there may also have been some element of voter fatigue - and also activist fatigue - in Scotland, in particular, which has had a lot of campaigning and voting over the last three years. What about the vote in Wales? Understanding exactly how Wales came to vote leave will take plenty of further analysis. But we can see which areas voted for Remain and Leave. Here I've listed the 22 Welsh local authorities in order of how they voted, from the most pro-Remain to the most pro-Leave: One notable feature of the results is how many prominent Welsh politicians found themselves on the wrong side of their own local communities. Among those who supported Remain: Meanwhile, on the pro-Leave side, Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies also found himself on the opposite side of the majority of his fellow voters in the Vale of Glamorgan, as did MP David Davies in Monmouthshire. But that was not the case for all politicians. Former Welsh Secretary David Jones - whose Clwyd West seat straddles the border of Conwy and Denbighshire - would have been delighted that a majority in both counties followed his advice in supporting leave, while current Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns was (just) in the pro-Remain majority in the Vale of Glamorgan.",How did the EU referendum produce the result it did?
"She had head injuries after a Mercedes crashed into her and a girl, 11, while they were walking on Coronation Avenue, East Tilbury on 16 May. In June, Liam Jones-Bell, 25, of Markhams Close, Laindon, was jailed for three years and four months for dangerous driving. The girl is recovering from her injuries at home. Jones-Bell pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving, aggravated vehicle taking, driving other than in accordance with licence, using vehicle without insurance, failing to stop after a crash and drug and drink driving. The woman died in the early hours of Thursday and a post-mortem examination will take place to determine cause of death.

"Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the Sentinel R1 aircraft ""has proved its worth in Libya and on an ongoing basis for counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan"". Two British C17 transport aircraft have already been sent to the region. Mr Cameron has previously said Britain will not deploy ground troops in Mali. French request The Sentinel will be deployed on Friday from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire to, initially, Senegal. The RAF has a fleet of five Sentinels, but only one is being sent to west Africa. Mr Hammond said: ""As the prime minister has made clear, the UK supports France's decision to provide military support to the Malian government. ""He also said in the House that we would be looking at further French requests for additional logistical and surveillance support for this operation, over and above the two C-17s. ""Following NSC on Tuesday and discussions with the French, we have now decided to deploy Sentinel. ""We have also agreed to continue to make available a C-17 heavy lift transport aircraft which has already provided important logistical support over recent days."" Training forces Earlier this week, Mr Cameron spoke of a global ""generational struggle"" against al Qaida-inspired Islamist terrorism in North Africa. He also said the UK should ""thicken"" links with region following this month's hostage crisis in Algeria at a gas facility, in which 69 people are known to have died. Three Britons are known to have died in the attacks and a further three are believed to be dead, along with a British resident from Colombia. Mr Cameron also said Britain would provide troops to an EU mission to train the Malian military, who are fighting Islamist militants who have taken over the north of the country. The mission, due to deploy in February or March, is expected to include about 250 trainers and 250 force protection troops. The prime minister said the British contribution would number ""in the tens, not the hundreds"". The Sentinel spy plane is a modified business jet which uses radar to create accurate real-time images of what is happening on the ground, and was used in Libya during the uprising against Colonel Gaddafi. They continue to be used in Afghanistan. The RAF's fleet of Sentinels, their airborne stand-off radar (ASTOR) and a through-life support contract will cost the UK taxpayer Â£1bn over 10 years.

"The Labour-run Oxford City Council approved the proposals for the Westgate on Wednesday evening, which include a John Lewis store and some housing. Council deputy leader Ed Turner called it ""fantastic news for Oxford"" and said 2,500 new jobs would be created. But Sushila Dhall from the Green Party said plans would lead to major traffic congestion and the land should be used on alternative projects. She added: ""I think the current Westgate Centre could do with being revamped but at the back of it where St Ebbe's was demolished we could make the best use of the land by having affordable housing, small business units, a community centre, public space, and have it car-free."" 'Prime retail space' Nigel Wild, president of Oxfordshire's chamber of commerce, welcomed the improvements. He said: ""We need that kind of income, we need that kind of attraction. ""Oxford desperately needs some prime retail space and prime retail outlets. ""Shopping in Oxford has been traditionally poor and we need that kind of development in order to attract people to make it a destination city."" Building work will include an underground car park and could begin in 2014. Mr Turner said he was hopeful the shops and car park would open ""in the next five or six years"". The terms of the agreement are to be finalised in March.",Plans for a new Â£330m Oxford shopping centre have been approved.

"Concrete blocks have been installed along Herbert Street in Pontardawe to allow for social distancing. Neath Port Talbot council leader Rob Jones said people kept moving the plastic barriers previously used. Greengrocer Kelly Frost criticised the council's actions as ""a war against disabled people and local businesses"". She claimed the concrete blocks were ""unfair"" and would deter shoppers from visiting the town, saying her shop had already ""taken a hit"" in lower takings since the plastic barriers were installed in June. A local resident who gave her name as Leanne told the Local Democracy Reporting Service the new barriers would limit the number of elderly and disabled shoppers visiting the town. She said an elderly relative in his 70s fell while walking along Herbert Street last Wednesday, the day after the concrete bollards were installed in the disabled bays, forcing him to park further down the street. ""He has literally been the first casualty, within the first week, of those ridiculously, ill thought-out bollards,"" she said. Mr Jones said officials on a site visit to inspect the plastic barriers had ""witnessed one driver pulling up and attempting to kick the barriers out of place rather than look for an available parking space elsewhere"". ""We spoke to traders on the side of the road who were operational at the time and were experiencing queues, and they supported the continued use of barriers to manage safe queues,"" he said. ""They also indicated their frustration at the constant removal of the barriers by third parties and confirmed that they on occasion have had to reinstate them. ""There was a reliance on council staff having to go back to put them back in place. This was not sustainable on a daily basis given the restricted resources available.""","Residents and traders are outraged by ""ill thought-out"" barriers that have blocked off disabled parking bays in a busy shopping street."

His parents had been embroiled in a custody battle and Miss Yarrow-Sanders disappeared a few weeks before she was due to give evidence at a hearing. Patrick Sheridan begged his estranged partner to let Olly have a ""normal childhood"", not a life ""on the run"". But in a letter shared on social media by her sister, Miss Yarrow-Sanders said she had been warned by her solicitor ""there is a strong possibility that Olly will be appointed a guardian by the court"". She said she felt fleeing was ""the only thing I could do for Olly to have any semblance of a childhood with his mum"". ""I will never let any harm come to Olly,"" she added. Last month, High Court judge Mr Justice Williams waived an anonymity ruling in an effort to aid the search for the pair.

Meanwhile, airlines have cut thousands of flights including to and from Italy after the country was put on lockdown. And GPs are warning routine appointments at surgeries may have to stop as the number of coronavirus cases rises. The British Medical Association said routine monitoring of long-term health conditions might have to stop to enable GPs to ""focus on the sickest patients"". Earlier, England's deputy chief medical officer defended the decision to delay closing schools and introducing other stringent measures, saying experts were assessing new cases on an hourly basis to achieve a ""balanced response"". Dr Jenny Harries said she expected significant increases in the number of cases in the UK beginning in about 10 to 14 days time, at which point people with flu-like symptoms would be advised to self-isolate. The vast majority of those diagnosed with coronavirus in Britain were ""pretty well"" but might ""feel a bit rough for a few days"", she added. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said ""wherever clinically and practically possible"" people should access GP appointments ""through phones and digital means"", rather than going to surgeries in person. The figures as of 9:00 GMT on Tuesday included 324 cases in England, 27 in Scotland, 16 in Northern Ireland and six in Wales. The additional nine cases confirmed in Wales on Tuesday evening bring its total to 15. There are 91 in London, with the next highest infected area being south-east, with 51 cases.

"The royal couple held Prince George, who cried as they waved from the steps of a plane in Canberra before beginning their journey back to the UK. On the final day of the trip they joined a dawn service to honour Australia's war dead to mark Anzac Day. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine had been ""bowled over"" by their welcome on the tour. The tour, which has included Prince George's first royal engagements, has also taken in Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide after they first visited New Zealand. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott was among the dignitaries at Canberra airport as the family boarded the Royal Australian Air Force plane taking them to their flight home. A Kensington Palace spokesman said: ""The tour of New Zealand and Australia has been an incredible experience for both the Duke and Duchess and the couple really have enjoyed it immensely. ""We always said this would be an opportunity for the duke to introduce both countries to the duchess and Prince George and the couple have been bowled over by the extraordinarily warm welcome shown to them as a family by people everywhere they went."" Earlier, the royal couple joined military personnel, veterans and the public in Canberra to mark Anzac Day. The Australian War Memorial held a service at dawn, in keeping with tradition, as a reminder of the dawn landing of troops on Gallipoli in 1915. Later in the morning the couple, appearing without their son Prince George, laid a wreath at the memorial. The duke and duchess, who have also visited New Zealand during their tour, joined figures including Mr Abbott and Governor General Sir Peter Cosgrove in paying their respects. The name Anzac Day comes from the acronym used to describe the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. More than 500,000 Allied soldiers were involved in the Gallipoli campaign, an attempt to open the Dardanelles Strait in modern-day Turkey to Allied navies during World War One. Tens of thousands of Allied troops, including more than 8,000 Australians, died in the campaign, which failed to achieve its military objectives.",The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's three-week tour of Australia and New Zealand has drawn to a close.
"The Sunday Telegraph says the measures could affect the sentencing of murderers of pre-school age children. The government also wants violent and sexual offenders to serve at least two thirds of their terms, the paper said. The prime minister plans to use next month's Queen's Speech to introduce the changes, according to the Telegraph. These could be contained in a Sentencing Bill or a statutory instrument, a form of secondary legislation which can be brought in without Parliament having to pass a new Act. The government would not give any detail of the planned law changes. But a Ministry of Justice spokesperson did say Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered an urgent review into sentencing policy last month and would bring forward proposals ""shortly"". Currently, judges sentencing murderers of children in cases which involve abduction or a sexual or sadistic motivation can consider a whole-life order - or ""life means life"" order, which means the offender will never be released from prison. Rosemary West, who was convicted in 1995 of murdering 10 young women and girls after first subjecting them to horrific sexual violence, is in prison on a whole life order. It is possible the government might try to broaden part of Schedule 21 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 which provides a ""starting point"" for judges considering whole-life orders for murderers in exceptionally grave cases. Where there is no evidence of abduction or a sexual or sadistic motivation in a child murder case, the offender must still be given a life sentence. A life sentence differs from a whole-life order in that a judge can specify the minimum term they must spend in prison before becoming eligible to apply for parole. Once released, an offender remains on licence for the rest of their life and can be recalled to prison at any time. Other measures from Mr Johnson, outlined in the Telegraph, include: Analysis: Message appeals to voters' crime concerns By Peter Saull, BBC political reporter The exact nature of the changes to sentencing are not yet clear, but this is a further attempt from the Boris Johnson government to appeal to voters' concerns over crime. Downing Street has a three-pronged strategy - deliver Brexit, defend the NHS and get tough on crime. The plans for stronger sentencing guidelines follow announcements on extra police officers and an extension of stop and search powers. It's a message that is likely to appeal to traditional Conservative voters but also Labour voters worried about rising crime levels. Boris Johnson is yet to secure the general election he craves, but the campaign has been under way for some time.",The government is planning changes to the law aimed at bringing in longer sentences for some of England and Wales' worst criminal offenders.
"Customer Gwion Schiavone had taken his complaint against Admiral Insurance to the Welsh language commissioner. Meri Huws said she needed evidence before investigating but First Minister Carwyn Jones said he would look into the complaint. Admiral employs 5,000 people in Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Mr Schiavone told BBC Wales' Welsh language news programme Newyddion 9 that the insurance company told him every conversation had to be conducted in English to satisfy regulators. The company has since said this was not its policy and apologised for the error. 'Preferred language' In a statement, the company said: ""I'm sorry Mr Schiavone was told he could not conduct his business with Admiral in Welsh. ""It is not our policy that all calls must be conducted in English and Mr Schiavone should not have been told this was the case."" First Minister Carwyn Jones said he was ""happy"" to look into the matter. ""It doesn't make business sense for a company to be seen as one which fails to provide services in Welsh, especially a big company,"" said Mr Jones. ""I would think that Admiral would want to ensure that services in Welsh are available."" In a letter to Mr Schiavone, Admiral said there was no guarantee a Welsh speaker would be available in future to answer customer calls. The Welsh language commissioner said she was unable to hold an investigation due to a lack of evidence. A spokesperson for Meri Huws said: ""The Welsh language commissioner encourages all private sector companies in Wales to engage with their customers through their preferred language.

"He also accused companies of shifting ""superficially"" but only ""for the benefit of their own PR"". Mr Collins is to lead a sub-committee of MPs to probe ""threats posed by disinformation to democracies"". Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants his company to become ""privacy-focused"". An 18-month long inquiry into fake news by the culture committee found that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg failed to show ""leadership and personal responsibility"" over fake news. The inquiry began in September 2017 and culminated in a final report released in February. The newly established sub-committee will build on the inquiry - which looked into the effects of social media on society; Facebook's handling of users' data; and how the official Brexit campaigns broke electoral law during the 2016 EU referendum. Mr Collins said: ""As we stated at the time, our report on disinformation and fake news was not the final word on the matter. ""We believe that there's a strong public interest in establishing the sub-committee to continue probing ongoing threats posed by disinformation to democracies, a threat that hasn't disappeared with the end of our inquiry. ""We look forward to continuing the highly important work that we have begun. ""Since beginning our investigations, tech companies have only shifted superficially in their approach to privacy, and only for the benefit of their own PR. ""It's unacceptable and we must keep up the pressure for them to shift their approach to ensure people and their rights are protected."" What did the fake news inquiry call for? Facebook has said it is making progress tackling fake news - pointing to external research that suggested the amount of fake news shared on its platform was decreasing.

"Members rejected the idea of moving towards just two centres from the current eight - backing the principle of retaining three. Johnstone in Renfrewshire will be retained, along with two others. The plan could mean the closure of control rooms in Inverness, Aberdeen, Thornton in Fife, Maddiston near Falkirk, and Dumfries. The Scottish government said before the meeting that the details of the plan were a ""matter for the board"". The strategy put to the board also included a single national training centre at Cambuslang, and the identification of a national headquarters building ""located in the area bounded by Perth, Glasgow and Edinburgh"". The fire service would dispose of the Scottish Fire Service College at Gullane in East Lothian, and property at Maddiston and Thornton. Property would also be released at Cowcaddens in Glasgow and North Anderson Drive in Aberdeen, although fire stations would be retained at both sites. Also surplus to requirements would be Lauriston Place in Edinburgh, although ""steps will be taken to ensure continued public access to heritage assets in Edinburgh"". Re-investment The paper presented to the fire board estimated that not pursuing a programme of property rationalisation and investment would involve continuing costs of Â£4.7m per year, equivalent to 162 firefighter posts. It said that ""dialogue will be maintained at all levels with the Scottish government"" to ensure that permission is granted for money raised by disposal of surplus properties to be re-invested. The paper stated: ""It is recognised that property rationalisation will have a significant impact on employees and throughout the process detailed analysis has been undertaken to understand the nature and extent of this."" In advance of the board meeting, the Scottish government confirmed it had been informed of the strategy. A spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of proposals to be discussed by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Board. However the detail of these is an operational matter for the board. ""The board is committed to the Scottish government's policy of no compulsory redundancies."" Fire Brigades Union's Scottish chairman Alan Paterson said: ""We will start to consult with our members on the detail once we have time to digest it and then both sides can get back into some meaningful discussions and negotiations with service managers. ""On any proposals, when it comes to the details, it's very difficult to measure of what degree the risk is."" Implementation plan Following the board meeting, Chief Officer Alasdair Hay said: ""This is not something that will be achieved overnight. ""It will take a number of years and requires a detailed implementation plan. ""What I can say is that we are committed to ensuring community safety and firefighter safety and that any changes we make will not compromise those two critical tenets of our organisation."" Fire board chairman Pat Watters added: ""I recognise that the plans discussed today will affect a number of our staff and naturally everyone is concerned when there is change. ""It is important to stress these changes will take a number of years and we will be working closely with staff and representative bodies as we develop implementation plans."" Scottish Labour's justice spokesman Graeme Pearson said: ""Of course it's important that the merger of the fire boards leads to relevant efficiency savings but there also has to be consideration of the wider economic impact. ""I'm concerned that these decisions have been rushed through and there hasn't been any thought on what happens in the local communities where the call centres were. ""I would also like reassurance that the closure of these offices doesn't lead to any dip in service."" Scottish Liberal Democrat justice spokeswoman Alison McInnes has criticised the proposals. She said: ""Increasing the number of planned centres from two to three is simply not good enough. This will result in a significant loss of local knowledge, which we know is crucial to our emergency services. ""You can't put a price on life and it is a false and crass choice to say we can either have more control centres or more firefighters.""",The Scottish Fire and Rescue Board has voted to consult on plans to reduce the number of fire control rooms.
"The nine most serious cases have seen flu patients end up in intensive care beds. More than 2,400 people have also seen their GP with the symptoms so far this winter. Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine programme at Public Health Wales, said: ""It's not too late to get vaccinated."" It comes as visits to GPs, hospital and intensive care admissions have all increased across Wales in the past few weeks. Officials said flu will inevitably add to the burden on accident and emergency departments across many parts of Wales already dealing with existing winter pressures. All age groups have been affected, although young children, the elderly and adults with chronic conditions are particularly vulnerable. Dr Roberts added: ""Recent figures suggest that flu is now circulating across Wales. Although those in risk groups should have been vaccinated by now, it's not too late to get vaccinated."" The vaccine protects against the most common H1N1 virus. Influenza B viruses are also being detected, which usually affect younger people and children. ""From recent experience, we would expect that the flu virus will be circulating in Wales for six to eight weeks or even longer so it is important to ensure that remaining eligible people are vaccinated as quickly as possible,"" said Dr Roberts.","Cases of flu are rising in Wales with 51 patients treated in hospital since October, public health officials have said."
"Tom Sinclair, who ran the weekly Pembrokeshire Herald, said 24 members of staff had been made redundant. The group included the Carmarthenshire Herald and Llanelli Herald, and previously the loss-making Ceredigion Herald which had already closed. In March, Mr Sinclair admitted he ""made mistakes"" after defying court orders to repay Â£70,000 to creditors. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said the way journalists, photographers and local communities were treated was ""outrageous"". In 2017, his professional reputation was damaged when he was convicted of publishing information likely to identify the victim of a sex offence. After the latest edition of the papers went to print on Thursday, Mr Sinclair said a meeting was held where it was confirmed that further investor funding would not happen. ""We are absolutely devastated that after nearly seven years and hundreds of editions of the paper we can no longer continue,"" he said. ""I would like to think that over those years, some of the stories we have written have made a difference to Pembrokeshire and beyond."" John Hammond, director of Herald News UK Ltd, added: ""We have to face the fact that there is no way that we can now continue in a solvent position. ""Whilst there has been a slow decline in readership of local newspapers, our costs for wages, printing and transport have substantially increased."" NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: ""In the past the NUJ has been strongly critical over how the Herald has treated its journalists, owing money to both freelances and ex-employees, with individuals forced to go through the courts and court judgments left unpaid. ""At the time editor Tom Sinclair, blaming poor business decisions, said he had secured new investment that would allow him to repay everybody - including six former employees - within six months. Unfortunately, that promise did not materialise and those individuals owed money are still waiting."" Former employee Alan Evans, who is now editor of Llanelli Online, has claimed he is still owed Â£7,000 and previously pursued Mr Sinclair through the courts to stop him from closing his company and avoiding his debts. ""I saw it coming a long time ago. I left after being owed a lot of money,"" he said. ""It became saturated with call centre staff and the main focus was generating income. Journalism was by the by. It was inevitable. Newsprint is going to continue to struggle. It's tough times. ""The losers are community organisations and schools.""",A controversial newspaper editor has confirmed the three papers in the group have ceased trading after seven years.
"The 19-year-old, who cannot be named, is charged with causing public mischief for allegedly making a false claim of being attacked in a hotel in July. Twelve Israeli tourists were arrested but later freed after the woman retracted her allegation. If found guilty, she could face jail. Her defence lawyers said investigators had exerted pressure and threatened her and her friends with arrest. They insisted the retraction she made should not be admissible in her trial. Cypriot authorities strongly deny that the retraction was coerced, saying the woman volunteered the statement in writing. The woman's legal team read a statement from an Israeli witness about the night she claims she was raped. ""They said they were going to stay in our flat because the English girl was coming there later,"" it said. ""They were talking about it and laughing, saying they were going to do orgies with her. ""They were saying this in a very bad and aggressive way,"" the statement said, adding they ""looked like they were ready - all of them"" to have sex with her that night. The woman, dressed in a white sweater with her hair tied up, followed proceedings with the help of an interpreter. She broke down at the end of the hearing as the judge raised his voice. Missed out on university Five Israelis were freed on 25 July after no evidence was found linking them to the case. The other seven were released three days later after police said the woman retracted the rape allegations. The woman spent four-and-a-half weeks in prison before she was granted bail at the end of August. She has had to surrender her travel documents to the police and remains on the island, supported by her family. Before the court hearing, Michael Polak, of Justice Abroad, which is assisting in the woman's legal defence, said: ""She obviously just wants to go home."" He said she had missed out on a place at university and was seeing a psychologist for post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by the incident. The case has been adjourned until 15 October.","A group of Israeli men were heard discussing a young British woman in an ""aggressive way"" on the night she said they gang-raped her in the tourist town of Ayia Napa, a Cypriot court hears."
"The 'Beeline' routes are part of cycling guru Chris Boardman's Â£1.5bn masterplan to get more people on their bikes. If approved the first Beelines would cost about Â£28m with work set to begin by the end of the year. The plans would also see 60 new and upgraded crossings and junctions across Greater Manchester. The new routes would include six miles (9.6km) of segregated Dutch-style cycle lanes that are separated from motor traffic. 'Reclaiming streets' The plans will be considered by Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) next week. Mr Boardman said: ""The public response to the launch has been simply overwhelming. ""We are reclaiming streets so that they work for people first - just like we've seen many great cities around the world do - and we are ready to reap all of the benefits that come with it."" Mr Boardman said more routes are hoped to be published in the coming weeks. Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: ""It is hugely exciting to see the first of many schemes coming through and the impact will be truly transformational."" About Â£25m of funding is coming from the Mayor's Cycling and Walking Challenge Fund with a further Â£4m from Greater Manchester's district councils and the Department for Transport's Cycle City Ambition Grant.",A proposed network of 15 new cycling and walking routes for Greater Manchester has been unveiled.
"Devon and Cornwall Police said the officer was sent to Trevenson Road in Newquay, Cornwall, over reports a man was ""behaving aggressively"". The officer suffered the ""severe but non life-threatening"" burns at the scene and has been taken to Treliske Hospital by air ambulance. A man, 30, from Newquay is in custody. Ch Supt Ian Drummond-Smith said officers were called after a man who was living in a field without permission refused to leave when asked by bailiffs. He described it as a ""very serious incident"", adding ""My thoughts are with our officer."" 'Good spirits' He said colleagues attended the scene ""within minutes"", and were assisted by members of the public and the bailiffs ""in bringing this to a safe resolution"". The unnamed 51-year-old officer - a former Army soldier - suffered some significant burns to his body, Mr Drummond-Smith said. ""To the best of my knowledge his face was not burnt,"" he said. ""He is conscious, he is sat up in his hospital bed and he's talking to us on the telephone - he is in good spirits,"" he added. The officer's colleagues posted a Twitter message on his behalf thanking ""all those who have sent kind messages of support"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said the incident was ""truly appalling and unacceptable"". ""My thoughts are with the brave officer and his loved ones at this time,"" she said.

"Nottingham Crown Court heard Katie Crowder had deliberately scalded 19-month-old Gracie on 6 March at home and delayed getting help as she died. Sally Howes QC said Gracie had suffered burns that covered 65% of her body and had been left for at least an hour. The girl's severe and extensive injuries could not have been caused accidentally, the prosecutor added. A post-mortem examination gave Gracie's cause of death as ""scalds and thermal burns from exposure to hot liquid"". Crowder, 26, of Wharmby Avenue, Mansfield, had denied murder but wept in the dock as she was convicted on Tuesday following a three-week trial. She will be sentenced on 16 December. The jury had heard Crowder appeared at her parents' house nearby shortly before 06:30 GMT holding Gracie in her arms, shouting ""she's dead"". Paul and Karen Crowder said their daughter sounded ""panicked"" as she knocked on their door and they called an ambulance. However Ms Howes said Gracie's death was not instant and Crowder had delayed getting help to ""cover her tracks"". ""She knew what she had done, cleaning up, cleaning away, thinking of what she could possibly say as an explanation,"" she told the court. She said the toddler's injuries were not immediately life-threatening and had she received help straight away, she could have survived. Experts had given evidence to say they believed it would have taken Gracie ""in the region of an hour"" to die from her injuries, and she would have been ""screaming"". Ms Howes also told jurors the amount of cocaine found in the defendant's blood four hours later was consistent with Crowder taking the class A drug in the hour before Gracie's death. 'Most difficult' Crowder told the trial she had not heard anything and found Gracie lying on the bathroom floor next to a mop bucket. She claimed she filled the bucket with hot water to clean up dog urine but then abandoned it in the bathroom to get changed and empty clothes from the washing machine. Following the verdict, Det Ch Insp Rob Routledge said going to the post-mortem examination was ""one of the most difficult things I've done"". ""Nobody likes to think a parent can do that to their own child,"" he said. He said the case was ""one of the most unusual"" he had worked on due to a lack of witnesses and CCTV. ""There is only one person who knows exactly what happened inside that house [Crowder], and it was the prosecution's case she was not telling the truth,"" he added. ""We knew there were inconsistencies in the story, but we had to prove that what Crowder said had happened couldn't possibly have happened. ""Thankfully these cases are rare, but you never get hardened to a job like this. ""They aren't injuries you will forget. That gave everyone determination to find out the truth.

"The hole opened up in August above an old lead mine near Cowshill, 260ft (80m) from the home of John Hensby. Mr Hensby said the hole was slowly growing a few metres a week and that sheep were getting too close. Durham County Council has closed off a nearby footpath and is due to inspect the site later this month. It is not responsible for the land which is owned by Mr Hensby. The retired salesman lives in a stone two-storey house built in the 1870s and owns 10 acres of former mining land. He said there was no point putting a fence around the hole and it kept growing. He said: ""As you can see, there is no fencing around it, as there is basically no point in fencing it when it is still falling in. ""We have surrounded the hole with some metal stakes linked by danger tape, but as you can see the neighbouring sheep have had their merry way with them - time and time again. ""The council rights of way officer has been most helpful and towards the end of the month he and we and a number of other people will be gathering for a site inspection and discussion of the way forward."" Mr Hensby previously said he was worried about sheep falling in but believes his home should be safe. His partner Sam Hillyard, 39, first spotted the sinkhole in August. Mr Hensby, who has lived in the former mine manager's house for six years, said: ""Experts say one heavy rainfall could make it a lot worse.""","Sheep keep pulling down a safety cordon surrounding a 200ft (60m) sinkhole which is getting bigger, a landowner has warned."
"Letters were sent out to patients at Hamilton Medical Group, on Queen's Road, to offer the jag on Saturday 17 January. However it should have been Sunday 17 January. Aberdeen City Health and Social Care Partnership (ACHSCP) said it was an administrative error made centrally, and not at the practice.

"Two others who were in the vehicles - boys aged 14 and 16 - have been treated for minor injuries. They were travelling in an orange Vauxhall Corsa which crashed on the A90 near St Madoes on Saturday afternoon. It was being pursued by police officers after failing to stop for them on Edinburgh Road in Perth at about 13:55. Police Scotland said on Saturday that none of the force's vehicles were involved in the crash. All four occupants of the Corsa were taken to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee for treatment. Officers have appealed for dashcam footage to help with their inquiries into the incident. Sgt Michelle Burns said: ""Our inquiries into this incident are ongoing and we would urge anyone who may have seen the Vauxhall Corsa or the police vehicles in Perth, on the A912 through Bridge of Earn or on the A90 to come forward.

"He was born in Inverness and grew up in a remote crofter's cottage in the Highlands. He was educated at Lochaber High School - where at 15 he joined the Labour Party - and at Glasgow University. A young Mr Kennedy had political ambitions, joining the Dialectic Society, a debating society; becoming president of the union in 1980; and joining the Social Democratic Party (SDP). He became the youngest MP of the time, at the age of 23, when he won the Ross, Cromarty and Skye seat in 1983. He was at the forefront of the calls for a merger with the Liberal Party and negotiated much of the successful deal. Later, Mr Kennedy supported Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown's attempts to form an alliance with the Labour Party, based around a shared commitment to electoral reform and Europe. But as soon as he became leader, Mr Kennedy set about uncoupling from Labour. He was elected leader of the party in 1999, aged just 39. He said he wanted to make the Liberal Democrats a party of government, by building its strength on local councils and in the devolved administrations of Scotland and Wales. Mr Kennedy was a witty figure, more than capable of holding his own on television panel games such as Have I Got News for You. He was even nicknamed ""Chatshow Charlie"". He married public relations executive Sarah Gurling in 2002, with this seen by many in the party as a sign he was ""settling down"". His son Donald was born during the 2005 general election campaign. He took a few days off then returned to the campaign trail with ""a song in my heart and a spring in my step"". In 2005, Mr Kennedy took the deliberate decision to campaign against the war in Iraq when both Tony Blair and Conservative leader Michael Howard were saying it was right to go to war. After the 2005 election, Mr Kennedy's leadership came under increased criticism from those who felt the party could have surged forward. Mr Kennedy announced his resignation as party leader in January 2006, two days after admitting he had a drink problem. In his resignation speech he said he did not expect to remain on the Liberal Democrat frontbench team and pledged his loyalty to a new leader ""as a backbencher"". During the 2015 general election campaign in May, Mr Kennedy was on the campaign trail, here with Jo Swinson, the candidate for East Dunbartonshire. However, Mr Kennedy lost his Ross, Skye and Lochaber seat - which he had held for 32 years - to the SNP. He described the defeat as ""the night of long skean dhus"".",Former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy has died at his home in Scotland aged 55 .
"Charles Hendry backed the Â£1.3bn project in his government-commissioned review published in January 2017. The UK Government is yet to give the go-ahead, but the Welsh Government has said it will offer ""substantial investment"". But Mr Hendry argued the delay implied the project would still happen. ""The fact the government hasn't said no is a cause for optimism,"" he said. ""I think the easiest thing for a government would have been to say quite early on in the process of reviewing my conclusions, to say we've looked at it alongside our other priorities, and this really isn't the time to do it - they haven't done that,"" he added. ""We've had distractions such as a general election, ministerial changes. So inevitably, it has taken the government some time to reach its conclusions, but I still think the case is compelling."" Critics of the project argue it is too expensive, and will tie bill-payers into topping it up for almost a century, even though new technologies are likely to have emerged by then. The developers want the government to guarantee the price paid for electricity from the lagoon over a 90 year period - a much longer contract than usual. It would start at Â£123 per megawatt hour - higher than the Â£92.50 offered to the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant in Somerset - but reducing over time. It averages out at Â£89.90 per megawatt hour over the length of the contract - but given that the lagoon is predicted to keep generating for up to 120 years it would be producing free power for the grid for the last 30 years. Critics say other more established renewable schemes like wind and solar are already much cheaper and so the priority should be given to them. Even if the finances are sorted, developers still need a marine licence to build it. But anglers in the area are worried about the impact the lagoon's 16 large turbines could have on fish and other wildlife. Much of the delays over the scheme's approval have been over whether it will provide ""value for money"". But Mr Hendry said the Â£1.3bn cost would equate to ""less than 50p a year"" per household and it would ""be some of the cheapest power"" the UK would ever have, once the original capital investment has been paid off. However, that is expected to take half of the lagoon's lifetime, which could be more than 120 years. Mr Hendry was also buoyed by First Minister Carwyn Jones' promise to invest in the project, which he said would generate more money for Wales as the Welsh Government would take partial ownership of the lagoon. He also said it would make a ""significant difference"" to the chances of the project going ahead. ""I still think the case is compelling. And I think this is something that future generations will say 'thank you for doing it, Wales has led the world'."" Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea City Council said: ""We've always said in this region we can't rely on others to do stuff. ""If the UK government won't help us with this, if they can't see the value of fixing energy prices and renewable forms of energy long term then they need to get out of the way and let us get on with delivering it and we will look at other ways to do that.""","The Swansea tidal lagoon will still happen despite delays, the man who conducted an independent review into tidal energy has predicted."

The scheme will expand through Wandsworth, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lambeth, and Kensington and Chelsea. London mayor Boris Johnson said: ""We are now planning to swathe a huge chunk of the west of our city with our beautiful blue bikes."" Westfield London Shopping Centre, in White City, west London, will provide funding that will allow a preview of the western expansion by extending the scheme to the centre by spring 2012. 'Increasingly popular' Plans include 12 new docking stations which will connect the existing cycle hire zone to Westfield, with six docking stations on the grounds of the shopping centre. Each day, about 22,000 people use more than 5,000 hire bikes in the capital. The scheme, which began in July last year, currently operates in Camden, City of London, Hackney, Islington, parts of Lambeth, parts of Kensington and Chelsea, Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Westminster and several of the Royal Parks.

"Dame Cheryl Gillan told parliament information was not disclosed at a pre-trial hearing in 2003 regarding paedophile Roland Peter Wright. It led to a judge ordering a stay which meant the case was not heard in open court. The issue came to light in 2008 but no action was taken, Dame Gillan said. The Crown Prosecution Service said it applied to lift the stay in 2012. The MP for Chesham and Amersham was holding an adjournment debate on the issue of non-disclosures in the courts system. She said the matter was brought to her attention by one of her constituents who said he was abused by Wright. Wright was the headmaster of Caldicott Preparatory School in Buckinghamshire from 1968 to 1993. In 2014 he was jailed for eight years for sexually abusing five pupils between 1959 and 1970. Dame Cheryl said there were two indictments brought in the case against Wright, the first in 2003 and the second in 2012, but only the second made it to trial. ""The counts that related to the extensive abuse suffered at Caldicott School by my constituent, as well as by a further four former pupils, were contained in the first indictment that was stayed,"" she said. ""That meant that the history of abuse suffered by my constituent... and the other former pupils was never heard in open court."" 'Appalling discovery' The MP explained the defence made an application to Aylesbury Crown Court for the stay, but failed to disclose relevant information relating to it. She said the defence did not tell the court about their correspondence with the school regarding pupil records. She said her constituent was ""deeply unhappy about the negative outcome"" and the ""appalling discovery"" that the court was ""gravely misled"". Ms Gillan told Parliament: ""To my constituent's complete and abiding astonishment the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) did absolutely nothing."" A spokeswoman for the CPS said: ""We take allegations of historic sexual abuse very seriously and clearly it is concerning that it took so long for Roland Wright to be convicted. ""The allegations which have been raised are of non-disclosure by the defence, not the prosecution. ""We applied to the judge to lift the stay in 2012 and, whilst a trial on the victims' allegations was not possible, they were able to give evidence in other proceedings against Roland Wright."" The Solicitor General Lucy Frazer QC told Ms Gillan she acknowledges the ""hurt and anger"" felt by her constituent, but there were ""no findings of any misconduct by the bar standards board in relation to the case"".","A court was ""gravely misled"" when it prevented a child sexual abuse case from being heard, an MP has said."

"Diageo staff allegedly told BII Scotland to change one of the winners at their annual event, or risk losing Diageo sponsorship in future years. The winner of the 'Bar Operator of the Year' award - Aberdeenshire-based BrewDog - was subsequently changed. The annual BII Scotland awards took place in Glasgow on 6 May. Diageo's brands include Guinness, Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky. The award-winners were initially decided by an independent panel. Brewdog, in an account of the events published on its website, claimed it was told by one of the judges at the awards ceremony: ""This simply cannot be, the independent judging panel voted for BrewDog as clear winners of the award."" They also said the new ""winner"" refused to accept the trophy as it already had ""BrewDog"" engraved on it. A statement from Diageo said: ""There was a serious misjudgement by Diageo staff at the awards dinner on Sunday evening in relation to the Bar Operator of the Year Award, which does not reflect in anyway Diageo's corporate values and behaviour. ""We would like to apologise unreservedly to BrewDog and to the British Institute of Innkeeping for this error of judgement and we will be contacting both organisations imminently to express our regret for this unfortunate incident.""","Drinks giant Diageo has apologised after admitting a ""serious misjudgement"" over the British Institute of Innkeeping (BII) awards."
"Volunteers in Y Fron, Gwynedd, hope to turn the 170-year-old Ysgol Bronyfoel into an 18-bed bunkhouse, shop, cafe and community rooms. A Grade II-listed shed at Meliden, Denbighshire, will become a cafe and heritage centre with a bike hire facility, allotments and orchard. Land at Porthcawl, Bridgend county, will house a new maritime centre. The funding is part of the Big Lottery Fund project to help community groups take on local facilities and put them to better use. Work on the school at Y Fron in the Nantlle Valley will start in 2017 and the project is expected to open in early 2018. Jim Embrey, chairman of Canolfan Y Fron, the group behind the scheme, said the Â£947,000 grant would ""genuinely transform"" the area. The renovation of Ysgol Bronyfoel, which closed in 2015, will also include a new treatment room for health, therapy and beauty services and changing rooms for the adjacent playing field. The Â£1.1m renovation work on the shed will also begin next year. Located on the Prestatyn to Dyserth cycle way, the project will also feature two workshop units and a small shop. Grwp Cynefin community initiatives manager, Mair Edwards, said: ""The shed is going to provide valuable employment, volunteering and learning opportunities, and preserve the heritage of Meliden."" Porthcawl Harbourside CIC will use Â£1.1m to build a maritime centre and community hub on land transferred from the county council. It is located in the Porthcawl harbour quarter and will provide an all-weather community and visitor attraction with an emphasis on coastal science, maritime history, maritime-related sport and leisure, and community learning and employment.","An empty school, a former railway goods shed and harbourside land will be transformed with Â£3m of lottery grants."
"Sandy Wilkie, 57, said the experience led to depression and being signed off work for four months. He said he returned to work to be told his role no longer existed. He now expects to receive a settlement from NHS Highland, which is part of the partnership and set up a ""healing process"" to deal with bullying claims. Mr Wilkie told The Herald newspaper that the organisation was an ""absolute nest of vipers"". Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership said the health and wellbeing of its staff was a priority. The partnership involves Argyll and Bute Council and NHS Highland. Allegations of bullying raised in 2018 at NHS Highland were the subject of a review led by John Sturrock QC, with the focus on examining issues raised by staff working in the Highlands. The results of the review, published last year, suggested hundreds of health workers had potentially experienced inappropriate behaviour at the health board. In May this year, NHS Highland offered staff who experienced bullying an ""independent healing process"" for handling their concerns. Also this year, Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership surveyed staff about bullying. Of the 1,500 staff surveyed, 508 responded, with 68% of them saying they had experienced bullying and harassment. 'Dream job' Mr Wilkie is the first of current and former NHS Highland employees to have his case reviewed as a result of NHS Highland's healing process. He joined Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership as NHS Highland's head of human resources in the area in October 2017. He had more than 20 years' experience and had left Bolton NHS Foundation Trust to take up the job in Argyll and Bute. Mr Wilkie said he had thought it would be the ""dream job"" in a ""beautiful area"", but it turned a ""bizarre experience"" when he encountered bullying by some senior managers. He said: ""The first year things went really, really well and then around the summer of 2018 I started seeing some rather unusual behaviours."" Mr Wilkie said his decisions were undermined and people were removed from his team. He said: ""I felt that my own values were crossed. People who I could previously trust I could no longer trust. It damaged my mental health."" 'Made redundant' The strain led to him being signed off work and prescribed anti-depressants. Mr Wilkie said he returned to work in February 2019 to be told his role no longer existed. He said the decision to do this had not followed HR policy. While still working at the partnership, Mr Wilkie said he was intentionally ""overloaded"" and was then placed on special leave for six months during a period of reorganisations, before being made redundant. Mr Wilkie, who now lives and works in the north of England, said his experience took a toll on his personal life and his partner at the time. Following changes at senior level at NHS Highland, Mr Wilkie said he believed there would be positive changes at the health board. He is the latest employee at the Argyll and Bute partnership to speak out about bullying. In September, a doctor said she was bullied before losing her job after raising concerns about the closure of Argyll's only dementia assessment unit. Dr Jan Calder was a locum consultant psychiatrist with Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership. She said matters ""turned sour"" after she challenged the closure of the Knapdale Ward in Lochgilphead. The partnership declined to comment on Dr Calder's case, but said it treated bullying ""very seriously"". 'Sincere apology' Following Mr Wilkie's allegations, Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership said there was support available to staff. Chief officer Joanna Macdonald said: ""The health and wellbeing of staff is a priority for the organisation and earlier this year we established the healing process which enables former and current employees to access an independent team of external advisers to discuss their concerns about their experience of bullying and harassment. ""This is in addition to launching an Employee Assistance Programme and external Speak Up Guardian service for employees. ""Due to staff confidentiality it would not be appropriate for us to comment on individual employees either past or present who have participated in this process."" She said that following the results of its staff survey, the partnership had offered ""a sincere apology to colleagues who had indicated that they had experienced bullying and harassment and we immediately put in place a 100 day action plan to address the key findings"".

"By Eve RosatoBBC News NI Mr Hughes and his brother Ronan were named as suspects exactly one month ago after 39 Vietnamese nationals were found dead in a refrigerated lorry. At a public inquiry in Belfast, his firm - C Hughes Logistics Ltd - with an address in Armagh, had its licence to operate several vehicles revoked. Christopher Hughes did not attend. He was not represented at Friday's hearing in Belfast's Killymeal House. Christopher Hughes' lawyers, Logan and Corry Solicitors, had earlier asked for an adjournment but their request was denied. Their client previously held a HGV licence for the Republic of Ireland which was withdrawn in January 2016 because of infringements. Christopher Hughes also had a separate licence granted in Northern Ireland in 2015. Both licences allowed him to operate HGV vehicles across the EU in all member states. The revocation of his licence is related to the loss of his Republic of Ireland licence. It is possible to hold more than one licence. Mr Hughes should have informed authorities in Northern Ireland about the loss of his Republic of Ireland licence. He lost his Republic of Ireland licence because his drivers were driving for longer time periods than is legally allowed. Christopher Hughes, 34, and his 40-year-old brother Ronan are wanted for questioning by Essex Police on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking. Both men have links to Armagh in Northern Ireland and Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. John Martin from the Road Haulage Association (RHA) said that as a result of the public inquiry, Christopher Hughes' HGV vehicles ""should not be operating anywhere within the EU - in other words they should be taken off the road immediately."" He added that in other parts of the UK, public inquires over HGV licences happen regularly, but Friday's hearing appeared to be ""the first public inquiry to be held in Northern Ireland for a protracted period of time"". ""I couldn't say specifically, but probably at least three years,"" Mr Martin added. ""I think it's up to the Department [of Infrastructure] to give some insight in to the reason for holding this PI today, and was it linked in any way to the issues in Essex?"" The BBC has asked the Department of Infrastructure for a response.","Christopher Hughes, who is wanted by police in connection with the deaths of 39 people in a lorry in Essex, has lost his heavy goods vehicles (HGV) licence."
"It followed the conviction of 73-year-old John Allen of 33 sex offences in a campaign of abuse spanning decades. The man gave evidence in the trial of Allen for the historical abuse at the former homes in Wrexham known as the Bryn Alyn Community. In an interview with BBC Wales, he explained how Allen had groomed him, giving him gifts before he abused him. More than 20 years later, the man is still plagued by terrible dreams. ""The system really did fail us,"" said the man who cannot be identified. He described Bryn Alyn as a ""dumping ground"" for children who had arrived there under different circumstances. He first came to Allen's attention after he confided in another member of staff that other boys were allegedly forcing him to perform sex acts. Allen told him it would be alright and said: ""I will look after you."" Allen began buying him cigarettes, training shoes and taking him out. The vulnerable young man took it as a sign of affection when Allen began to touch him by putting his hand on his back or leg. But when Allen abused him, he pushed him away and threatened to alert his social worker. ""He panicked and he put Â£100 in everyone's clothing grant, took me out, bought me trainers. He would buy me loads of stuff,"" he said. ""It was quite horrible in there. It wasn't care, it was like hell,"" he added, recounting a time when boys were allegedly made to fight each other in a makeshift boxing ring made up of sofas put into a square. The victim only ever confided in one friend about the abuse he suffered as a boy but said it had had an effect on him throughout his life. The turning point was when he found a Facebook page for former Bryn Alyn residents which referred to Operation Pallial, an investigation launched by the National Crime Agency in 2012 into historical cases of child abuse in north Wales. ""It was Pallial that made me be able to talk about it. I really am really thankful to them,"" he said. ""I have terrible dreams, really bad ones when I am sweating in my sleep.

"The project features interviews with dozens of former paramilitaries. Previously, the PSNI gained access to material from the project relating to the 1972 murder of Jean McConville. Information from the recordings led to a series of arrests, including that of Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams. The PSNI said: ""Detectives in Serious Crime Branch have initiated steps to obtain all the material from Boston College as part of the Belfast Project. ""This is in line with the PSNI's statutory duty to investigate fully all matters of serious crime, including murder."" A spokesman for Boston College, Jack Dunn, said it had not received anything from the US Department of Justice and ""so it would be inappropriate to comment on speculation within Northern Ireland"". Breach of contract The project was designed as an oral history of the Troubles. Paramilitaries from the IRA and the Ulster Volunteer Force gave candid interviews to researchers employed by the university, on the understanding that their involvement would not be made public until after their deaths. The PSNI used a treaty between Britain and the United States to obtain material relating to Mrs McConville. Researchers fought the release of the interviews through the US courts. They maintained that it would represent a breach of contract and trust, and violate the ethical code on the protection of sources. Judge Young, who read the archive in order to determine which testimonies made reference to Mrs McConville, acceded to the PSNI request. He did, however, describe the project as ""a bone fide academic exercise of considerable merit"".",The Police Service of Northern Ireland has confirmed that it is seeking to obtain all material relating to Boston College's Belfast Project.
"By Tanya GuptaBBC News In the 1860s, in the farming community of Eastwood, 10 miles or so north of Sydney, an unusual apple tree could be seen growing along the banks of a creek. Its fruit was notable for its large size, light-green skin and suitability for both cooking and eating raw. The tree grew so abundant that its branches were later claimed to have been propped up to stop them breaking. How it originated is not known for certain. But according to legend, the tree grew from the discarded core of a crab apple thrown out of the kitchen window by a farmer's wife - one Maria Ann Smith. This legend is borne out, to some degree, by science. An entirely new variety of apple, such as Granny Smith, could only grow from cross-pollinated seeds within an apple, said Amanda Karlstrom, of UK horticultural research firm NIAB EMR. The parentage of the Granny Smith is thought to be possibly a cross between a cultivated apple and malus sylvestris, a crab apple. ""Therefore, Granny Smith is most likely a chance hybrid of two existing varieties and/or species,"" Ms Karlstrom explained. ""The clever bit that Ms Smith did was to identify the potential of her young plant, nurture the seedling and propagate it for wider apple production. ""This was certainly no mean feat as most people never get their young plants to the fruiting stage."" Could the real Granny Smith have brought this knowledge with her to Australia from the other side of the world? In 1838, the Lady Nugent had sailed into Sydney with nearly 50 emigrant families on board including the Smith family - Maria with her husband Thomas and their five surviving children. Back in England, the Smiths had lived in the village of Beckley, in Sussex, surrounded by the orchards of the Weald. It seems likely Maria had spent her life in in England on fruit farms, according to Prof Brian Short, of Sussex University. ""We definitely know Maria was from an area which had some specialism in apples,"" he said. ""And it's not a million miles away from Kent, which is apple country."" Records suggest Cherry Gardens, a farm in the area specialising in hops and pears, may have been tenanted by her father-in-law. However, conditions were tough in England in the 1820 and 30s and it appears the Smiths fell on hard times. The end of the Napoleonic Wars had led to a labour surplus and depressed wages for farm labourers. At the same time, increased mechanisation had reduced demand for agricultural labour. Poor, hungry and increasingly angry, rural families took action in the summer of 1830 as the Swing Riots broke out in neighbouring Kent and soon spread to Sussex. Sources: New South Wales Department of Primary Industries and the Australian Bureau of Statistics Beckley would have been right ""in the eye of the storm"", said Prof Short. It was ""one of the most pauperised parishes"" in the county, according to the guardians of the Rye Poor Law Union. ""We are in the greatest possible distress for want of labour at the Rye union board,"" wrote parish official Samuel Selmes. ""Yesterday we had upwards of 80 labourers out of employ and our houses [workhouses] are quite full."" The solution, officials decided, was to send people abroad. By November the parish had paid for about 200 people to be taken to Australia to begin new lives. Maria, Thomas and their five children were among them. A letter written decades later by Granny Smith's grandson, Benjamin Spurway, describes how the family found employment in Australia before taking on land for themselves and establishing an orchard. The letter has only recently come to light after lying undiscovered for decades. The land was heavily-timbered, he wrote. ""Much hard work, determination and courage were needed before the land was cleared, ploughed and cultivated and ready to make a fruit orchard, which they decided upon. ""The day came when their ambitions were realised and a beautiful orchard took the place of wilderness. ""Oranges and all kinds of fruit of that period were grown on the rich soil."" Spurway goes on to tell how Thomas Smith took on a market stall to sell the fruit but came back penniless after he stopped at the pub. At that point, Maria took over the stall. It was at the market another fruit producer gave her a batch of crab apples to test their cooking qualities. According to her grandson, she made two pies, dropped the peelings and cores out of the window, and the first Granny Smith seedling grew. The family records the first Granny Smith apple was produced in 1868, two years before she died. Later, the apple grew in popularity and went on to become one of Australia's major food exports. Today it is grown around the world. In Eastwood, which long ago became a suburb of Sydney, the bountiful fruit that made the area prosperous is still remembered. A Granny Smith festival has been held each year since 1985 and is attended by tens of thousands of people. However, the Smith family did not become rich. ""Fruit can't be patented, and I often think how rich we could have been if it had have been different,"" said Sue Butler, who is Maria's great-great-great-great-great granddaughter. ""But we are proud of its history.""","About 90,000 people are expected to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Granny Smith apple in Australia this weekend. But who was the English emigrant who gave her name to the famous fruit?"
"East Midlands Ambulance Service is considering replacing its 65 stations with 11 large hubs, 16 stations and 108 smaller community ambulance stations. A final decision is expected later in March. Earlier proposals had suggested 13 ambulance hubs and 118 smaller community ambulance posts. The ambulance service ran a public consultation in 2012 on the future of its infrastructure, but faced strong local opposition to the reduction in the number of ambulance stations. The new proposal, which emerged after the 2012 consultation, would mean some of the stations earmarked for closure would remain open. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said the proposal would allow paramedics to ""get to patients sooner"". EMAS held a series of workshops where it consulted staff, councillors, union representatives, patients and other people about the changes. Under the new proposal, the 11 hubs would be located at Chesterfield, Mansfield, Lincoln, Scunthorpe, Boston, Grantham, Nottingham, Derby, Leicester, Kettering and Northampton. The 16 stations would be located at Grimsby, Gainsborough, Louth, High Peak, Worksop, Skegness, Newark, Eastwood, Ashbourne, Sleaford, Ashby de la Zouch, Loughborough, Melton Mowbray, Market Deeping, Market Harborough and Hinckley. The hubs would be larger than existing stations and would contain maintenance facilities. The smaller community ambulance stations would only contain rest facilities - with some located in existing GP practices or fire stations.",A revised proposal on the future location of ambulance stations in the East Midlands has been released by the region's ambulance service.
"Officers searched his home in Berkshire after an allegation of a historical child sex assault, but prosecutors later said there would be no charges. The singer, 77, said the BBC's reporting, which involved a helicopter filming his home, was a ""very serious invasion"" of his privacy. A High Court judge is due to announce his ruling on Wednesday morning. South Yorkshire Police previously agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 and, according to his lawyers, the singer is seeking damages at the ""top end"" of the scale from the BBC. A trial was held at the High Court in London in April and May where the BBC disputed his claims. Corporation bosses said the coverage of the search of the apartment in Sunningdale, Berkshire, was accurate and in good faith. They said the broadcaster also reported Sir Cliff's ""full denial of the allegations at every stage"". Mr Justice Mann has heard that, in late 2013, a man made an allegation to the Metropolitan Police, saying he had been sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff during an event featuring evangelist Billy Graham at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane football stadium, in 1985, when he was a child. The allegation was passed on to South Yorkshire Police in July 2014 with the raid happening in August that year.

"By Ed LowtherPolitical reporter, BBC News British 1919 Amritsar Massacre, February 2013 During a visit to India David Cameron described the Amritsar massacre as ""a deeply shameful event in British history"". Writing in the memorial book of condolence, he added: ""We must never forget what happened here."" Although he did not offer a formal apology Mr Cameron was the first serving prime minister to pay his respects at the site in person. The death toll at the massacre in 1919 - when British riflemen opened fire to disperse a crowd - is disputed, with an inquiry by colonial authorities putting it at 379 and Indian sources putting it nearer to 1,000. The killings were condemned by the British at the time - War Secretary Winston Churchill described them as ""monstrous"" in 1920. Unnecessary deaths at Stafford Hospital, February 2013 Prime Minister David Cameron apologised to the families of patients who were subjected to years of abuse and neglect at Stafford Hospital. In a Commons statement on the outcome of a public inquiry into failings at the hospital, he said he was ""truly sorry"" for what had happened, which was ""not just wrong, it was truly dreadful"". The unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients were caused by failings that went right to the top of the health service, inquiry chairman Robert Francis QC had concluded. Mr Cameron announced that a new post of chief inspector of hospitals would be created in the autumn. Hillsborough disaster and cover-up, September 2012 David Cameron said he was ""profoundly sorry"" for what he called the double injustice of the Hillsborough disaster. He was addressing the House of Commons following an independent report into previously unseen documents about what happened on 15 April 1989. Ninety-six fans died as a consequence of the crush at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, which was hosting an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The report was compiled by the Hillsborough Independent Panel, which scrutinised more than 450,000 pages of documents over the course of 18 months. The medical advisor on the panel, Dr Bill Kirkup, said up to 41 of the 96 who died could have potentially been saved if they had received treatment earlier. The report also showed police and emergency services had made strenuous attempts to deflect the blame for the disaster on to fans. Mr Cameron said the safety of the crowds at Hillsborough had been ""compromised at every level"". Bloody Sunday killings, June 2010 Giving the UK government's response to the Saville Report, produced after a 12-year inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday, David Cameron said the killings that took place that day were unjustified and unjustifiable. He said he was ""deeply sorry"". Thirteen marchers were shot dead on 30 January 1972 in Londonderry when British paratroopers opened fire on crowds at a civil rights demonstration. Fourteen others were wounded; one later died. The report was heavily critical of the Army and found that soldiers fired the first shot. Child migrants sent abroad, February 2010 Gordon Brown apologised for the UK's role in sending more than 130,000 children to former colonies, where many suffered abuse. He expressed regret for the ""misguided"" Child Migrant Programme, announcing in the Commons that he was ""truly sorry"". He also announced a Â£6m fund to reunite families that were torn apart. The scheme sent poor children for a ""better life"" to countries like Canada and Australia from the 1920s to 1960s, but many were abused and lied to. ""We are sorry they were allowed to be sent away at the time when they were most vulnerable. We are sorry that instead of caring for them, this country turned its back,"" he told MPs. Alan Turing's prosecution, September 2009 Gordon Brown said he was sorry for the ""appalling"" way World War II code-breaker Alan Turing was treated for being gay. A petition on the No 10 website had called for a posthumous government apology to the pioneer who made significant contributions to the emerging fields of artificial intelligence and computing. In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for gross indecency after admitting a sexual relationship with a man. He was given experimental chemical castration as a ""treatment"", and subsequently committed suicide. He is most famous for his code-breaking work at Bletchley Park during WWII, helping to create the Bombe that cracked messages enciphered with the German Enigma machines. Slavery, March 2007 Tony Blair said sorry for the slave trade, not long before the 200th anniversary of its abolition. His previous statement of ""deep sorrow"" had been criticised for stopping short of a full apology. ""I have said we are sorry and I say it again,"" he said after talks with Ghanaian president John Agyekum Kufuor. The most important thing was ""to remember what happened in the past, to condemn it and say why it was entirely unacceptable,"" Mr Blair said. Guildford Four miscarriage of justice, June 2000 Tony Blair apologised to the Guildford Four, who were wrongfully convicted of IRA bomb attacks in England in 1974. In a letter, Mr Blair acknowledged the ""miscarriage of justice"" which they suffered as a result of their wrongful convictions. Paul Hill, Gerry Conlon, Patrick Armstrong and Carole Richardson, were given life sentences for bombing public houses in Guildford, Surrey. Each of them spent 15 years in prison before the convictions were overturned by the Court of Appeal in 1989.","David Cameron has described the Amritsar massacre as a ""deeply shameful event"". Although he stopped short of a formal apology, it joins a number of other events - which predate their arrival in No 10 - that UK prime ministers have tackled in recent years."
"Sally-Ann Fricker said she was out shopping in Bath with her daughter and her two young boys when a pigeon landed in front of them. She broke off a corner of the snack and threw it to the bird which immediately flew off with the morsel. Bath and North East Somerset Council said anyone caught littering faced a Â£150 fixed penalty fine. However, councillor Dave Wood said they would be reviewing the action taken by the contractor ""to determine whether it was proportionate"". Ms Fricker's daughter, Toni Bradley, said her mother was approached ""seconds later"" by the enforcement officer after throwing the food. He told her she would be fined Â£150, but this would be reduced to Â£100 if she paid it within 14 days. ""If she'd chucked the wrapper down then that would have been fair enough, but this was absolutely ridiculous, we were very upset and very shocked,"" Ms Bradley said. ""My mum's a carer and the fine is more money than she gets in a week."" ""When I got home my three-year-old asked me to take down the bird feeder from the garden 'because nanny got into trouble' for feeding them,"" she added. Mr Wood, who is the cabinet member for climate change and the environment, said: ""Councils and their contractors should use common sense in dealing with cases like this.

"By Roz Tappenden & Linda SerckBBC News Actor Georgia Frost says she was recently refused service by two consecutive barbers in west London, something she found humiliating. ""I was working on a show at the Lyric Hammersmith and needed just the back and sides doing, partly for the show,"" she says. ""When I asked to have my hair cut, the barber just laughed in my face and said 'no' and made some remark about me being a woman."" She tried again at a near-empty establishment a short distance away only to be told, ""we don't do women here"". ""I pointed to the client and said, 'I'm literally asking for this haircut that you're doing now' and he just said 'no'. I think for a long time people have seen the barber's as a male sanctuary where they don't have to deal with women. I also think it ties in with what people believe a woman should look like. ""Hair is a huge part of queer culture and lesbian identity as well, so I can't help but feel there is some homophobia wrapped up in all these refusals I've had."" If being denied a haircut based on gender seems clearly discriminatory, there's also the issue that at salons that do offer a unisex service, there's still often a price list that shows one fee for women and a much cheaper one for men. The National Hair & Beauty Federation (NHBF) points out that women usually have more complicated haircuts than men, and so are charged more. Chief executive Hilary Hall says: ""This is because men tend to have shorter hair, require haircuts which are technically quicker to deliver, do not typically include the range of products used for women and require less time for finishing. For example, a bob may be viewed as a short style, but it is more technically challenging than a short back and sides."" She insists the price difference is not based on gender. ""A salon or barber-shop will set its prices taking the following into consideration: the length and texture of the client's hair, the time the service takes, the type of service requested, the products the salon or barber-shop will use, and the skills, training and level of experience required by the stylist or barber."" While some men do want complex and time-consuming haircuts, the rise of barber-shops - the NHBF says there's been a 64% increase in five years - suggests that a straightforward and cheap haircut is a popular option. However, this is an option that can be closed off to women, as Trish Greenhalgh has experienced. The University of Oxford academic says for years she was charged Â£37 by the same salon stylist and ""found it irritating"" as the short, dry cut, with no shampooing or gelling, took about five minutes. ""Last time I went in, the woman stylist had left but the man said he'd do me as the new lady hadn't started yet,"" she says. ""He charged me Â£15. Same cut, took the same amount of time and looked exactly the same. I showed him a photo and he copied it."" Prof Greenhalgh says her experience highlights a sexist issue. ""For the tomboys among us who really do just want a quick cut, we should be able to ask for an identical service to men. What's currently happening is all women are being charged for the average haircut for a woman."" There are salons that do offer gender-neutral pricing, such as Butchers in Hackney, east London. ""Historically, in our industry there has been a gap between the price charged for men and women,"" co-founder Susannah Jones says. ""This was based on the belief that men have short hair, which is quick and simple to style, and women have long hair, which takes more time and skill. This is simply not the case. ""Short haircuts can actually be more technical and often take longer, so time wasn't even a factor when we used to charge less for men - it was purely because they were male, which felt morally wrong."" She says she hopes other salons will ""see the value of removing gender from their services"" and help ""reduce the perception that prices vary according to gender"" by being ""more transparent to clients that time is a key factor when setting prices"". Karen Waldron, owner of the Barber Shop Group, set up the unisex chain Cut UK because she spotted a ""missing element"" - a place for both men and women, a walk-in, no-appointment service, where the prices are the same for both genders. Her stylists are trained to do barber cuts as well as more technical cuts, so all styles are catered for. ""The main issue about the barber-shop and the lovely tradition with it is that it is for men and only meant to be men,"" she says. ""It's only in the last five years that I've allowed women who come in with an absolute man's cut - clippers, neck shaved with a cut-throat, et cetera. We can't be fussy any more now there are so many barber-shops."" But unisex barbers are far from the norm, and many businesses are still refusing to serve women, despite the Equalities Act saying service providers should not discriminate. Research consultant Devon Magliozzi says she booked with a barber in Edinburgh but received an email 20 minutes before her appointment saying, ""we no longer specialise in women's grooming"". ""I called the barber-shop. I asked if they could just do a clipper cut on the back and sides but they reiterated that they couldn't do a woman's haircut,"" she says. ""I understand that barbers might not have training to cut long hair, or might charge extra for cuts that take extra time, but gender is an arbitrary way to define services and set prices."" Equality lawyer Elizabeth McGlone, who has a short haircut herself, says discrimination by hair service providers has never been challenged in the courts. ""Both hairdressers and barbers are covered as a service provider under the Equalities Act so they cannot discriminate on the grounds of gender unless it's a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim,"" she says. ""If you wanted to pursue it, you would have to bring a civil action under the discrimination provision under section 29 at the county court,"" says Ms McGlone, of London-based Bindmans solicitors. ""I haven't come across any law against gender-based pricing and it can be argued that women's hair is not straightforward or it takes longer. When there is a price difference, there's going to be something about the fact that there's more time spent."" She adds: ""I take the choice to go to the barber's because it's cheaper. Men should not be treated favourably because of sex and if you turn a woman away, you are going to make that woman feel totally embarrassed."" Based on her experiences, it's a sentiment Georgia Frost would agree with. ""I like the intricacy and finish clippers and a good barber gives me,"" she says. ""Also, I am not paying Â£40 at a hairdresser's for short back and sides - it's just ridiculous.""","It's accepted as a fact of life that women pay more for their haircuts than men. But why are women who want a simple, short cut being turned away by barbers - and is this even lawful?"
"HMP Full Sutton near York is home to murderer Dale Cregan, serial killer Dennis Nilsen, and last month a prison officer was taken hostage there.

Prison-made bread Paul Middleton, chairman of Full Sutton and Skirpenbeck Parish Council, said there had not been a shop in the village for hundreds of years. ""The prison isn't going to go anywhere, so we may as well try to use it to help the village,"" he said. ""When you're up there you wouldn't know there were 600 dangerous criminals inside, it's very peaceful, and the visitors who'll be in the visitor centre are just normal people."" And Mr Middleton said they would be making use of the prison's resources. ""The prisoners make bread, old fashioned loaves without any additives, and we're going to sell that in the shop, and they also make recycled barbecue briquettes which we're going to sell. ""People in the village are pleased there's going to be a shop. ""I think some have reservations and say because it's in the prison they will never go. It'll take time but we want to build those bridges.""

"By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter Vote Leave paid Â£625,000 to clear bills allegedly run up by a university student with a Canadian digital agency days ahead of last June's referendum. The Electoral Commission says it has no grounds to suspect this was an illegal scheme to get round spending limits. But a group of campaigning lawyers says the watchdog failed to do its job. The Good Law Project, run by Jo Maugham QC, is attempting to secure a judicial review of the Commission's decision in the High Court. The allegations centre on Darren Grimes, at the time a fashion student at the University of Brighton, who set up a group called BeLeave, to give young pro-Brexit campaigners a voice during last year's referendum. 'Acceptable method' As a registered campaigner, Mr Grimes was allowed to spend up to Â£700,000. He initially spent very little but in the 10 days leading up to the 23 June vote he ran up a Â£675,315 bill with Aggregate IQ Data, a Canadian marketing firm that specialises in political campaigns, according to the Electoral Commission database. Money to clear the bill was not given to Mr Grimes but sent directly to Aggregate IQ by Vote Leave, which separately spent Â£2.7m with the same firm, more than a third of its Â£6.8m budget. Mr Grimes also received Â£50,000 from an individual Vote Leave donor in the final 10 days, making the previously obscure campaigner's group one of the best-funded at the referendum. Campaign director Dominic Cummings is quoted on Aggregate IQ's website as saying ""we couldn't have done it without them"". In total, AIQ was given Â£3.5m by groups campaigning for Brexit, including Vote Leave, the Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain, which received a Â£100,000 donation from Vote Leave. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit if it had spent the money it donated on behalf of Mr Grimes itself. The campaign group said it made the donation to Mr Grimes because it was coming up to its Â£7m spending limit and wanted a way of using Â£9.2m it had raised from individuals and companies on campaigning activities. The Electoral Commission says this is an ""acceptable method of donating under the rules"". It only becomes a potential offence when there is evidence of a ""common plan or arrangement"" on how the money is spent, to prevent campaigns from setting up front groups to get round spending limits. The watchdog says campaigners on the same side of the argument ""can liaise and discuss campaigning approaches without meeting the threshold of joint spending within the meaning of the legislation"". And ""after a detailed look at this matter"" it did not find reasonable grounds to suspect an offence had been committed by Vote Leave or Mr Grimes. 'Wholly implausible' But in a nine page ""pre-action letter"", threatening legal proceedings against the Electoral Commission, the Good Law Project claims the watchdog made an ""error of law"". The project claims it is ""wholly implausible,"" based on the evidence seen by the Electoral Commission, that Mr Grimes and Vote Leave did not work together. Mr Grimes, who is now deputy editor of the Brexit Central website, did not respond to requests for a comment. He has previously said: ""Vote Leave had no say or input in our strategy or our campaign spending."" Matthew Elliott, who was Vote Leave's chief executive and is now editor-at-large of Brexit Central, was not available for comment. Mr Maugham, a former Labour Party member who campaigned for Remain in last year's referendum, insisted he was not motivated by a desire to undermine Brexit. He said there was ""no evidence one way or another"" that the referendum might have turned out differently if Vote Leave had been prevented from donating to Mr Grimes. But he said he was concerned that the Electoral Commission was ""asleep on the job"" and not fulfilling its role of preventing democracy from being ""captured"" by those with big money to spend. ""Too many of our regulatory agencies are managed and governed by people who are there because they will not rock the boat. I think it is a systemic problem,"" he added. Investigations An Electoral Commission spokesman said: ""We assessed whether payments made to Aggregate IQ, by Vote Leave on behalf of Mr Grimes, was in fact spending with him under a 'common plan'. ""If it was, it should have been reported by Vote Leave as part of their spending and would have needed to be within their spending limit. ""However, the evidence we saw was consistent with these being donations to Mr Grimes, which he reported, and not spending under a common plan. Consequently we did not have grounds to investigate further. ""We have written to the Good Law Project explaining why in our view they have failed to provide any new, credible evidence that would call into question our decision."" In April, the Electoral Commission launched a separate investigation into spending during the referendum by Leave.EU, the campaign backed by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage and donor Arron Banks. It is also investigating spending by the anti-Brexit campaign Britain Stronger in Europe. The Good Law Project has accused the watchdog of dragging its feet over the Leave.EU investigation and is demanding a statement on what stage it has reached and ""reasons for the delay"".",The Electoral Commission is facing possible legal action over its decision to drop an investigation into Vote Leave's Brexit campaign spending.

"By Carolyn Hitt and Peter ShuttleworthBBC Wales News But for Ruth Longford, David Lloyd George is considered a grandfather - a legacy of one of the most astonishing tales of extra-marital affairs involving a British prime minster. Her mother is said to be the illegitimate child of 'The Welsh Wizard', still the only Welshman ever to become the prime minister. As Ms Longford's grandmother Frances Stevenson was mistress of 30 years and private secretary to the politician. It is the sort of scandal that today would end a political career. But a century ago, it remained on of the House of Commons' best-kept secrets. And even when the philandering politician had a love child when leader of the Liberal party in 1929, the cover-up to seemingly protect Lloyd George's reputation was as elaborate as it was incomprehensible. Only Ms Stevenson's name was on baby Jennifer's birth certificate and the new mother put her new-born up for adoption - before promptly adopting her back. All seemingly to keep the name of the MP for the Caernarfon Boroughs away from any formal paperwork. ""My mother wasn't completely sure who her father was,"" Ms Longford admitted to BBC Radio Wales' Lloyd George and his Women programme. Not only because of Lloyd George's absence on the official documents. There was another twist. Ms Stevenson was, herself, having an affair. Army officer Colonel Thomas Tweed, who also worked in Lloyd George's office, could have been the father. But Ms Longford insisted: ""My mum was brought up by Frances and Lloyd George. ""She loved him to pieces. She'd prefer him to be the father than the possible alternative."" In his programme tracing the life of his great-great-grandfather, historian Dan Snow acknowledged Lloyd George ""was the kind of man that fell in love three times a day."" The young lawyer had married Margaret Owen, the daughter in a well-off farming family, aged 25 in 1888 - just two years before he started his 55-year career as an MP. He had numerous affairs - even with wives of fellow Liberal MPs - before settling down with Ms Stevenson in 1914. She had been a personal tutor to Lloyd George's daughter Megan and was a governess at Wimbledon Boarding School before being invited to become his private secretary and most trusted political confidante. ""She was 22 and he was 49 when they met,"" said Ms Longford. ""He said if you work for me, I won't be able to avoid making you my mistress. So she knew the terms and at that time it was hard to get very interesting jobs. ""She had been totally bored being a teacher in a small girls' school and suddenly she was going to be private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer - where all of the action was. She was very thrilled by that. ""So it was a double attraction - he was attractive and the life she was suddenly imagining before her was going to be really interesting. I could see how that would be amazingly attractive. ""She did have a huge crush on him. She might have been able to resist if he hadn't told her he needed her. But she came running."" Within two years of the affair beginning, Lloyd George was leading Britain's war effort as Secretary of State for War and was about to become PM. But there was another twist. His lover was pregnant. ""My grandmother was very discreet about it,"" said Ms Longford. ""But she once bitterly said to my mother, precautions don't always work. There's a point in her diary where she is talking about the excitement of having his son and then she's saying we've agreed it cannot be. ""She made it stop happening. She never openly said 'yeah, I had an abortion' but we think there were a couple of instances where she definitely had to stop something."" While the private secretary and the politician continued their affair in hullaballoo of London, Lloyd George's wife continued bringing up the family in the Gwynedd village of Llanystumdwy on the Llyn Peninsula. Ms Stevenson was at Lloyd George's side when the British premier negotiated peace at the Treaty of Versailles following the allied victory in World War One. Lloyd George resigned from Number 10 in 1922 as the coalition Government crumbled. The next challenge was the prospect of a love child - and this one Ms Stevenson was desperate to keep. ""Categorically she definitely seemed to have planned it,"" said Ms Longford. ""Frances was in her 40s and Lloyd George was not in power and things were not going particularly well. ""She must have known she didn't have much more time for a child and she wrote to him 'if what we hope happened, has happened I'll let you know with no exchanges' which sounds like she's telling him she must be pregnant. Ms Stevenson became Mrs Lloyd George following his first wife's death during the Second World War. But within 15 months, the man she lovingly called 'LG' was dead. And with it went one of Whitehall's most unbelievable episodes. Lloyd George and his Women is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 11 December at 12:30 GMT",To some he was the greatest figure in Welsh history. A man who inspired Britain in World War One and was regarded as the architect of the welfare state.
"Environment Secretary Owen Paterson will raise the issue with senior officials from the Obama administration this week. Scottish producers had asked Mr Paterson to take action when he visited the Royal Highland Show in Edinburgh earlier this month. Haggis imports have been outlawed in the US since 1971. The ban was put in place because the country's food standards agency prohibits sheep lungs - one of the key ingredients of haggis - in food products. The US visit comes as Scotch Beef is set to make a return to menus in America for the first time in almost 20 years. It follows a move by US officials to reopen the American market to EU beef and other bovine products, following a ban put in place in the 1990s over concerns that BSE could infect the human food chain. Mr Paterson's visit is the latest attempt by British politicians to get haggis back on American menus. Several years ago, Scottish Rural Affairs Secretary Richard Lochhead raised the issue with the US, but the ban remained in place. Mr Paterson will hold talks with his US opposite number, Tom Vilsack, in Washington on Monday, in an attempt to open up a market which is potentially worth millions of pounds to Scottish producers. The haggis market is already worth about Â£15m in the UK alone. 'Wonderful national dish' Mr Paterson said: ""I share many haggis producers' disappointment that American diners are currently unable to enjoy the taste of Scotland's wonderful national dish in their own country. ""I am meeting my US counterpart today to discuss how we can begin exporting it, particularly as so many Americans enjoy celebrating their Scottish heritage."" ""This government has opened many markets for our home-grown food and drink businesses. ""I will continue to do everything I can to boost exports of everything from whisky to haggis to support Scotland's farmers and rural economy."" During his visit, Mr Paterson will also ask for Scottish lamb to be allowed back into America, following a ban imposed in 1989. The UK government said it hoped the ban could be lifted as part of an EU-US trade deal, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which is currently being negotiated. Responding to Mr Paterson's visit to the US, Scottish Food Secretary Richard Lochhead said: ""With almost nine million Americans claiming Scots ancestry, there is clearly an appetite in the US for haggis made to traditional recipes. ""We look forward to the USA resuming imports of Scotch Beef and are optimistic that this will pave the way for the resumption of imports of other iconic Scottish products such as haggis and Scotch Lamb. ""The US has long been a top priority market for the Scottish food and drink sector. ""I have been pushing for this development for years - therefore I welcome Owen Paterson's efforts to open up this lucrative market, even if it's taken the forthcoming referendum to get his attention."" While in the US, Mr Paterson will also promote British food and drink products at the Summer Fancy Food Show in New York, where brands like Walkers Shortbread have entered the American specialist food market.",The UK government is making a fresh bid to overturn a decades-long US import ban on traditional Scottish haggis.
"Aberdeen City Council said there were 134 empty teaching posts in the city. The council admitted consideration would have to be given to shutting the worst-affected schools after the summer unless the situation improves. The Scottish government said education secretary John Swinney would be in Aberdeen on Monday to hear directly from those involved in education. Aberdeen education convener Angela Taylor said: ""This is a national problem but there is no doubt that Aberdeen is a special case because of the high cost of living plus the oil and gas crisis. ""The first minister seems to concede that this city is a special case but as far as I'm concerned, Aberdeen is being left to twist in the wind given the precious little support we have been given. Ms Taylor called on the Scottish government to act urgently. She added: ""If they continue to ignore our pleas for action, there is a danger that after the summer holidays we may have to consider closing those schools worst affected by this crisis."" Aberdeen targets The Scottish government said it wanted all schools to have access to the right number of teachers so every child has the opportunity to fulfil their potential. A spokesman said: ""Last year we invested Â£51m to safeguard teacher posts and increased student teacher numbers in each of the last five years, specifically targeting places at the University of Aberdeen."" He added: ""Through the Transition Training Fund we are committed to helping oil and gas sector staff move to a career in teaching, particularly in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) subjects, and we are supporting the University of Aberdeen's distance learning teacher education programme, which allows council employees to retrain as teachers while staying in work. ""Mr Swinney will be in Aberdeen on Monday to hear directly from education directors, head teachers and teachers from Aberdeen and other parts of the north of Scotland to hear about the challenges they're facing and opportunities moving forward.""","A warning has been issued that some schools in Aberdeen may close because of a ""crisis"" in recruiting teachers."
"By Jenny ColemanBBC News, Ellesmere Port General Motors (GM) said it would invest Â£125m in the Vauxhall factory in Ellesmere Port and spend about Â£1bn in the UK component sector. It means the car factory will build at least 160,000 Astra cars a year, in a deal that secures the future of the plant and protects thousands of jobs. Supply chain worker Mike Farley, 35, from Prenton, Wirral, said everyone was ""sky high"" at the plant. ""Instead of shutting the plant down it means we are guaranteed work until 2020. ""There had been a cloud over everyone for the last six months and that had lifted. It has taken the pressure off everyone. ""We are all really happy with the agreement."" 'Motivated workforce' In March, many analysts feared that with GM's European unit sustaining heavy losses, Ellesmere Port would close. The deal to make the new Astra followed a vote by more than 2,100 Vauxhall staff in favour of a new pay and conditions deal. The plant will now go to three-shift working with more than 700 new staff being taken on. Assistant plant manager Paul Gledhill praised the workforce for their commitment and agreeing to more flexible working practices. ""We had been expecting bad news after rumours in December. ""Credit to the workforce, they remained motivated and it made a difference. ""Over 90% voted for plant flexibility, meaning that the length of working week will extend from 37 to 40 hours, we will introduce a third shift and [stay open] for 51 weeks a year rather than 46. Mr Gledhill, 48, who has two sons working at the plant, said it was ""about making the plant efficient"". 'Best in Europe' Production of the new Astra will begin at the Cheshire plant in 2015 and continue until at least 2020. John Fetherston of the Unite union said the deal was a ""saviour"" for the town. ""If we hadn't got the new Astra, there would have been no Ellesmere Port. ""But we won the bid, we are building it, and now we want to build the next Astra and the Astra after that in volumes that make sure that we have got a viable future."" Paul Hannon, 48, from Rock Ferry, Wirral, has been a team leader at the plant for 16 years. He said it was ""fantastic news"". ""It's a great place to work. It means security and we deserve it because it is the best plant in Europe."" He added: ""It will take me to retirement so I am made up. ""It's great news for youngsters starting out as there will be opportunities here now with work being granted for the next eight years. ""No-one makes better than the British."" Barbara Murray, 36, from New Ferry, Wirral, has been working at the factory for 14 years. ""It's a great place to work. I have two young children and it's good to know I will be able to keep supporting them. ""It's worrying when you read the news about the plant closing but I can relax now I know we are OK."" The plant celebrates its 50th year of production this year. When it first opened in 1962, it had 12,500 staff.",Workers at a Cheshire car factory under threat of closure spoke of their relief and jubilation after the owner announced a deal to build the new Vauxhall Astra.

"Thousands of Scots started moving to Corby, Northamptonshire, in the 1930s to work on iron and steelwork sites. The ballot will be held at next month's Highland Gathering, with the vote being verified by event organisers. Organiser Mark Pengelly said the vote was ""a bit of fun"" but could set the tone for the national vote. Many Scottish families remained in Corby despite the collapse of iron and steelwork sites in the area, leading to the town becoming known as ""little Scotland"". 'A lot of interest' Corby Borough Council had campaigned to give its residents a say on Scotland's future, but it proved unsuccessful with only those permanently living in the country eligible to vote. Mr Pengelly, a Labour councillor, said there was much resentment to this in the town, with many people concerned about what a ""Yes"" vote could mean to the rights of Scottish people living in England. But he felt a mock vote would ""give them a voice"" and could provide an interesting insight into how the overall vote might go. ""Corby has a lot of Scottish traditions. The vote won't mean anything, but it will certainly create a lot of interest,"" said Mr Pengelly. A Better Together campaign spokesman said expatriate Scots may not have a vote but ""they have a voice"". They should make contact with family and friends in Scotland and persuade them to reject independence, he said. A Yes Scotland spokesperson said: ""We understand why expats are keen to get involved in the referendum debate and indeed would encourage people to engage. However, residency determines eligibility to vote.""

"The Ministry of Justice says only a fifth eligible for ""home detention curfew"" are currently being released. The move may reduce pressure on prison numbers - but the type of offenders the scheme covers is not being changed. It applies to terms of between three months and four years and excludes sex, weapon and certain other offences. Foreign national prisoners and people convicted of violent offences, terrorism, or those who have previously breached a curfew are also excluded. The scheme - introduced by Labour in 1999 - sees prisoners freed between two weeks and four-and-a-half months before their automatic release date. They are made to wear a tag and abide by a curfew. 'Not an expansion' Figures released this week show the total population of prisons and immigration removal centres remains high at 84,255, under an overall capacity of 86,771. There are currently 2,770 people subject to home detention curfew (HDC). The Ministry of Justice says simplifying the administration of the system will reduce delays, and increase the numbers released. In an instruction to prison governors the MoJ said only 21% of offenders eligible for the scheme are being released. The MoJ said it wanted the curfews to be ""a normal part of release"". It also wants governors to review cases where home detention curfew has been refused, often because the address inmates plan to move to is deemed unsuitable. The MoJ said: ""We are not expanding the scheme to allow the release of any prisoner who was not already eligible and could be released on HDC. ""We are simplifying the HDC process, reducing the number of forms used in the assessment process and maintaining the strict eligibility and suitability tests. ""This will mean governors can make well-informed, more timely decisions and ensure robust risk management plans are in place for offenders released under the scheme.""",More offenders could be freed from prison in England and Wales with an electronic tag under government plans to simplify an early-release scheme.

"Expected to be in place for a year, the charge has risen from Â£11.50 to Â£15 and will now be enforced everyday from 07:00-22:00. It is one of the conditions of a recent Â£1.6bn bailout deal between Transport for London and the government. However, the emergency services, NHS and care workers will still have the charge reimbursed. Residents applying for a discount have until 1 August to submit their applications. TfL said data showed the number of cars in the zone was the same as before lockdown began in March. It said as the government further eased lockdown restrictions, traffic levels could double if people who would have used public transport chose to drive instead. This would mean there would not be enough space on the streets to accommodate the increased amount of walking and cycling needed in order to enable people to socially distance, TfL said.",The congestion charge for people driving into central London has now increased by 30 per cent.
"Children's play centres can also reopen but areas which are not easy to clean, such as ball pits, must remain shut. The Welsh Government said the businesses are legally required ""to minimise the risk of exposure to coronavirus"" on their premises. Councils will be given extra powers to enforce the requirements. They include ensuring people maintain a two-metre distance where possible and measures to avoid close interaction when it is not, such as installing screens, using face coverings and improving hygiene. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""For the small minority of individuals and businesses who are not complying with the law, I want to make it clear that we will take action and we won't hesitate to close individual premises if that is necessary. ""Local authorities are being given enhanced powers to intervene, and to respond more effectively to complaints including those reported to the Wales TUC and its affiliated unions."" While gyms and leisure centres will be able to open from Monday, they will look very different to before the start of the pandemic. Saunas and steam rooms will remain closed, equipment will be more spread out due to social-distancing measures, while swimmers are being asked to arrive at the pool side ""swim ready"". 'Some will be there first thing' At the start of lockdown, people were limited to exercising outside once a day, not allowed to travel except for essential reasons, and were unable to exercise in groups. ""I went from working 14-hour days to nothing,"" said personal trainer Francesca Ray, who would normally train clients at Simply Gym, in Llansamlet. The Swansea-based trainer signed up for a 100-mile running challenge and tried to keep clients motivated, and once restrictions were eased started training people outside. Ms Ray said while she had organised boot camps and helped people with one-on-one training during lockdown, many people could not wait to get back into the habit of going to the gym. ""I don't think a lot of people realised how much of a positive impact exercise has on their daily lives until the luxury of a gym was taken away from us,"" she said. But she said despite social-distancing measures and hygiene measures in place, some were worried about going back. ""I have some clients who will be there 05:30 on Monday morning desperate to use the equipment and others who are slightly apprehensive about returning,"" she said. In Rhondda Cynon Taff the council is preparing to reopen its gyms, with fitness classes resuming on 17 August and swimming pools from 24 August. People heading back to the Leisure for Life gyms will have to book personal training sessions and classes in advance, with fewer people in classes and social distancing measures in place. Ann Crimmings, cabinet member for leisure, said while outdoor classes ""had been a hit"", the weather had not always been ""on their side"". ""Staff have worked hard over recent weeks to ensure staff and customers can return to a safe, but very different, environment,"" she said. ""The phased approach to opening is the safest way of ensuring the buildings can safely cope with customers wishing to exercise."" 'I can't wait to get back in the pool' For triathlete Caroline Tinsley, not being able to go to her local swimming pool has been hard during the last few months. After the local travel restrictions were lifted the member of Caerphilly Tri-ers, who has competed in Ironman Wales, started swimming in the sea. But having to swim around tide times and making sure a friend was free to swim with her for safety reasons, meant this was more restricted than going to her local pool in Cardiff. ""I've been able to cycle and run as normal, but have really missed the pool,"" she said. ""It seems crazy that it's taken so long to open pools seeing as they are essentially baths full of disinfectant designed to kill germs,"" she said. ""Much of the risk comes from the changing rooms, so being asked to arrive 'beach ready' removes much of the fear factor. I can't wait to get back in the pool"". Conservative Senedd member Darren Millar, who speaks on Covid-19 recovery matters, welcomed the latest easing of the lockdown but said he wanted it to happen on Saturday, two days earlier. ""Weekends provide many working people with important opportunities to take advantage of leisure facilities,"" he said. ""It's a great shame that the Welsh Government has chosen to implement these changes from Monday, rather than tomorrow, as it will result in yet another lost weekend for everyone involved.""","The planned reopening of swimming pools, fitness studios, gyms and leisure centres will go ahead on Monday, it has been confirmed."
"The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) found that the number of people looking to buy a home in February increased at the slowest rate since April last year. Statistics showed that a lack of properties for sale meant that house prices continued to rise. However, the report expects the market to pick up over the summer months. Rics' latest residential market survey suggests the initial surge in demand driven by the more accessible housing market had started to ease off slowly. A net balance of 24% of surveyors reported a growth in inquiries from people looking to make a purchase. The comparable figure for January was a 34% net balance of surveyors, while December recorded a 52% balance. 'Lack of properties' Statistics in the survey also suggest the number of homes being placed on the market for sale failed to pick up and supply was still ""falling well short of required levels"". This lack of available properties helped continue the rise in house prices last month, with a balance of 45% more chartered surveyors reporting prices increasing rather than falling. This increase means that the cost of a home has now risen across Scotland for 10 months in a row. Rics Scotland director Sarah Speirs said: ""The growth in buyer numbers that we've seen for some months started to slow down in February, as the surge in interest sparked towards the end of last summer began to level off."" She added: ""While this does not mean an end to the increasing activity we've been seeing recently, it does suggest that the pent-up demand generated throughout the downturn is gradually exhausting itself.""","The growth in Scotland's housing market has slowed to its lowest rate in a year, according to surveyors."
"Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said she believed Scotland's ""direction of travel"" was towards independence. But she said this could be ""put aside"" in the short term as she seeks ""consensus and compromise"" over Brexit. Opposition parties want Ms Sturgeon to rule out a second referendum. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted the UK to retain membership of the European single market, the so-called soft Brexit option. If the UK as a whole was to leave the market, she has set out terms on which Scotland could potentially stay in, but these would require new powers being devolved to Holyrood. Voters in Scotland backed the UK staying in the EU by 62% to 38%. Ms Sturgeon said she favoured Scotland remaining in the European Union as an independent country, and her government is currently consulting on a draft bill for a second independence referendum. However, she acknowledged that ""in terms of the timetable of Brexit"" the prospect of Scottish independence could be taken off the table if a soft exit could be achieved. 'Additional powers' She said: ""We want to try to work with others across the UK, across the political spectrum, to try to keep the UK in the single market."" Ms Sturgeon said if that could not be done then her government had put forward a plan to UK ministers detailing how Scotland could retain membership of the single market, that includes devolving powers over areas including immigration and employment law to Holyrood. She added: ""I think there's a lot of consensus starting to build around some of those additional powers, for example around immigration. ""We've put forward very detailed plans about how we avoid a hard Brexit and the reason it's important to avoid a hard Brexit, let's not forget, is because that will have a devastating impact on our economy and on jobs. ""So I'm in a sense willing to put aside my preferred option of independence in the EU to see if we can explore a consensus and compromise option."" When pressed on the question of a second independence referendum being taken ""off the table"" in the event of a soft Brexit, Ms Sturgeon added: ""In terms of the timescale of Brexit, that's what I've been very clear about. ""Am I going to stop arguing for independence or believing in independence? Am I going to stop believing that Scotland is on a journey to independence? ""No, but we're talking here about the particular context and timescale of Brexit - and I'm putting these proposals forward in good faith. I'm deliberately saying, 'put my preferred option to one side' and asking people if we can find a consensus and compromise option."" Analysis by BBC Scotland political reporter Philip Sim Nicola Sturgeon suggests that a ""soft"" Brexit could see the prospect of Scottish independence recede, at least in the short term. But is such a soft Brexit likely? Based on the current rhetoric out of Westminster, it's hard to say so with any confidence. At the moment, Brexit provides the most likely trigger for a second independence referendum. Effectively Ms Sturgeon is accepting that if the conditions set out in the Brexit plan she published in December are met, then it would make pulling that trigger more difficult to justify. But again - how likely is this? If you need a hint about what Ms Sturgeon thinks, immediately after her appearance on Radio Scotland, the first minister retweeted a newspaper front page stating that the ""UK faces a very hard Brexit"". She later added that it was a ""reasonable assessment"" to suggest that indyref2 is currently more likely than a soft Brexit. This is another measure to pile pressure on Theresa May's government over the ""compromise"" deal set out by the Scottish government. Indications of how likely it is to be accepted should emerge as the prime minister's Brexit plans become clearer. John Curtice, a professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told the BBC's World at One programme that Ms Sturgeon had changed her tone, if not her position on Brexit. He said: ""She has indicated since 23 June that should her vision of Brexit be realised, at least for Scotland, then she wouldn't necessarily hold the [independence] referendum. ""Today has seen the tone of being willing to say 'the referendum may not happen' is perhaps a bit more explicit. But what she wasn't asked is what would happen if she were not to get the version of Brexit she is looking for - given how soft the version of Brexit she's looking for is, there must be a pretty high probability that she won't get what she wants."" Mr Curtice added that with current polling ""not a million miles away"" from the result of the 2014 independence vote, ""holding a second independence referendum any time soon would represent a very significant gamble as far as Nicola Sturgeon is concerned."" The Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems have all spoken out against a second independence vote, while the Greens are in favour of one. 'Blind faith' On Thursday, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale told Good Morning Scotland that the UK is more important to Scotland than the EU, saying Ms Sturgeon had failed to produce ""real evidence"" of how Scotland could stay in the single market if the UK as a whole leaves. She said she had worked with the first minister in good faith about protecting Scotland's place in Europe, but said ""good faith is fast becoming blind faith"". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said Ms Sturgeon had spent ""six months trying desperately to use Brexit as a way of increasing support for independence"", adding that ""she's failed"". She said: ""Scotland is kept in limbo as Nicola Sturgeon tries to find an escape route after marching her troops to the top of a mountain, but still keeping the threat of a second referendum on the table as a possibility for the future. ""The first minister should act in the interests of the whole country by recognising the decision Scotland made just two years ago and respecting that result. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon was ""in danger of inflicting considerable and damaging economic uncertainty on Scotland"". He said: ""Nicola Sturgeon should now rule out another independence referendum to end this damaging uncertainty. ""You would think that with all the problems with a slipping educational performance, a shortage of GPs and struggling mental health services that the SNP would get on with finding solutions. But the SNP are obsessed with independence so those issues will never be their top priority."" And Ross Greer of the Scottish Green Party has said rights for Scots could only be secured if Scotland was an ""independent nation with the European Union"".",Nicola Sturgeon has suggested a soft Brexit would see the prospect of Scottish independence removed - in the short term.
"The market moved to a Â£7m home at Stretton Sugwas, on the outskirts of the city centre, to make way for the Â£90m regeneration around Edgar Street. Richard Hyde, director of Hereford Market Auctioneers, which has run both sites, said sales were up and the new market was attracting more visitors. At about 16 acres, the custom-built site was more than double the size and much more accessible, he said. ""We've brought people back who haven't been to Hereford for 20 years because of the congestion and parking and difficulty getting in and out,"" he said. ""There are new people virtually every week."" 'Nearly perfect' Mr Hyde said there had a ""phenomenal"" increase in the number of cows sold through the market, with 2012 so far seeing a 59% increase. Meanwhile, the number of sheep sales was up about 22%. He said this time of year was particularly busy for lamb sales. ""At the moment, lamb numbers through this market are in the top three in the country,"" he said. Mr Hyde said the site along the Roman Road, which can accommodate about 240,000 animals a year and is set to expand, suited the future of farming. ""Food production is massively important,"" he said. ""The new site is an absolute godsend. It is what state-of the-art marketing in the 21st Century should be - ease of access, ease of parking. It's customer friendly and it's animal friendly. It is very nearly perfect."" He said in contrast, the city centre site ""was a nightmare on busy days"". The departure of the market from the city centre was met with criticism, particularly by some residents who said a slice of history would be lost as well as the market's distinctive atmosphere. The cost of the move, which was funded by Conservative-run Herefordshire Council, was also criticised. Mark Hubbard, leads the nine It's Our County councillors who had raised objections over the scheme. 'Modern facilities' He said the group was not against the move itself but had ""asked questions"" over the costs being borne by taxpayers. ""I'm very glad that it's doing well, because that is what Herefordshire is about,"" he said. However, Mr Hubbard said you had to consider how much the old site could have been improved with a Â£7m upgrade. In addition, the party is opposed to the Â£90m retail development on the old cattle market site, which he said would ""absolutely"" damage the ""traditional market town centre"" and its shops. ""Also it's the idea of such a retail development being built during a recession when everywhere else is contracting its retail offer,"" he said. Meanwhile, Elwyn Maddy, a beef and sheep farmer from Michaelchurch Escley, said there had been fears the market could have been lost for good. ""There had been a lot of opposition about spending that sort of money but it's important for the farming and rural community and it's success answers criticism that we did not need it."" A farmer for 40 years who sits on the NFU's West Midlands Livestock Board, Mr Maddy added feedback from other farmers had generally been ""very positive"". ""Without a doubt it's a success story,"" he said. You're getting livestock from a very large area. The layout is good, the amenities are good, it's all positive."" David Morgan, a livestock farmer from Peterchurch, added: ""It's a big step forward. ""It brings modern facilities for a modern industry.""","Hereford Livestock Market's controversial move to a new site after more than 150 years in the city centre has been hailed a ""success story"" a year on."
"Swansea council said studies show the clockwise movement of traffic around the bridges could dramatically reduce queues on a main gateway to the city. The work would form part of its multi-million pound boulevard project to improve the city. The council said it would seek the views of the public before proceeding. Cabinet members are being asked to approve a more detailed studied. Officers say a number of options have been examined and the most effective seemed to be a clockwise movement of traffic around the bridges with a two-way flow remaining across the southern bridge closest to the Sainsbury's supermarket. Research suggests that if nothing is done by 2020 peak time congestion would increase by 16% in the morning and 24% in the afternoon. Peak time The council said the same studies showed the changes could lead to a 48% reduction in morning peak time congestion and a 9% reduction in the afternoon. Strengthening the bridges would also be part of the work which would not start until at least late spring 2011. Council leader Chris Holley said: ""Anyone who drives in and out of Swansea city centre along Quay Parade is familiar with the bottlenecks that can build up at the river bridges and how frustrating the traffic tailbacks can be. ""It's crucial we act to tackle this congestion because our research shows the problem will only get worse over the next 10 years if we do nothing."" Subject to cabinet approval, the next step would see the completion of detailed design work and then public consultation.",The two road bridges crossing Swansea's River Tawe close to the city centre may be effectively turned into separate one way systems in a bid to cut congestion.
"The planning committee approved Phase One of the Rochdale Riverside scheme for a complex of new shops and a cinema in the east of the town centre. The development features new Marks and Spencer and Next stores with Reel Cinemas operating the cinema. Developer Genr8 said it would be the ""final element"" of the town's regeneration. The scheme will have about 24 shops and restaurants. Council leader Richard Farnell (Labour) said: ""This is yet more progress for this important development, which will bring High Street names that are not currently represented in Rochdale, as well as thriving restaurants and a cinema, which will create a fantastic destination for our residents and visitors. ""It will also boost our local economy by more than Â£17m and create around 1,000 jobs."" 'Wider regeneration' Gary Davies, of the Rochdale Development Agency, said the approval showed Rochdale was bucking the national trend of town centre decline. ""This decision is part of a wider regeneration which also includes the way the council has encouraged new retail outlets with discounted business rates - at present 17 out of 20 retail units are occupied in the town centre,"" he said. Mike Smith, Partner at Genr8 Developments, said: ""We recognise that this scheme will play a significant role in the regeneration of Rochdale and it is therefore imperative that we attract the right mix of occupiers to boost the local economy and establish Rochdale as a key leisure and retail destination."" Councillors also approved outline plans for the scheme's second phase, which will see a further investment into the town centre, with potential for new offices, a hotel, apartments and commercial uses. The communities secretary will give the final decision. Work could start on the site in Smith Street in the autumn.",A plan for a Â£60m retail development in Rochdale town centre has been backed by councillors.
"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter But with just a few days until the UK's departure, he opened up a little, in an interview with me, about what happened, and what might unfold next. The Taoiseach suggested that the EU will have the upper hand in the upcoming trade negotiations, saying: ""We have a population and a market of 450 million people, the UK it's about 60, so if these were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team?"" He also warned against any UK attempt to get a ""piecemeal"" deal with the EU, saying: ""When I hear people talk about piecemeal, it sounds a bit like cake and eat it,"" and added ""That isn't something that will fly in Europe."" But when I asked him if Ireland had been too stubborn in the last couple of years, he suggested that it was the UK had misread the first phase of Brexit, suggesting that many people in Westminster and Britain ""don't understand Ireland"". He said there was an imagined scenario that France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the small countries what's what. But he said: ""That's not the way the 21st Century works. That's certainly not the way the EU works"". Echoing other leaders, Mr Varadkar also questioned the the timetable set by Boris Johnson to get a trade deal with the rest of the EU by the end of the year. He disagreed with the Prime Minister's claim that there is ""bags of time"", saying: ""It will be difficult to do this,"" and suggesting that there might have to be an extension to the next part of the Brexit process, beyond the end of this year, to finalise a trade deal. He did however pledge to work ""night and day"" to try and get it done and said: ""We won't be dragging our feet"". The Taoiseach said to get a deal there would have to be legal assurances that the UK would not undercut the EU, agreeing a ""common set of minimum standards"", that would have to be ""high standards"". There is no question it's going to be a key area of contention in the coming months, saying that he did trust Boris Johnson, but that it was in ""black and white"" that were would have to be some checks on goods going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, despite Boris Johnson's repeated insistence that there will not have to be. Looking back, Mr Varadkar said he had been genuinely afraid that the UK might have left the EU without a deal, but that a meeting between the two men on the Wirral in the autumn had provided the ""crucial moment"". He said the progress at the summit was the ""simple story"" of ""two guys in a roomâ¦ talking turkey"" without their staff present, where they found a way that they could move forward. ""I knew when I was leaving Liverpool Airport that things were looking promising again,"" he said. Michel Barnier will visit the Irish leader again today, another statement of intent about how Ireland's position will be taken into consideration by the EU at large, a situation that the government here in Dublin has no wish to leave behind.","For a long time, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has sidestepped talking at length about his role in the fraught political journey of Brexit in the last few years."
"Meanwhile, NHS Wales figures show patient numbers in hospital with coronavirus is the highest since April.

""They need some air to breathe, they need some space to move."" Mr O'Neill welcomed the reopening of pubs and restaurants but added: ""It needs to be managed with effective measures with both police and community safety working very closely together to monitor that."" The case rate - from figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) and the UK's other public health bodies - takes into account the size of local populations and measures the rate after nearly all the test results have been processed. The most reliable comparative figures for the whole of the UK, for the seven days up to 1 November, saw Merthyr moving ahead of a number of areas in north west England. Others included Salford, Rochdale and Bury. PHW published updated figures later on Thursday showing Merthyr's case rate was slightly lower on 719.4 per 100,000 people. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) had risen to 556.7. It had been ranked ninth in the UK. Blaenau Gwent - tenth hardest hit in the UK - now has 509.6 cases per 100,000, with Sirhowy still having the highest local case rate in Wales, currently 1,088 per 100,000 - involving 77 cases in the last seven days. Gelllideg, Cefn Coed-y-Cymmer, Heolgerrig and Park districts have the highest local case rates in Merthyr, followed by Gurnos, as shown by a breakdown of local data from PHW. NHS Wales figures meanwhile show the number of Covid patients in hospital on 3 November was 1,344 across Wales, the highest number since 25 April. This is 21% up on the week before. Covid patients account for 17% of all those in hospital beds. They will include more than 200 cases of infections acquired inside hospitals, in the last week. The figures also show:","Merthyr Tydfil now has the worst case rate for Covid-19 in the UK, with two other south Wales valleys areas also among the hardest-hit, figures show."

In May, the shed - driven and built by Kevin Nicks - managed 101.046mph (162.617kph) on the same sands. The record at Sunday's Straightliners event came three months after the shed's engine exploded during a race. Mr Nicks, 54, from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, said: ""It's a good result. I had to start all over again when its engine blew up, and then had three months solid of mechanical problems. ""Because I've had so many issues I didn't want to absolutely cane it. I went a bit steadier because I was afraid it would blow up again. ""But despite that I've managed to set a new record, and I'm absolutely delighted.""

"By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC Radio 4 Today Sir Oliver Letwin, former head of the government's Brexit preparations, and two former law officers said the case should not go to the Supreme Court. Instead, they want ministers to bring a bill to Parliament to start the process of Brexit as soon as possible. The government said it would robustly defend its position at the appeal. The MPs voiced their concerns after the Supreme Court decided on Friday that the Scottish and Welsh governments should have a say at the appeal hearing in December. Former minister Sir Oliver, who oversaw a ""Brexit Unit"" in the Cabinet Office after the referendum, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that the Supreme Court hearing could see ministers' powers outside Parliament curbed. He added that one of the advantages of bringing a ""fast and tightly timetabled and constrained bill"" to Parliament, giving the government the ability to trigger Brexit without any constraints on its negotiating power, was that it avoided ""any risk of the Supreme Court deciding to accord the devolved administrations some rights or even some veto powers"" over triggering Article 50. Former Solicitor General Sir Edward Garnier said Mrs May should drop the appeal to avoid expense and a row about judges' powers, while former Attorney General Dominic Grieve said he could not see the point of continuing with the case. All three said ministers should bring a bill allowing the government to begin leaving the European Union - triggering Article 50 - as soon as possible. Legal questions at the heart of the Article 50 ruling All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Sir Edward said: ""That way you avoid an unnecessary legal row, you avoid a lot of unnecessary expense, but you also avoid an opportunity for ill-motivated people to attack the judiciary, to misconstrue the motives of both parties to the lawsuit, and you provide certainty."" Mr Grieve said: ""I can't see the point in the government continuing with the case and also agree that if they enact primary legislation, they will get it through Parliament. ""I think their chances of success in court are low."" The three MPs all backed the Remain campaign at the June referendum. They all now support triggering Article 50 before the end of March - the deadline set out by the prime minister. Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who was a Leave campaigner, said he believed the government had a ""very strong case"" for its appeal. ""The problem with getting into any saga with courts is you can't predict the outcome,"" he said, adding that uncertainty over Brexit was damaging for the economy. ""My concern is that we deliver on what the people wanted.... There was this huge vote to leave, it has to be delivered. If it is not delivered there will be the most shattering damage to the integrity of the establishment."" 'On track' A government spokesman said: ""The country voted to leave the European Union in a referendum approved by an Act of Parliament and the government is determined to respect that result. ""We will robustly defend our position in the forthcoming appeal. As the prime minister made clear [on Friday], our work is on track and we remain committed to triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year."" The High Court ruled in early November that Parliament must vote on whether Article 50 could be invoked. A final judgement from the Supreme Court is not expected until January.","Theresa May should abandon an appeal against the court ruling that means MPs must vote on the UK leaving the EU, leading Conservatives say."
"Scottish Police Federation (SPF) chairman David Hamilton said the police could otherwise be ""super spreaders"". He argued that frontline officers should be seen as part of the frontline effort to control the disease. The Scottish government said it wanted to support key workers to get back to work, with police officers included in the priority group for testing. Mr Hamilton said: ""At the moment people are returning to work and continuing to work potentially spreading the virus amongst the colleagues and amongst the public and that is something that can't be acceptable from a public health perspective."" Failure to introduce asymptomatic testing creates a ""back door"" for the virus from a public health perspective, he said. Mr Hamilton added that police officers were ""almost like super spreaders"" if they are not tested. The SPF has been calling for asymptomatic testing for a number of weeks, as officers encounter situations when they are not wearing PPE. Spitting attacks He also raised concerns about attacks on his members which deliberately attempt to infect them. ""Not only is it disgusting, coughing and spitting on someone, particularly at this time, it is absolutely appalling and essentially weaponsing the virus and using it to try and cause harm to other individuals,"" he said. Mr Hamilton believes after a ""slow start"" the Crown Office has responded to calls for a tougher approach to offenders. He added: ""What we want the public to know is that this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour. ""People need to know that this will not be tolerated by society. ""This is an attack on police officers but also on society in general because, as police officers, we move throughout society and we could be unwittingly transmitting the virus to others because of these types of attacks (coughing and spitting) so it needs to be absolutely stamped out at the earliest stage."" Mr Hamilton said he would expect any offenders to appear from custody and be given a ""heavy sentence"". A spokesman for the Scottish government said threats to police officers and front-line workers would ""not be tolerated"". He added: ""The Lord Advocate has underlined that prosecutors will respond robustly to criminal conduct related to coronavirus."" On testing, he said the government's approach was to ""protect the most vulnerable"". ""As part of this, we want to help support key workers to get back to work. That's why symptomatic police officers, or members of their household, are included in the priority group for testing.""",Representatives of Scotland's police officers have called for them to have routine testing for coronavirus.

Thousands of tonnes of rock, soil and trees first slipped down the hillside behind the houses on Cyfyng Road in 2012, before further landslides caused some gardens to drop away. Morrison admitted continuing to carry out structural work on his property without the council's permission. Prosecutor Ian Ibrahim said residents of the other 10 terraced homes issued with the prohibition order had now left but Morrison had been spotted by council workers at his property on two separate occasions last summer. Morrison said he believed the council had wanted him to carry out work to help secure the property against further landslips. He said: ""The house is in exactly the same structural place as it always has been for 150 years. ""That's why we didn't think we'd have to ask for permission.""

"Simon Wright and Anna Thorpe dressed in a top hat and veil for the Parkrun at Catton Park in Norwich on Saturday, before going on to the ceremony. The couple, who met through their running club and got engaged while on a run, wanted their Parkrun community ""to be part of our special day"". ""Parkrun is our Saturday tradition and we are addicted to it,"" said Mr Wright. Parkrun is a free timed 5km race run by volunteers at thousands of locations across the world every Saturday morning. Mr Wright, 39, and Miss Thorpe, 32, felt running had to feature in their wedding day - but changed into other outfits for the ceremony. ""Running has been an important part of both our lives,"" said Mr Wright, who is the former Liberal Democrat MP for Norwich South. ""We have had some difficult experiences and we both looked to running as a new activity."" The couple met two years ago at the Norwich Road Runners' Christmas fancy dress run. ""I was there as Santa, and Anna was there as an elf, and we got chatting,"" he said. They got engaged during a night-time run round Whitlingham Broad in October, when Mr Wright stopped to pop the question by the light of a head torch. Saturday's Parkrun was Miss Thorpe's 70th and Mr Wright's 134th, but they were joined by dozens of friends completing their first. They were then due to get married at St Matthew's Church in Thorpe Hamlet. ""It's wonderful what people have done,"" said Miss Thorpe. ""It's surpassed all our expectations."" The couple said they were happy to contravene wedding etiquette by seeing each other on the morning of their nuptials. ""For us, Parkrun is bigger - it's a more meaningful tradition,"" said Mr Wright.",A bride and groom-to-be have been joined by 100 friends on a 5km (3.1m) run on the morning of their wedding.
"Katie Crowder deliberately hurt 19-month-old Gracie at their home in Mansfield in March and delayed getting help, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Prosecutors said Gracie suffered burns that covered 65% of her body and was left for at least an hour. Her severe injuries could not have been caused accidentally, they added. Crowder, 26, of Wharmby Avenue, denied murdering Gracie on 6 March but was found guilty earlier this month following a trial. She was ordered to serve at least 21 years in prison on Wednesday. 'Pain and distress' Judge Jeremy Baker, sentencing, said Crowder had poured ""a significant quantity of scalding water on Gracie's face and body"". ""This would have caused Gracie intense pain which would have led her to cry out vigorously, become distressed and seek to physically escape from the source of the heat,"" he said. ""Her death would not have occurred swiftly and she would have continued to suffer pain and distress for a significant period of an hour or more."" He added ""for whatever reason"" Crowder did not seek help from her parents, who lived a few doors away, until after Gracie had died. ""Thereafter all attempts to save her life... were rendered futile,"" he said. The jury had heard an ambulance was called after Crowder appeared at her parents' house nearby shortly before 06:30 GMT holding Gracie in her arms, shouting ""she's dead"". Prosecutor Sally Howes QC said the child's injuries were not immediately life-threatening and had she received help sooner, she could have survived. Experts gave evidence to say they believed it would have taken Gracie about an hour to die, and she would have been ""screaming"". The judge also said that morning, Crowder took a ""significant quantity of cocaine"" - although it was not clear whether this was before the scalding or when she should have been ""seeking urgent medical attention"". Crowder told the court she had not heard Gracie and found her lying on the bathroom floor next to a bucket of hot water. She claimed she had filled the bucket to clean up dog urine but then left it in the bathroom to get changed and put a quilt in the washing machine. Det Ch Insp Rob Routledge, from Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""This case really affected the whole team but we now have the consolation of knowing that the harrowing work involved in gathering the evidence has resulted in justice for Gracie.""

"Tracy Houghton, 45, died instantly along with her sons Ethan, 13, and Joshua, 11, and her partner's daughter Aimee Goldsmith, also 11, when Tomasz Kroker smashed into stationary traffic. Judge Maura McGowan said his attention had been so poor he ""might as well have had his eyes closed"". Kroker, 30, was scrolling through music selections at the time of the crash. 'Sudden horror' The court heard he had been so distracted he barely looked at the road for almost a kilometre. The judge described the case as the most horrific she had ever seen. Kate Goldsmith, whose daughter Aimee died in the crash on the A34 near Newbury in Berkshire, said Kroker had turned his lorry into a ""lethal weapon"" by using his phone while driving at 50mph, and she made a plea to all road users to learn the lessons from the case. ""We urge you to make a personal commitment to stop using mobile phones while driving and make our roads safer for everyone,"" she said. Speaking outside Reading Crown Court, she said: ""The 10-year sentence will not ease our pain and suffering, nor do we believe it will send a strong enough message to those who lack the self-restraint to not use a mobile phone when driving."" Lorry death crash: Live updates The court heard how the family had been returning from a camping trip in two cars at the time of the crash on 10 August Ms Houghton's partner Mark Goldsmith and his 13-year-old son Jake were in a car that was struck by Kroker. The court heard how the Vauxhall Zafira being driven by Mr Goldsmith was shunted into the Corsa containing the rest of the family, which was forced underneath a lorry in front. The Corsa was compressed to a third of its normal size, the court was told. Prosecutor Charles Ward-Jackson said: ""It is a particularly distressing feature that the two surviving members of the family were in the car behind, and a 13-year-old boy was forced to witness at close range the deaths of four members of close family."" Some family members left the court as the prosecution began to show photos of the crash scene and video from the lorry's cab camera. Others were reduced to tears as video of the crash was shown. Less than a second before the impact, an onboard camera showed Kroker, originally from Poland, ""looking up with sudden horror on his face... it was too late to take any avoiding action"", the court heard. In the pile-up, Kroker also seriously injured Mazda driver Adam Pearson, whose car was thrown on to its roof, leaving him with a collapsed lung and a broken back, and also injured the two occupants of a Citroen. Jake Goldsmith, who witnessed his sister Aimee's death, now suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to a victim impact statement from his mother Kathryn. ""Jake doesn't talk much any more, he doesn't have much to say,"" she said. ""Our nights are plagued with nightmares and broken sleep."" The court heard that an hour before the pile-up, Kroker had signed a declaration to his employer, promising he would not use his phone at the wheel. He initially told police his brakes failed, and the traffic in front of him ""just stopped"". He was also found to have lied to his bosses about whether he had been distracted, claiming he had the radio on. The lorry driver, from Trajan Walk, Andover, Hampshire, pleaded guilty on 10 October to four counts of causing death by dangerous driving.",A lorry driver who killed a mother and three children while distracted by his phone has been jailed for 10 years.
"By Tamsin MelvilleBBC Cornwall political reporter Routine water testing found levels of E.coli were above those permitted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The Mission said it was supporting four families and 20 others had problems. Fishing, food and water agencies said they were working to try and improve the water quality in the longer term. 'Next day, nothing' Restrictions have been in place since the end of April after testing found high E.coli levels. The deterioration in water quality has been blamed on two very wet winters which led to more run-off from farmland and increased sewage overflows. Timmy Heard, who has fished for mussels for 20 years said he had help from the charity because ""things are as tough as they can get"". He said: ""We're earning nothing, but I can't give up. I've put too long into it to give up."" Keith Dickson, from the Mission - which is the only charity dedicated to helping fishermen, said: ""They've been told they can't catch, and that's income gone in the blink of an eye. It's putting a huge financial burden on families. ""One day you're fishing quite happily. The next day, nothing."" Cornwall Council's port health manager for Falmouth Docks, Gary Cooper, said he was hopeful the fishery would be considered for an upgrade in status within eight weeks. The FSA, Environment Agency and South West Water said they were working together and with the council to minimise pollution and to try and improve water quality in the longer-term. More investment in sewage systems, increased water sampling and improvements to slurry storage on farms were all under way, they said.","Mussel fishermen in Cornwall are having to rely on charity because pollution in the Fal Estuary has led to a ban on harvesting the shellfish, according to the Fishermen's Mission."
"Incentive payments will be paid where ""preventable admissions"" are reduced, or different trusts work together well, or patient services are improved.

Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) hopes to roll out the pilot from April next year. It said its health and social care system ""must change"" and ""incentive payments"" would encourage innovative ways of working. Health problems such as diabetes, chronic heart and lung disease and cancer are the main focus of the new way of funding, which the group has called ""outcomes-based commissioning"". The group estimated that 4% of Somerset's population living with long-term health problems - about 25,000 people - ""make use of some 50% of the Somerset CCG's Â£750m annual budget"".

Mr Field told the operator Mr Farquhar had fallen and struck his head. Mr Field denies murder, conspiracy to murder, possessing an article for the use in fraud and an alternative charge of attempted murder. He has admitted four charges of fraud and two of burglary. In a call to the NHS in September 2015, which was played to the court, Mr Field told the call handler: ""He falls frequently because, err, you know something that's yet undiagnosed but it, it's probably a dementia.""

To make the pair think they were losing their minds he laced Mr Farquhar's food and drink with drugs and neat alcohol, jurors heard. The court also heard Mr Field wrote religious messages on Ms Moore-Martin's mirrors which she believed were messages from God. Mr Field is charged alongside Martyn Smith, 32, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, who denies murder, conspiracy to murder, two charges of fraud and one of burglary.

"Horizon, the company behind the massive project near Cemaes, Anglesey, has carried out a second public consultation which closes on Tuesday. The company said the project will bring significant investment to the island. Geoff Lang, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board's strategy director, said services could be squeezed. He said, with the addition of workers and their family members, the population of Anglesey could rise by about 12% and the impact may fall on a small number of GP practices. Horizon estimates Wylfa Newydd will take about nine years to build with between 8,000 and 11,000 workers during the construction phase. ""Working on an average GP list size ratio of one GP to 1,800 patients, it is estimated that there could be a requirement for an additional 4.5 GPs, with associated clinical and support staff to meet the potential needs of the workers,"" he said. This would also impact on hospital and community services such as mental health, substance misuse, dental, children and maternity, he said. The health board's budget funding formula does not take into account such a major development, so extra money is being sought, Mr Lang added. He said despite, the challenges, there are potential benefits in terms of investment and a legacy for the community.","The planned Wylfa Newydd nuclear power station will present ""significant challenges"" to services in north Wales, the health board has said."
"By Mario Cacciottolo & Natasa SimovicBBC News Leslie Binns, 42, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, turned around to save Sunita Hazra, an Indian woman, who was scaling the summit ahead of him. He said he felt ""immensely proud"" to have saved a life but wished he could have also helped save another climber, who died on the descent. Mr Binns was blinded in his left eye after an explosion in Afghanistan. He was in the Army for 13 years, serving in Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan and was blown up four times. He has been awarded two medals, including the Queen's Commendation for Bravery for finding improvised explosive devices in Afghanistan in 2009. Ms Hazra, who is 32 and lives near Kolkata in India, left hospital on Wednesday. Her brother Kingshuk Chatterjee told the BBC the family ""cannot express our gratitude"" to Mr Binns for saving her. ""He's the reason why she is still alive now,"" he said. ""He is a very brave man."" Mr Binns, who now works in private security in oil fields in Iraq, said the incident happened when he was on a climb in the early hours of 21 May. He was approaching an area nicknamed ""The Balcony"" - where climbing teams store spare oxygen bottles - when he noticed a ""commotion"" ahead of him. ""I noticed someone sliding down the fixed climbing lines towards me. ""All I could hear were the screams of terror as the person gained momentum. I braced myself to try and stop whoever it was, and managed to do so. ""At this time I didn't know that this was Sunita Hazra. I helped her upright and looked at her oxygen regulator. It was registering empty."" Mr Binns helped Ms Hazra recover and she attempted to continue her descent by herself, but collapsed after about 20 metres. ""It was at this point I decided to cancel my summit bid to help Sunita,"" Mr Binns said. He was about another 12 hours away from making the final ascent to the top. ""I climbed down to her and called my Sherpa. I told him we are not going up and we would give Sunita my spare oxygen bottle and take her down."" He says the descent was a perilous and difficult one, and on the way the three climbers found another man who was also struggling to descend, bringing him along with them. Mr Binns said Ms Hazra and the other climber ""kept collapsing"", adding: ""I fell into waist-deep crevasses no less than five times, which was very tiring, and we were also crossing blue ice which was very dangerous as we kept slipping."" Eventually he and Ms Hazra managed to reach his camp, but due to exhaustion and difficult weather conditions they were unable to bring the other climber along. ""I gave Sunita my sleeping bag in my tent. We then tried our best to get her warm by patting and rubbing her. She was suffering from hypothermia and her right hand was badly frost-bitten. ""I then remembered we had a flask of ginger tea. I used this to try and re-warm Sunita's hand. I dried it off and told her to keep it in her fleece pocket which would keep it warm."" Mr Binns says that while in his tent he heard the other climber's voice in the distance ""but I was too exhausted to go back out - I literally collapsed and fell asleep"". In the morning, Mr Binns learned the other climber had been found and taken to his team. Ms Hazra's Sherpa came to collect her and help her to continue down the mountain. But when Mr Binns continued with his own descent that next day, he came across the body of the other climber, who had died during his journey downwards. Mr Binns believes Sherpas took the body down from the mountain, and is unsure as to how the climber eventually died. Mr Binns said: ""I truly regret not being able to do anything more for him. But I had nothing left in me that night and I tried my level best to rescue him, but he could not be moved. No summit is worth a life. ""I am immensely proud that I helped Sunita. I just wish I could have done more."" Mr Binns, who has climbed ""all the major peaks in the UK"", is now in Kathmandu and due to return to the UK to see his fiancee and daughter on 6 June. ""I wish Sunita and her family all the best and hope she makes a full recovery,"" he said.

"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son is the first member of the UK Royal family to have his first birthday marked by a new coin. The third in line to the throne and future king turns one on 22 July. The design of the sterling silver piece was approved by his parents; his great-grandmother the Queen; and Chancellor George Osborne. It bears the heraldic royal arms and the year 2014. Prince George was photographed at the weekend walking with the help of his mother. Shane Bissett, director of commemorative coin and bullion at the Royal Mint, said: ""We felt there could be no more fitting design to mark the first birthday of our future king than the royal arms - the arms of the monarch - minted in honour of the future heir to the throne. ""The choice of a silver coin is significant too, as the precious metal is closely associated with newborn babies... ""Crossing the palm of a newborn baby with silver is a way to wish them wealth and good health throughout their life, whilst the Â£5 coin is a favourite for royal celebrations."" The coins will be a limited mintage of 7,500 and will cost Â£80 each from the Royal Mint. The heraldic royal arms incorporates the four quarterings of the royal arms, each contained in a shield, as well as a rose, thistle, leek, a sprig of shamrock and a crown. It was originally created for the Queen and was last used on a coin struck for the British Exhibition in New York in 1960.

"The plea has come from former home secretary David Blunkett. An investigation by Labour's ruling NEC found ""sufficient evidence of concern"" about membership lists in the Falkirk constituency party. The probe followed claims the Unite union sought to ""stitch up"" the candidate selection process. The union has denied any wrongdoing and has demanded access to the internal document. The row centres on allegations that Unite encouraged its members to join the constituency Labour Party in order to provide support to a favoured union candidate. Speaking on the Daily Politics on BBC Two, Mr Blunkett said the party had ""taken the right step by having an investigation"" and said he hoped the NEC would ""deal with it decisively"". Mr Blunkett went on to say he thought the party should publish the report, adding that Labour ""should be as transparent as possible"". However, Labour said its standard practice was not to publish the NEC's internal reports. Last week the party took control of the process of selecting a replacement for Falkirk MP Eric Joyce - who is stepping down at the next election. It is choosing its candidate from an all-woman shortlist and no-one who joined Labour after 12 March 2012 - the day when Mr Joyce announced he was standing down - will be able to take part in the process. In a statement, Unite accused the Labour leadership of ""the mass disenfranchisement of Unite members and other decent men and women in Falkirk"". It went on to say that it believed the matter had now escalated into a ""a political issue over the future of the Labour Party"". Unite also rejected claims of vote rigging and said it had operated ""entirely within the rules and procedures of the Labour Party.""",Labour has been urged to publish an internal report which led the party to take over the selection process to find a new Falkirk constituency candidate.
"It comes after CCTV footage issued last month showed thieves in Solihull using a device - that tricks a car into thinking the key is present - to steal a Mercedes in less than a minute. West Midlands Police said equipment, not thought to be used in the theft, was recovered from a car. The seizure led to Martynas Auga, from Merseyside, being jailed on Monday. Birmingham Crown Court heard officers began pursuing Auga's Peugeot on Landor Street in the city centre in the early hours of 2 November, but had to give up for safety reasons. They subsequently found it abandoned nearby and discovered the relay equipment, along with two sets of number plates, two mobile phones and a bag of tools inside, the force said. PC Mitch Darby, who was involved in pursuing Auga's Peugeot, said: ""This is certainly the first relay device recovered in the Midlands and I'm not aware of any others recovered nationally."" Auga was jailed for 18 months after admitting going equipped to steal, dangerous driving, driving without a licence and failing to stop. The 32-year-old from Sefton Street, Southport, was also banned from driving for 18 months. Auga declined to answer police questions about whether he was involved in the keyless theft of cars, police said. In the CCTV footage of the Solihull theft, one of the men can be seen waving a box in front of the victim's house. The device receives a signal from the key inside and transmits it to the second box next to the car. The car's systems are then tricked into thinking the key is present and it unlocks, before the ignition can be started. Drivers are advised to use a Thatcham-approved steering lock to cover the entire steering wheel or put keys inside an RFID signal blocking bag, which stop the signals from the key being transmitted.","Police have seized car theft ""relay"" devices in what they believe is a first for a UK force."
"The sale has been planned for more than a year but was held up after the Indian government imposed costly conditions on the deal. Ministers in Delhi wanted a change to the payment of royalties on oil recovered from the country. More than 97% of shareholders voted to accept the conditions. Earlier this year, cabinet ministers in Delhi decided to change the terms under which Cairn Energy was encouraged to explore for oil in the Rajasthani desert. That deal was struck before any oil was found, when Indian authorities were keen to make it attractive for foreign companies to drill for oil. The original terms forced ONGC, the majority state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, to pay all the royalties on any oil extracted from Cairn India's massive Mangala oil field in Rajasthan. The ONGC has been pushing to reduce its liability and now the Indian government has decided to make the cost of those royalties recoverable - meaning profit can only be taken by shareholders such as Cairn Energy or Vedanta once the royalty payments have been accounted for. Edinburgh-based Cairn currently owns 52% of its spin-off partner Cairn India, while Vedanta owns 28%. The Scottish group plans to sell a total of 40% of its Cairn India stake to Vedanta in a two-stage deal worth nearly $6bn. The first tranche of 10% was sold in July and realised $1.4bn, while the sale of the second tranche of 30% remains to be completed. That sale was approved by the Government of India in June, subject to certain conditions, and is expected to realise about $4bn.

"Muslim convert Safiyya Shaikh went on a reconnaissance trip to scope out the London landmark and a hotel. The 36-year-old, born Michelle Ramsden, was arrested after asking an undercover police officer to supply bombs. At the Old Bailey, Shaikh, of west London, admitted preparing an act of terrorism and will be sentenced in May. She was considered such a threat that MI5 made her the highest-level priority for investigation in the weeks before her arrest, according to Whitehall security sources. It meant she was subject to a level of surveillance reserved for only the most dangerous potential attackers. Over the two months before her arrest in October 2019, Shaikh built up a relationship with two undercover officers who were posing as a husband and wife extremist team. She messaged one of them via an encrypted social media app. 'Bomb under the dome' ""I want to kill a lot,"" she told the officer. ""I would like to do church... a day like Christmas or Easter good, kill more. ""I always send threats. But I want to make threats real."" She sent a picture of St Paul's Cathedral to the officer and wrote: ""I would like to do this place for sure. ""I would like bomb and shoot 'til death... I really would love to destroy that place and the kaffir there."" Analysis By Dominic Casciani, Home Affairs correspondent Shaikh was caught thanks to a combination of critical pieces of the picture of her extremism that came together over time. First, there was mounting intelligence of her extremist ideology. She stopped going to a mosque because she suspected she would be reported for her views. Second, a cyber operation revealed she headed a significant pro-IS social media chat platform that was pumping out propaganda and urging attacks on targets in Europe. Dutch counter-terrorism investigators linked that account to numerous threats in The Netherlands, one of which had led to the evacuation of a church. Two undercover operations swung into action. In the first, she was befriended by an ""online role player"" - an officer posing as a fellow extremist to gain more insight into her intentions. These operations have become increasingly important in fighting terrorism as officers track extremists in social media and work out which ones will convert their talk into attacks. Once Shaikh's intentions were confirmed, a real-world undercover operation had to prove how dangerous she was in the meeting where she explicitly asked for bombs. Just over a week later Shaikh, of Hayes, visited St Paul's and sent videos to her contact, writing: ""I will to the bomb under the dome. ""I will also do something in hotel, then church, then kill 'til I'm dead."" Prosecutors say she gave two bags which she wanted to be fitted with homemade bombs to the female undercover officer. Shaikh converted to Islam in 2007 after being impressed by the kindness of her Muslim neighbours but later became isolated and apparently rejected mainstream Islam. She began to court the extremist violent ideology of IS and other jihadist groups and by 2016 Shaikh stopped attending mosques. She was also reported to the government's Prevent programme. In a police interview Shaikh admitted posting extremist material and plotting a bomb attack, although she said she might not have gone through with it. In court she pleaded guilty to the preparation of terrorist acts and dissemination of terrorist publications. Mr Justice Sweeney ordered reports ahead of sentencing on 11 May. In November, Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said the UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter-terrorism investigations. He said 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017.",A supporter of the banned Islamic State terror group has admitted plotting to blow herself up in a bomb attack on St Paul's Cathedral.
"Tony RoePolitical editor, BBC East Midlands After a weekend when the infighting was at its height, there was - by Monday - an acceptance that making Â£4bn of savings on disability payments was the wrong thing to do. But the next day, the former Tory chancellor, Ken Clarke, said the government would be wise to leave open the possibility of more welfare cuts, if it's to successfully tackle the fiscal deficit. It set the Rushcliffe MP trending on Twitter. The veteran MP is concerned too much in the budget has been ringfenced and protected. In a way, that was Iain Duncan Smith's argument against his own government when he resigned. The now former work and pensions secretary made a passionate case on the Andrew Marr show when he said: ""We need to make sure we widen the scope of where we look to get the deficit down and not just narrow it down on working age benefits."" He also said of the prime minister: ""He has done a very good job, but I believe they're losing sight of the direction of the travel"". When the chancellor sat down after delivering the budget ""for the next generation"" to roars of approval behind him, it all unravelled rather rapidly, leading to the next generation of work and pensions secretary. The Independent Institute for Fiscal Studies produced a graph showing the biggest losers in the budget were the poorest families. The winners are wealthy pensioners. Mr Clarke probably falls into that category. He told me: ""The strains of the EU referendum are proving very considerable for the Conservative party."" But he was persuaded the Duncan Smith resignation was no eurosceptic plot. ""He has had difficulty because so much of the constraints came on his budget. But spending on the disabled is going up. It exceeds the budget for the entire Ministry of Defence and is rising rapidly because they've made a mistake in how they calculate the PIPs (Personal Independence payments)."" Another Conservative MP told me there was concern the row would give the party the label of the ""nasty party"" again, which was to be avoided at all costs. Concern was also expressed about the way George Osborne was running the Treasury. The phrase ""for short term political gain"" was used. ""He has been trying to control everything through budgets just like Gordon Brown did - education, local government, health, welfare. He has polarised the party between FOGs (Friends of George) and the rest,"" I was told. But will what has happened after the budget, which incidentally has been left with a Â£4bn black hole, damage George Osborne's leadership ambitions? ""I haven't the first idea,"" said Mr Clarke."" In my experience, the leadership of the Conservative Party has always been won by a candidate whom nobody had thought of until three weeks before. ""At the moment, the media just report every political event as is it good for Boris bad for Boris? Good for George bad for George? When David Cameron finally steps down, I don't think what's happened this week will have anything to do with the outcome."" And what of the opposition ? There was concern expressed among Labour ranks that an opportunity to use Iain Duncan Smith's own arguments about unfairness was missed by Jeremy Corbyn when up against the prime minister on Monday. He didn't mention the former cabinet minister and concentrated his fire on wondering why the chancellor had not appeared in the Commons and demanding his resignation. It was left to Liz Kendall, Labour MP for Leicester West, to ask David Cameron: ""The prime minister says he is a compassionate Conservative leading a one nation government - so how does he feel when a former leader of his party and a member of his cabinet for six years says this simply is not true?"" The prime minister replied saying four million people had been lifted out of income tax, there had been an increase in disability benefit and 2.4 million more people had a job. But he was ""sad"" Iain Duncan Smith had left the government.",There's one thing all Conservatives have agreed on this week - Iain Duncan Smith had turned the welfare system around and was doing a great job before resigning.
"They were created by artist Charles Ricketts for the literary couple Katherine Bradley and Edith Cooper. The pair had a personal as well as literary relationship and wrote under the pen-name Michael Field, until the truth behind the name was uncovered. The pieces are part of a collection owned by the Fitzwilliam Museum. The museum will exhibit 70 items of jewellery and metalwork, many on display for the first time and much of it previously undocumented. Katherine Bradley was Edith Cooper's aunt and the pair wrote poetry and plays. Museum research assistant Helen Ritchie said their relationship ""broke the rules dictated by 19th Century society"" and they ""enjoyed a long and devoted romantic relationship"". The discovery that Michael Field was in fact two women ""undoubtedly affected their commercial success"", she said. In 1894 they met Ricketts, whose partner was the artist Charles Shannon, and the couples became friends. Only some of the pieces created for the women have survived and the jewels exhibited were bequeathed to the Fitzwilliam by Bradley. The objects are a ""previously overlooked"" part of the museum's collection, according to the director of the Royal Collection Tim Knox, who was until recently the Fitzwilliam's director. He said it does not have room to permanently display all its collections and the exhibition will showcase ""extraÂ­ordinary examples of craftsmanship"". Ms Ritchie said they ""tell a story of industrialiÂ­sation and trade, of travel and exploration and the effect of other cultures on British life and design"". The majority were donated by Anne Hull Grundy, who was born in Germany to a Jewish family which emigrated to England in 1933. Ms Ritchie said: ""In many ways... she was the first collector to take jewellery seriously as another avenue of art history.""","Late 19th Century jewellery with ""an iconic place in the history of queer art in Britain"" is going on display at an exhibition in Cambridge."
"The runway was shut twice on Wednesday to clear snow and ice, leading to almost 60 flights being cancelled. Some passengers took to social media to describe the problems, with some saying it was ""chaos"". About 100 passengers remained on Thursday morning, but all have now been dealt with by their airline. In a statement, the airport said things are now ""back to normal"". ""Flights are operating on schedule and any passengers who were unable to return home after their flight was cancelled yesterday have been rebooked on to other flights,"" a spokesman added. Dave Clayton, whose flight from Stansted to Cork was delayed by four and a half hours, said they were not given any information. ""There were these flights getting cancelled, people coming back in, people that were supposed to go all over Europe, but the thing with it was that we were given no information,"" he said. ""We were all just stuck there in the departure lounge, hundreds of people all crammed in and having absolutely no information whatsoever, and no-one from any of the airlines there either."" On Wednesday night, bosses at Stansted said beds and blankets were handed out to those who were unable to return home and free food and drink was also provided. Many passengers posted online, with some describing the situation as ""chaos"". Ryanair said it regretted being forced to cancel a ""small number of flights"" due to ""snow-related runway closures"".

"The jury concluded the 96 fans who died as a result of a crush at the Liverpool v Nottingham FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989 were unlawfully killed. They found that a number of failures including errors from South Yorkshire Police, the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and defects in the stadium contributed to the deaths. What happens next for those involved in the UK's worst sporting disaster? Criminal inquiries Two criminal investigations have been taking place during the Hillsborough inquests. Operation Resolve and the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched inquiries after the publication of the Hillsborough Independent Panel's (HIP) report in 2012. It raised questions about the policing of Hillsborough and presented evidence of a cover-up to shift blame on to Liverpool fans. What are they investigating? Operation Resolve is investigating the causes of the disaster including the events on the day and those leading up to it. It is looking at a range of organisations and bodies involved in the preparation and planning of the match. The IPCC is looking into police actions in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster. It is considering offences including perverting the course of justice, perjury, and misconduct in a public office. What evidence is being reviewed? Operation Resolve's areas of investigation include: It is also examining the actions of South Yorkshire Police, but this is being managed by the IPCC to provide ""oversight and scrutiny"" and ""ensure independence"". On the IPCC's request, Operation Resolve will investigate actions by police relating to: The IPCC has a number of allegations to consider to form the basis of its decisions. They are: What evidence is being looked at? Operation Resolve is re-examining documents and data collected from various sources. They include the original police investigation, the coroner's inquest, a public inquiry, private prosecution, a judicial review and the HIP. The IPCC has so far taken hundreds of statements from police officers. Could criminal prosecutions be brought? Jurors at the Hillsborough inquests concluded the 96 Hillsborough victims were unlawfully killed and there were a number of failings from South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Ambulance Service, Sheffield Wednesday and the stadium's engineers. In reaching a conclusion of unlawful killing, jurors agreed that match commander David Duckenfield (above) was ""responsible for manslaughter by gross negligence"" due to a breach of his duty of care. Inquests are not criminal proceedings and cannot return conclusions such as murder or manslaughter. They are heard in coroners courts and establish the circumstances surrounding a person's death, including how, when and why the death occurred. Therefore a criminal investigation is needed to gather evidence ahead of decisions about whether any person, or organisation, should face criminal prosecution. What does this mean? Operation Resolve, led by former Chief Constable of Durham Police, Jon Stoddart, will determine whether the 96 fans who died as a result of a crush were unlawfully killed in the Hillsborough disaster. The IPCC will find out whether individuals should face criminal charges or misconduct hearings. When will the criminal investigations end? Both investigations could conclude by the end of this year. The IPCC is presenting its findings to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in order for decisions to be made about whether charges should be brought. The CPS will make its decisions independently, using the evidence supplied by the investigations. This is expected to take place within three to six months.

"A source within the Catholic Church also said the cardinal ""doesn't know who his accusers are and doesn't know what they're accusing him of"". The ex-Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh has been accused of inappropriate behaviour towards priests in the 1980s - allegations he contests. Cardinal O'Brien will no longer take part in the election of the new Pope. The source also said Cardinal O'Brien, Britain's most senior Roman Catholic cleric, was ""a vulnerable adult"" approaching the age of 75, the age at which he was due to retire from his position. 'Saddened' At a news conference on Tuesday, Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, a former archbishop of Westminster, said he was ""saddened"" by the resignation of Cardinal O'Brien. He added Cardinal O'Brien's decision to step down was ""up to his own conscience"". Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor also said the Church needed to undergo reform, and was asked whether his fellow cardinal had been right to stand down. ""It was up to his own conscience that he stepped down. He wasn't asked to, he decided to do that,"" he said. ""I think he thought it would be a distraction for him to be in there (at the election of the new Pope) and I think that is the main reason."" Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor described Cardinal O'Brien as a ""very honest man"" and said the allegations would be investigated. He added that reform of the Church would be high on the agenda when the cardinals gathered in Rome for the conclave to elect the Pope. ""The cardinals will be discussing not just one particular issue but some of the scandals that have afflicted the Church - the gravest one has been child abuse,"" he said. ""There's no doubt in my mind that there has to be reform, otherwise not just the image of the church but the effectiveness of the Church is also affected."" One of Scotland's leading historians said the current crisis is the biggest the Catholic Church in Scotland has faced in about 500 years. Prof Tom Devine, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said: ""This is probably the gravest single public crisis to hit the Catholic Church in Scotland since the Reformation."" In his commentary piece he added: ""Its effects in the short term are incalculable."" Cardinal O'Brien announced his resignation on Monday, following allegations in the Observer newspaper on Sunday. It said three priests and one former priest, from the diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh, had complained to the Pope's representative to Britain, nuncio Antonio Mennini, in the week before 11 February. The cardinal's resignation statement said the Pope would appoint someone to govern the archdiocese in his place, until his successor was appointed. Pope Benedict, 85, announced earlier this month that he is to resign, the first pontiff in more than 600 years to do so. He will formally quit on Thursday as leader of the global Catholic Church. Cardinal O'Brien's decision to pull out of the conclave means Britain will be unrepresented. Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor, at 80 years old, is ineligible to cast a vote but he is heading to Rome to take part in pre-meetings before the conclave begins.","The BBC has been told Cardinal Keith O'Brien is ""very upset"" over the circumstances of his resignation."
"By Clodagh RiceBusiness Reporter, BBC News NI Finnebrogue makes products such as sausages and burgers for UK retailers including Marks and Spencer, Asda and Waitrose. It began making nitrite free bacon for a mass market in 2018. Cancer specialists say nitrite-free alternatives are safer and should be more widely used. The British Meat Processors Association said nitrites are used in curing meats to help preserve them and add flavour, and they are authorised additives. 'Â£15m turnover' Company chairman Denis Lynn said: ""We've been looking at how to make bacon without nitrites for 10 years. ""We began this brand last January with zero turnover, a year later, we've turned Â£15m which is phenomenal. ""The retail sector is Â£900m in bacon, we fully expect to get 8% of that,"" he added. What is processed meat? Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is ""processed"" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. About 30 of the jobs have already been filled. The rest are expected to be created by 2022. 'Not worried about politics' Invest NI said the posts would generate Â£3m a year in salaries for the local economy. Invest NI's Brian Dolaghan said: ""The product has been welcomed by top food scientists as a significant advancement in food safety and has already found a market among health conscious consumers."" This investment comes at a time of uncertainty for the agri-food sector which has been cited as one of the sectors likely to be most affected by Brexit. Chairman Denis Lynn said: ""I don't really care about the politics because it's always going to be uncertain.

""It could affect 2 products out of 1,000 different products so we aren't really that bothered about it.""",A Downpatrick-based food manufacturer is creating 125 jobs through a Â£17m investment in a bacon processing plant.
"The course, at Menie north of Aberdeen, opened in 2012. The countryside agency Nature Scot - formerly Scottish Natural Heritage - said after construction, the area no longer merited being retained as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Trump International described the move as ""highly politicised"". The dunes are now said to not include enough special features. SNH had warned a planning inquiry that the development would seriously damage the SSSI, but permission was granted by Scottish ministers on the basis that the potential economic benefit would outweigh environmental harm. The plan was called in after it was rejected by an Aberdeenshire Council committee. SNH later concluded that the site's special features had been ""partially destroyed"" with no prospect of recovery. The denotification follows talks that have been ongoing since 2016. The decision about parts of the dunes on Foveran Links followed consideration of scientific evidence by the Protected Areas Committee (PAC) of NatureScot. Eileen Stuart, NatureScot's interim director of nature and climate change said: ""There is now no longer a reason to protect the dunes at Menie as they do not include enough of the special natural features for which they were designated. ""Trump International Golf Links Scotland have undertaken to deliver nature conservation management on the golf course and we value the work they have done to protect the remaining rare habitats and the rare plants on their site, however they no longer have sufficient scientific interest to merit special protection."" The remaining reduced SSSI at Foveran Links will be merged with the adjacent Sands of Forvie and Ythan Estuary SSSI next year. 'Singled out' Trump International executive vice president Sarah Malone criticised the decision, saying the organisation had ""spent millions of pounds on the management and monitoring"" of the site. She said: ""Nature Scot ignored and neglected the dunes under the previous ownership and has made only a handful of short visits in the past 10 years. ""Their own assessment acknowledges that many attributes of the SSSI have flourished since the golf course was completed."" Ms Malone added: ""Trump International's level of investment and ongoing care of the site far exceeds just about every other SSSI site in the country. ""And yet, Nature Scot singles us out and prioritises this decision during a global pandemic when the tourism and leisure industry is at its most vulnerable and is contending for its survival. ""Regardless of their decision, we will continue to maintain the site to the highest standards.""",The sand dunes at Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort have lost their special status as a nationally-important protected environment.

"Local health board officials say enhanced services could be provided at the proposed Llangollen health centre. But one community leader said residents want in-patient beds reinstated in the town as some are being sent to a hospital 25 miles (40km) away rather than those closer due to bed shortages. The board has been asked to comment. Llangollen hospital shut in March as part of a controversial health care shake-up by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB). Residents had been fighting to try to protect the hospital which served the community for almost 137 years. Llangollen councillor Stuart Davies claims there still is a need for more hospital beds locally. The BCUHB says it wants to hear residents' views on its plans for the new health centre earmarked on the site of the former River Lodge hotel. Other services include community nursing and midwifery services, outpatient clinics, therapies, mental health care services and social care. As well as GPs it could also be used by Denbighshire council social care and voluntary sector services as well as the health board itself. Patient watchdog the Betsi Cadwaladr Community Health Council said it was pleased the health board's plans were moving forward and it was consulting with residents.

"By Julian FowlerBBC News NI One in 150 people in Mid-Ulster were found to carry the gene, compared to one in 1,000 in Belfast and one in 2,000 in the rest of the UK. More than three-quarters of carriers will never develop health issues, but it can cause long-term problems and be potentially life-threatening for those that do. Scientists hope the work will help find those at risk of passing on the gene. The gene - called AIP, but known as the ""giant gene"" - can result in too much growth hormone, which is produced and released by the pituitary gland, a pea-sized gland just below the brain. The excessive production occurs as the result of a non-cancerous tumour in the gland. The condition, called acromegaly or gigantism, can be successfully treated with brain surgery and medication. Large hands A screening programme for the gene was undertaken in Magherafelt, Cookstown and Dungannon in 2013. The genetic mutation has been found in more than 400 people, and at least 15 families in Northern Ireland have been identified as carriers. Dr Steven Hunter, an endocrinologist at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, said only 20% of carriers will develop symptoms. ""It can present with tall stature and people growing excessively tall at a young age,"" he told the BBC. 'Life-threatening' ""It can also cause problems with growth of the hands and feet in older people and it's associated with problems related to headache because of the growing tumour in the brain and affects eyesight as well. ""We've also seen people with other hormonal problems and infertility. ""It can be life-threatening, but in many cases it's disfiguring."" There are effective treatments and the emphasis was on early diagnosis, he said. The gene caused Charles Byrne, born in 1761 near Cookstown and known as the ""Irish giant"", to grow more than 7ft 6in (2.3m) tall. He became an object of curiosity after travelling to London to seek his fortune before his death in 1783. Geneticists have identified that Mr Byrne and the living carriers of the gene shared a common ancestor who lived about 2,500 years ago. Brendan Holland, from Dungannon, is 6ft 9in (2.1m) and a distant relative of Byrne. ""It may not please the romantic in some people, but those who are afflicted with this condition probably won't object to the end of this condition,"" he said. ""I've been lucky, I've actually been cured and had the best treatment available. ""My mother passed the gene to me and she never knew that and many people still to this day are passing the gene on without knowing it."" 'Miserable life' Belfast clinical genetics consultant Prof Patrick Morrison said most people have the wrong perception of giants, believing they are ""very fit and athletic and would make great basketball players"". ""It's a miserable life for a giant, actually,"" he said. ""If you're nearly 7ft (2.1m) in height your heart doesn't work so well, you can have heart failure. Your pituitary gland can cause vision problems, you're actually quite weak. ""Maybe by your mid to late 20s you've a lot of problems and a lot of these giants will die in their late 20s if not treated."" The research into the population screening in Mid Ulster was led by Marta Korbonits, professor of endocrinology at Barts and the London School of Medicine Queen Mary. Prof Korbonits discovered the genetic link for the mutation of the Irish giant gene. The scientists hope that their work will help to identify those at risk of passing on the gene to future generations and will lead to earlier diagnosis.","An area in Northern Ireland has been identified as a ""giant hotspot"" by scientists studying a gene defect which causes people to grow abnormally tall."
"By Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, BBC News It's one of about a dozen warships and civilian vessels trying to tackle the human tide of thousands of people leaving Africa for Europe. It's no easy task. They're having to cover an area of around 70,000 square miles, trying to spot the small boats crammed with desperate people hoping to be rescued and taken to a safer world. Bulwark was already sailing towards the Libyan coast when we flew on board by Merlin helicopters. Over the past month she's already rescued almost 1,800 people. The helicopters have helped spot thousands more, directing other ships to help. And as soon as we landed there were reports of another 3,000 migrants leaving Libya's shores in 14 boats. The figures are staggering, as is the scale of the problem. More than 43,000 people have already crossed the Mediterranean this year - that's a 50% increase on the numbers for last year. There are an estimated half a million people now in Libya waiting to make the same crossing. The officer in charge of the British contribution to this search and rescue mission, Commodore Martin Connell, says it's ""tragic"". It is, he says, ""the most grim situation you could possibly find. Most of these boats won't make it"". They're picking up people in inflatable dinghies and rotting wooden vessels that often don't even have an engine. The human traffickers responsible for this trade in human misery often just leave the people who've paid them hundreds of dollars to drift in the ocean. ""If I could get my hands on some of these smugglers"" he says, before pausing and adding simply: ""they don't have much regard for human life."" On Saturday afternoon the defence secretary also flew out to Bulwark to get a briefing from the commodore and to thank him and the crew for their work. But even Michael Fallon admitted to me that this was like putting sticking plaster on a massive problem. He said European countries needed to work together to tackle the root cause - the criminal gangs that trade on human misery - and try to bring stability to countries in chaos. Not just Libya from where most of these migrants leave, but also their countries of origin across east and West Africa. Mr Fallon is giving little detail about how that can be achieved, other than insisting it won't involve putting ""British boots"" on the ground. But there is, so far, little sign of reaching a consensus. While Britain is helping rescue the migrants, it's not offering them asylum. Some EU nations want to share the burden of resettling refugees, but the UK is one of a number of countries resisting that move. Over a nine-hour period on Saturday, European warships and coastguard vessels rescued another 3,000 migrants. Commodore Martin Connell says he can't remember ""so many vessels rescuing so many people in such a short time"". In the morning Bulwark will launch her helicopters and landing craft in the expectation that they will be taking on more desperate people.",Tonight HMS Bulwark is poised to carry out another rescue of migrants.
"It will look at the ""cost, practicality and demand for a new fixed link"". Downing Street said the study will also consider boosting road and rail access to Scotland from the rest of the UK. However Scotland's Transport Secretary Michael Matheson raised concerns that the study undermined devolution. He said the review had been organised with ""virtually no consultation"" with the Scottish government, despite transport being devolved to Holyrood. Mr Matheson has previously said the bridge plan was a Â£20bn ""vanity project"" and the money could be better spent on other projects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has in the past described the prospect of link across the Irish Sea as a ""very interesting idea"". Launching the latest review, he said new transport projects could help the UK recover from the Covid pandemic and improve access to ""jobs and opportunities"" across the country. Two routes have been suggested for the link with Northern Ireland - from Portpatrick to Larne, or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. Any link between Portpatrick and Larne would have to overcome the challenge of Beaufort's Dyke - a deep submarine trench where an estimated one million tonnes of weapons have been jettisoned. A bridge from Campbeltown would be cheaper, but transport links to the area are poor. The independent review is intended to look at ways to improve connections and create new ones across Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. It will be led by Sir Peter Hendy, the chairman of Network Rail. Downing Street said it would provide ""independent, honest advice"" on improving transport links, while considering their cost feasibility and value for money. The UK government has also asked Sir Peter to consider likely future transport need and technological developments over the next 20-30 years. In addition to the fixed link between Scotland and Northern Ireland and improving road and rail links to Scotland, it will look at: The prime minister said: ""Quality transport links are the key to making sure everyone can access education, jobs and housing, helping businesses to grow and thrive and rebalancing opportunity fairly across our country. ""As we build back better from the pandemic, Sir Peter's review will help make sure we have the right connections to support, sustain and strengthen our communities - to truly level up across the UK."" The Scottish government said it wanted to see improved transport links but warned about the effect of the review on devolution. Mr Matheson said: ""There is a real possibility that the Tories spending money on their own priorities in Scotland will see money being salami sliced from Scotland's budget - that is completely unacceptable both to me and no doubt the vast majority of people in Scotland. ""While I will seek to engage constructively with the UK government, I will absolutely not sign up to anything which in any way undermines the devolution settlement. The ball is in the UK government's court to prove that this is not the case - but thus far I frankly have little confidence in this process."" Sir Peter's formal recommendations are expected to be published in summer 2021.",The feasibility of building a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland will be examined as part of a national review of transport connections across the UK.
"Peers accepted the General Synod proposal, passed by the Synod in July, without a vote. It is expected to be approved by MPs next week, allowing it to become law. Speaking in the Lords, the archbishop urged the government to bring in legislation to allow women bishops to join him in the upper house. Under the current system, the places are reserved for the archbishops of Canterbury and York, and the bishops Durham, London and Winchester. The other 21 go to the remaining bishops who have served the longest time in office. 'Frustration' The Bishops and Priests (Consecration and Ordination of Women) Measure passed through the General Synod in July by the required two-thirds majority. Archbishop Welby told peers: ""Over the past 20 years, many women have given outstanding leadership as vicars, archdeacons and cathedral deans. ""Now, for the first time, every post will be open to them. For many people within the Church of England and others it has been a process full of frustration when looked at from the outside."" Calling for legislation before the general election, he said the bishops benches in the Lords would eventually include women ""but that could take some time if the normal seniority system were simply left to take its course"". To laughter from peers, he added: ""We have a bunch of young, vigorous bishops who aren't going to retire too soon. And they really don't die very often."" Adding his support to the measure Lord Lloyd of Berwick, chairman of the ecclesiastical committee, asked: ""What has the fuss all been about?"" The former lord justice of appeal said the qualities necessary to make a good bishop were every bit as frequently found in women as in men. Conservative Baroness Berridge said the change presented an opportunity for the Church to be a role model for Britain's boardrooms, the armed forces and Parliament itself.","Allowing women to become bishops is ""long overdue"", the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said, as the change was approved by the Lords."
"By Neil PriorBBC News Scientists from Aberystwyth University, University College London and National Museum of Wales have located the specific outcrop, Carn Goedog, in the Preseli Mountains. This is where the distinctive spotted dolerites originated. The findings are to be published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. Geologist Herbert Henry Thomas first proposed in 1923 that the rocks which form the giant inner ring were specifically quarried for Stonehenge by Neolithic man around 5,000 years ago, and were hauled to Wiltshire via land and sea. However, other geologists theorise that they were carried east on an ice-age glacier 20,000 years ago. While the new discovery will not answer the debate, according to Dr Richard Bevins, of the National Museum Wales, it may eliminate some of the unknown variables. ""I'm not here to come down on one side of the argument or the other,"" he explained. ""But our research is aimed at better informing the debate."" Dr Bevins, keeper of natural sciences, added: ""Trying to match the rocks at Stonehenge to a specific outcrop is considerably more complicated than looking for a needle in a haystack but the more we can trace them back to their original source, the closer archaeologists and geologists can hunt for clues to back-up their theories. ""Archaeologists can now search an area of hundreds of metres rather than hundreds of kilometres for evidence of Neolithic quarrying. ""While geologists supporting the glacier theory know exactly where to hunt for the scarring they'd expect to find on the landscape if enormous chunks of the stone had indeed been swept east on a glacier."" As the name suggests, the spotted dolerites have highly distinctive markings created by the elements contained within, cooling at different rates in the minutes after they were spewed out of an underwater volcano 450 million years ago. In 2011, Dr Bevins's team located the source of another of Stonehenge's Pembrokeshire Bluestones - the rhyolites - 3km away from the spotted dolerites at Craig Rhos y Felin. Although the relative proximity of the two discoveries offers evidence to both camps. ""Three kilometres is both closer and farther away than expected, depending on which theory you support. ""From a geologist's point of view, 3km is nothing, and the rocks which ended up close to each other in Wiltshire could easily have been carried on the same glacier. ""However, for the archaeologists a distance of 3km between the potential quarries could be seen as evidence of planning and forethought, and a suggestion that the different types of stone were chosen for some specific purpose."" 'Each piece of the puzzle' Dr Bevins's team are able to say so categorically that they have discovered the source of the spotted dolerites thanks to a range of laser mass spectrometry techniques which analyse both the chemical composition of the rock and the microbiology present when it was formed. He says that the chance of them having originated anywhere other than Carn Goedog is ""statistically-speaking, infinitesimally small"". And while he is the first to admit that this discovery on its own gets us no closer to solving the riddle, he believes a definitive answer will come eventually. ""I've been studying the bluestones for over 30 years now, and I'm no closer to finding an answer which convinces me either way. But the one thing which I am increasingly sure of is that each piece of the puzzle we find brings us another step closer to the truth.

"Allen Woodhouse was one of several tourists who sued Lochs and Glens (Transport Ltd) after the accident in March 2015. The coach came off the road in high winds before stopping near a small loch outside Arrochar in Argyll. Five of the 51 people on board were seriously injured. Eighteen others had to be treated in hospital. One passenger described how it felt like ""being in a washing machine"" as the coach rolled down the embankment. Police did not charge driver Elizabeth Gallon after concluding that the accident was caused by freak gusts of wind. Lawyers acting for Mr Woodhouse claimed that Ms Gallon was driving too quickly for the prevailing weather conditions. Last year, judge Lord Glennie ruled against Mr Woodhouse saying his legal team had not proven their case. However, civil appeal judges Lord Carloway, Lord Woolman and Lord Pentland have now ruled against their colleague. In a judgment issued at the Court of Session, the judges concluded that Lord Glennie had applied the wrong legal test in making his decision. Awarding Mr Woodhouse the Â£15,000 he had been seeking, Lord Carloway wrote: ""It was not for the pursuer to prove that the speed of the bus was excessive for the conditions. ""It was for the defenders to prove that it was not and, in any event, that the bus driver had not failed to take reasonable care to keep the bus on the carriageway. ""Speed may have contributed to the accident but it was the driver's loss of control of the bus which was the ultimate operative cause. ""The defenders had the task of proving that the loss of control was not negligent.

"The Covid lockdown meant Gordon Bonner, 86, from Leeds, was unable to see his wife, Muriel, for over a month before her death as she was in a care home. He said their forced separation before she died in hospital meant he struggled to process his grief. ""For weeks I had the feeling she was still in lockdown,"" he said. Mr Bonner has shared his story as part of National Grief Awareness Week, which is highlighting the impact of Covid-19 this year. As part of the week, buildings across Leeds, including the Town Hall and City Museum, have been lit up in yellow to remember those who have lost loved ones.

He described a historic inquiry into his professional behaviour in 2015 as being ""like a witch hunt"". Lord Janner, who denied all charges against him, died in 2015. Mr Creedon has spoken out after the recent Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heard he was ordered not to arrest Lord Janner, ""despite credible evidence"". The inquiry, which is due to publish its findings in 2021, was not set up to determine Lord Janner's guilt or innocence but to look at how authorities reacted to multiple allegations dating back decades. 'Was stunned' Mr Creedon, who became chief constable of Derbyshire Police in 2007, said allegations against him appeared after he voiced concerns his investigation into Lord Janner had been halted on orders from above. ""I was stunned. It had a huge effect on my family, my marriage, my friendships and it tends to take over,"" he told the BBC. ""Because at the end of the day the offences which I was being investigated for carry life imprisonment. ""It felt to me like a witch-hunt. I was treated like a corrupt officer.""

He said Mr Creedon was the victim of ""malicious rumours, myths and outright lies"". ""I was a respected chief constable and I think they saw me as a target,"" he added. He was among several police officers referred by Leicestershire Police over complaints of unprofessionalism over the Janner inquiry. ""I believe it was a vindictive response. Within four to five weeks they gathered a range of information about me - all of which has since proved to be false,"" he said.

He said Retail NI ""wants to see sensible and fair enforcement of car parking and bus lanes and an end to this current excessive strategy"".

"The owls are occupying a nestbox at the trust's Redgrave and Lopham Fen reserve, in the north of the county. On Friday the female laid her first egg so will remain in the box to lay more and keep them warm. The male will be hunting regularly to feed his family. The trust said it hoped the feed would become captivating viewing while highlighting the plight of the birds. Oka Last, Suffolk Wildlife Trust's barn owl adviser, said the female would typically lay an egg every other day, up to a total of 14. Chicks should hatch after about 30 days of the egg being laid. The maximum brood size in Suffolk, says Ms Last, is about eight - with an average of only two or three chicks surviving to eventually leave the nestbox. It is the first time the trust has set up a live webstream for barn owls. Barn owl numbers are at a 50-year high in Suffolk.

"Both sides are due to decide by the end of June whether the current deadline for negotiating an agreement should be extended beyond the end of December. The UK has said it will not agree to an extension, even if the EU requests one. The latest round of talks, to be held via video link, will end on Friday. After the latest round in April, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said progress had been disappointing, whilst the UK said only ""limited progress"" had been made. There are differences between the two sides on fisheries, competition rules, police co-operation, and how a deal would be enforced. BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler said the EU accuses the UK of concentrating on its priorities whilst going slow on issues more important to the 27-member bloc. She added that the UK wants to first settle a core trade deal alongside deals on aviation and energy, whilst the EU is keen to focus on fishing quotas and competition rules. She added that although the UK has ruled out extending the talks, leaving tricky areas to the autumn could be risky if coronavirus infections peak again. Negotiations have been held using video-conferencing technology since last month after face-to-face meetings were cancelled due to the pandemic. The UK has rejected the suggestion it is not engaging in all negotiating areas, accusing the EU of making demands not required of its other trade partners. Transition extension calls The UK is currently in a transition period under which it must follow most EU regulations, following its legal withdrawal from the bloc on 31 January. Both sides exchanged legal text on a future trade deal in March. After the negotiations this week, a fourth round of talks is scheduled to begin on 1 June. Under the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU, both sides currently have until 31 December to ratify a trade deal and rules for future co-operation. An extension to the December deadline should be made by the UK-EU ""joint committee"" overseeing the agreement by 1 July. Opposition parties including the Liberal Democrats and the SNP have both called on the UK government to extend the transition period beyond December. Shortly after becoming Labour leader last month, Sir Keir Starmer said the UK should prolong talks beyond December if ""necessary to do so"". He added that the December deadline was ""going to be very, very tight,"" and he thought it ""unlikely"" the government would finish talks in time. But the government insists it is committed to agreeing a deal by December 2020, and an extension would simply prolong disruption for businesses.","Talks between the UK and EU over a post-Brexit trade deal will enter their third round later, ahead of a decisive summit next month."
"The two are embroiled in a long-running dispute over the role of guards, with talks due to begin on Wednesday. Parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR) asked Acas to mediate in an attempt to avert what the firm said was ""damaging"" and ""unnecessary"" strike action. It has set a deadline of Thursday to avoid the strike schedule. Southern services have been beset by delays and cancellations for weeks due to the dispute and staff shortages, which the company has blamed on high levels of sickness. The RMT has offered to suspend the week-long strike - due to begin on Monday - if Southern puts its plans for guards on hold. The plans involve new trains where the driver operates the doors using CCTV but the RMT fears job losses and has safety concerns. It said the safety of the travelling public on ""dangerously overcrowded trains and platforms"" was ""the fundamental issue at the heart of this dispute"". 'Perennial problem' If the strike goes ahead, Southern said it would run a restricted service. Many routes would have fewer trains and some routes would have none at all. However, it said with the use of ""contingency"" conductors it would run almost 60% of its normal timetable. GTR passenger service director Angie Doll said: ""We are sorry that our passengers once again look set to suffer further disruption because of the RMT."" She said the action was unnecessary as the plans would cost no-one their jobs and would free up staff on board trains to better serve passengers. She also claimed the changes would lead to fewer cancellations in future. ""The new on-board supervisor will be able to go anywhere on our network, significantly reducing the perennial problem of train cancellations due to conductors not being available when they're delayed by disruption, for example,"" she said. 'Walk away from commitments' At an evening rally in Brighton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for an end to Southern's franchise and repeated his party's commitment to return railways to public ownership. He said: ""They should have said, 'if you cut the services, we'll cut you out'. But that would take a government that stood up for people. ""What is the point of a franchise agreement â¦ if a company can walk away from their commitments at no cost?"" When the strike dates were announced, rail minister Paul Maynard said RMT bosses were overlooking their impact on the travelling public and claimed GTR's changes would modernise services and be better for passengers .","Southern has promised to run 60% of its normal timetable if a five-day strike by the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union (RMT) goes ahead."

"The remains of a road and other artefacts have also been found in Castle Street about 100 metres from the castle itself. Contractors working for Dwr Cymru Welsh Water made the find in May. Experts say the finds are ""incredibly important"" and could provide a new insight into medieval Conwy. Ashley Batten, senior planning archaeologist with the Gwynedd Archaeological Planning Service, said the remains could date from before the revolt against English forces, when it is thought that the entire town was burnt to the ground about 1401. The earliest upstanding domestic building within the town walls is the National Trust run Ty Aberconwy which is dated between 1417-20. The latest find is ""incredibly important,"" Mr Batten said.

A spokesman said drivers were suffering ""chronic fatigue"" and had ""had enough"". Transport for London (TfL) said it was ""such a complex and multifaceted issue there [was] no quick single fix"". A survey of bus drivers carried out last year found that 17% of those who responded had fallen asleep while driving the bus at least once in the past 12 months. The survey was part of a report carried out by Loughborough University into bus driver fatigue in the capital. Of the 1,353 drivers who completed it, 21% said they had to ""fight sleepiness"" at least two to three times per week, while 36% said they had experienced a ""close call"" in the past 12 months because of fatigue.

"The so-called T-charge will see the owners of older, more polluting cars face an extra Â£10 fee for entering the congestion charge zone. However, critics called it ""pointless"" and said it would have little effect. Mr Khan said his critics had consistently opposed efforts to improve air quality. Conservative London Assembly environment spokesman, Shaun Bailey, said Transport for London's (TfL) consultation on the T-charge showed the charge would have a negligible effect on air pollution in the city. TfL's assessment said: ""As this scheme affects just 7% of vehicles entering the Congestion Charge zone, the anticipated reduction in air pollution is low and it was felt that air quality concentration modelling would not produce any significant results."" It added the scheme was still considered to be an important part of a transition towards the introduction of an expanded ultra low emission zone in the capital, which it is believed would have much greater impact on air quality. London's ultra low emission zone, which currently surrounds central London, would be extended to the north and south circular roads by 2020, under the mayor's proposals. Mr Bailey claimed up to 9,000 drivers a day could be hit with the additional charge netting City Hall an estimated Â£23m a year. ""Under assessment by his own people, the mayor's flagship air pollution policy is predicted to have only a 'negligible' impact on air quality, reducing poisonous NOx gasses by just 1-3%,"" he added. Mr Bailey added the charge would inflict ""crippling additional costs on small businesses"" as well as causing ""expense, disruption and bureaucracy for London residents."" However, Mr Khan hit back saying the Conservatives should be ""thoroughly ashamed of themselves"" for opposing his plans to tackle air pollution, which he said had the support of a range of experts. City Hall also suggested the Â£23m figure was highly misleading as it assumed no change in the behaviour of drivers after the T-charge was introduced. Simon Birkett, founder and director of Clean Air in London, said: ""It's disappointing that anyone is campaigning against action on diesel less than a week after London breached the legal limit for hourly exposure to nitrogen dioxide for a whole year in five days.

"That is according to Northern Ireland Fire & Rescue Service (NIFRS), which appealed to people to stop lighting fires in the countryside. It comes after firefighters battled a ""significant"" wildfire incident in County Down that had been ongoing for more than 24 hours. It has since been brought under control. The blaze in Castlewellan, County Down, broke out at about 13:30 BST on Friday on the Leitrim Road. Mark Smyth, NIFRS area commander, said the fire front has been extinguished. ""The crews will be there for quite a few hours today just mopping up and putting plenty of water on it, hopefully to stop any reignition,"" he told BBC News NI.

NIFRS had appealed for people to stay away, but the Leitrim Road has since reopened. Officers from NIFRS' specialist wildfire team, high volume pump and specialist rescue teams all attended the scene. Mr Smyth said that people need to stop lighting fires in the countryside. ""We've had over five hundred incidents of wildfire, gorse-related vegetation-type fires across Northern Ireland. I would say that's probably ... two to three times busier than any other Aprils we've had."" Mr Smyth said most wildfires in Northern Ireland are ""human made"". ""We don't have really natural wildfires in Northern Ireland. We normally have human intervention. I look at them being deliberate in that someone has actually deliberately lit a fire but sometimes it's then accidental or malicious after it being deliberate. ""It's accidental that they've lit a fire and it's got away from them and away it goes.

The prime minister has promised MPs it will be published - but it is yet to appear. He said on Wednesday that it would be disclosed after the committee, which was disbanded at December's election, is up and running again. But former chair of the committee, Dominic Grieve, told the BBC the reasons for its non-publication are ""entirely bogus"". What is the Intelligence and Security Committee? It was set up in 1994 in order to allow Parliamentarians to scrutinise the work of the UK's security services. The nine-member committee is made up of MPs and peers from different parties - ministers are not allowed to be members. Under the Justice and Security Act 2013, they are allowed to examine the ""expenditure, administration, policy and operations"" of MI6, MI5, GCHQ, and the government. In the last few years, the committee has published reports on issues including the terrorist attacks in 2017 and diversity in the intelligence industry. Unlike other committees in Parliament, the prime minister has power over who is a member - although the chair is chosen by members themselves. What is the Russia report? The decision to start an inquiry into Russian interference in the UK was partly prompted by developments after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. The committee's annual report mentioned the US intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible interference in the Brexit referendum. After the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March, the investigation became the ""primary focus"" of the committee in 2018. The report was completed in March 2019, but then had to go through a process of redaction, where the government and security agencies make sure no confidential information is published. Mr Grieve told MPs that this process had finished and the report was sent to the prime minister on 17 October. Usually, once a report is signed off, it can be presented to Parliament - and therefore the public. What does the government say? During a BBC Question Time special in the run-up to the election, Mr Johnson said he saw ""no reason to interfere in the normal timetable for these things just because there's an election going on"". He added that he had seen ""absolutely no evidence"" of interference in ""any British electoral event"". Ministers have also argued that it is not unusual for there to be a delay between sign-off and publication, which is why nothing was released before the general election in December. Now that a new Parliament has formed, the committee has to be set up from scratch. It is probably only once this has happened that the document can be released. When pressed on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: ""The report will of course be published...when the Intelligence and Security Committee is reconstituted."" He went on to accuse SNP MP Owen Thompson, who said the lack of publication so far was unacceptable, of having a ""conspiratorial frame of mind"". But the formation of the new committee is largely the responsibility of the government, which has to consult the leader of the Labour Party regarding its members. Where are we now? It all comes down to how quickly a new committee can be formed. After the 2017 election, it took many months and there is no sign of progress at this stage. It is unclear what - if anything - will come from the publication of the report itself. Mr Grieve said the document had ""never been marketed by anybody as having smoking gun properties"", making the delay ""all the more mysterious"". He added: ""I would be surprised if we were to see it before Easter"". Asked to comment, a UK government spokesperson declined to add anything beyond what Mr Johnson has previously told Parliament.",A long-awaited Parliamentary report into alleged Russian interference in UK democracy is yet to be published.
"The British Pregnancy Advisory Service service said it will offer advice to women concerned about any symptoms they have after taking the illegal pills. However, anti-abortion campaigners have said the helpline is a ""publicity stunt"". The law surrounding abortion in Northern Ireland is much stricter than in the rest of the UK. A woman can have an abortion, but only in very specific circumstances. Illegal pills It is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. Taking drugs to bring on a miscarriage without doctors' consent is an offence anywhere in the UK under the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act. Criminal offence The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS) said that while adverse events were ""extremely unlikely"", some women may not seek help from a doctor when they need it because they are committing a criminal offence. The service will also be available in the Republic of Ireland and the Isle of Man. Ann Furedi, chief executive of the BPAS, said: ""What these women really need are accessible, high-quality abortion services at home. ""They shouldn't have to make the choice between travelling to England and breaking the law by purchasing pills online. ""While we wait for politicians to do the right thing, BPAS will provide telephone aftercare to women who have bought pills online and who want to speak to someone in confidence about what they are experiencing, or who simply need a reassuring voice at the end of the line. ""We will be here for these women 24 hours a day until they no longer need us."" 'Publicity stunt' However, Marion Woods of the anti-abortion group, Life NI, told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster that the helpline was ""a publicity stunt"". She said support for women needing help should be provided ""within the framework of our law"". Mrs Woods said a newspaper advertisement issued by BPAS ""challenges our government, challenges our law"". ""How safe are these pills in the first place?"" she added. Dawn McAvoy, spokeswoman for the Evangelical Alliance, said women needed support. ""Groups need to work together to provide the best possible care for women and children within the current law, because both lives matter,"" she said. ""We want Northern Ireland to continue to value the life and health of the woman and the unborn child, advancing the wellbeing of both because both lives matter."" Breedagh Hughes, Northern Ireland director of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said ""anything that helps women that find themselves in a very distressing situation can only be helpful"". She said the RCM was ""quite clear that they should not be obtaining pills online, that we would much prefer that this was a prescribed medication given under medical direction"". Ms Hughes said they feared that ""we may begin to see over the next few years women begin to die again from botched abortions. ""It's a backstreet abortion using another method. It's not coat hangers anymore, it's pills bought online"". In a statement, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said it ""would like to take this opportunity to remind members of the public not to take any prescription drugs that have not been prescribed to them. ""The taking of any prescription drug is potentially very harmful and can result in developing serious complications if used without the appropriate medical supervision"".",A telephone helpline has been set up in Northern Ireland for women who have bought so-called abortion pills online.
"By Stuart NicolsonBBC Scotland News For journalists used to covering Scottish courts, the case has followed standard procedures that remain exactly the same regardless of who the accused is. But for people with little or no experience of the Scottish legal system, which is very different from the one in England, some of what has - and has not - been reported might seem a bit strange. Here's an explanation of what has happened so far, what is likely to happen next - and why the media is now not able to go into as much detail about the case as you might expect. What has happened so far? Mr Salmond was arrested by officers from Police Scotland after voluntarily attending a police station on Wednesday. He was formally charged with a total of 14 offences - two attempted rapes, nine sexual assaults, two indecent assaults and a breach of the peace. The former SNP leader was released on bail by the police after his arrest, before appearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Thursday afternoon. Because the allegations against him are so serious, and could carry a lengthy prison sentence if he is convicted, the case is being dealt with through what is known as solemn procedure. As with all solemn cases, Mr Salmond's first court appearance was held in private - with only Mr Salmond, his lawyer, the Sheriff, prosecutors and court officials allowed to attend. A legal document known as a petition which outlines the charges against Mr Salmond was read to him. Mr Salmond made no plea during the hearing, which is again completely standard procedure in solemn cases and he was not asked whether he was pleading guilty or not guilty. After being granted bail by the sheriff, Mr Salmond told reporters outside the court that he is ""innocent of any criminality"" and would defend himself ""to the utmost"" during the case. As with all solemn cases, details of the petition were given to the media after the hearing and can be reported. What is likely to happen next? No date has yet been fixed for the next hearing in the case, but any trial - which for attempted rape cases would generally be held before a judge and jury at the High Court - should start within the next 12 months. In reality, however, trials are often delayed and start more than a year later. In the meantime, prosecutors and Mr Salmond's legal team will continue to prepare their respective cases and it is possible that some or all of the charges against him will change, or even be dropped completely. At some point over the next few months, an indictment will be served on Mr Salmond, which details the charges on which he would stand trial. Dates will also be set for a trial and a preliminary hearing. The preliminary hearing must be held at least 29 days after the indictment is served, and is essentially a pre-trial hearing. At this point, Mr Salmond will be asked for the first time whether he is pleading guilty or not guilty. If the plea is not guilty, both the Crown and defence lawyers will give details of their case to the court, including how many witnesses they intend to call, how long the trial would be expected to last and whether any special defences - such as alibi, incrimination or self defence - are being lodged. If both sides have fully prepared their cases, it can proceed to the trial date. Alternatively, more preliminary hearings can be held to allow them to update the court on their progress. Juries in Scotland have 15 members of the public sitting on them. After hearing evidence from both the Crown and the defence, the jury reaches a verdict of guilty, not guilty or not proven either unanimously or by a majority. The not proven verdict is a unique - and highly controversial - feature of the Scottish legal system, and you can read more about it here. What can people say about the case now? As soon as someone is arrested in Scotland, strict rules come into force which severely limit what the media is able to say about the case. In effect, this means that journalists are able to report the name of the accused and the charges they face - but cannot go into detail about the background to the case, the evidence that might be heard or the possible outcome. These Contempt of Court laws tend to be more strictly adhered to in Scotland than they are elsewhere in the UK, and are designed to ensure that the accused - no matter who they are - is able to receive a fair trial without jurors being swayed by media speculation. This is particularly tricky for a high-profile figure such as Mr Salmond, and the Crown Office has stressed that the contempt laws also apply to social media and blogs - meaning anyone who tweets or posts anything that could potentially prejudice the case could face prosecution. Anyone found guilty of contempt can be jailed for up to two years, or face a heavy fine. The media will also never identify the alleged victims in any case involving sexual offences unless those victims waive their right to anonymity.",The arrest and subsequent court appearance by former first minister Alex Salmond on charges including attempted rape and sexual assault have sent shockwaves through Scottish - and British - politics.
"Independent mayor, Andy Preston, said ""sinister"" things were happening to try to ""discredit"" him. His statement came after a complaint was lodged by the town's Labour MP, Andy McDonald. Middlesbrough Council confirmed earlier this week it was ""assessing"" an allegation about the mayor's behaviour. Writing on Facebook, Mr Preston said it stemmed from an alleged incident last year which he had been unaware of at the time as he was out of the office at a meeting. He said the matter came to light recently after his deputy received an anonymous warning about a plot to oust him. 'Done nothing wrong' Mr Preston said the tip-off referred to inappropriate material on his computer, which he then queried with the council's chief executive. He said he was told it could have been a reference to a ""GIF-like"" image seen on his laptop, which was removed by a member of staff before the mayor returned from his meeting. Mr Preston added: ""Not only did I never see any such image, this alleged incident from about a year ago was never mentioned to me by anyone and was never reported or recorded as being any kind of issue - until just four weeks ago. ""I have no idea how the alleged image ever appeared, but I know that I have done absolutely nothing wrong."" Mr Preston said the council's most senior legal officer decided no further action was needed. Continuing his Facebook post, he alleged details were then leaked to Mr McDonald, adding: ""It's fair to say we don't get on."" Mr McDonald said: ""There is a formal investigative process under way and I trust Mr Preston will fully co-operate with it so that this matter can be brought to a conclusion.""

Emergency services were called but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.

"The NHS Information Services Division (ISD) said there were 784 probable suicides in Scotland in 2018 - up from 680 in 2017. National mental health charity SAMH described the figures as ""devastating"". Mental Health Minister Clare Haughey said the increase was ""concerning"" - but was in contrast to a fall in the suicide rate over the previous decade. The new ISD figures highlight that the rate of suicide is three times higher in the most deprived areas of Scotland. They also show that men are markedly more likely to take their own lives than women. Underlying reasons Scotland has had a higher recorded suicide rate than the UK as a whole since the early 1990s, although the ISD said this may be due to the variation in recording practice. Ms Haughey added: ""We want to create a Scotland where suicide is preventable and where anyone contemplating suicide gets the support they need. ""Scotland is not alone in tackling suicide prevention and we will undertake more research to establish the underlying reasons for the increase in 2018."" She said the government was committed to building on the falls in suicide rates between 2004-2008 and 2014-2018. ""Alongside mental health and suicide prevention groups, we are working to raise public awareness and improve crisis support services for at risk groups,"" she added. The Scottish government published its suicide prevention action plan in August 2018. A National Suicide Prevention Leadership Group has been established, and is due to publish its first annual report in September. 'A stark reminder' SAMH chief executive Billy Watson said: ""After a number of years in which we saw an overall downward trend, it is devastating news that significantly more people died by suicide in Scotland last year than in the year before. ""Today's figures show we must redouble our efforts as a nation to deepen our understanding of the causes of suicide, so we can help everyone who needs it. ""At SAMH we are committed to playing our part in this."" James Jopling, the executive director of Samaritans Scotland, said it was ""particularly concerned"" by an increase in the suicide rate for under-25s, which had risen to its highest level since 2007. ""After years of steady progress, this should serve as a stark reminder that further action is needed to better understand and address all the factors that contribute to suicide - particularly among young people,"" he said.

"The conservative academic was recently named as chairman of a new public body to encourage better designed homes. But Labour said past ""hateful"" comments about homosexuality, which he once said was ""not normal"", and Islamophobia, which he called a ""propaganda word"", raised questions about his suitability. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said his views had been misrepresented. The philosopher's character had been ""smeared"", Mr Brokenshire told MPs, saying he was ""uniquely qualified"" for the role because he was a world-leading authority on aesthetics. One of the UK's leading public intellectuals and the author of more than 50 books, Sir Roger was named as chairman of the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission earlier this month. The unpaid appointment has divided opinion, with Labour and Lib Dem MPs saying he is unsuitable because of remarks he has made in the past on social, religious and moral issues. 'Conspiracy theories' In an article for the Daily Telegraph in 2007, Sir Roger wrote: ""Every now and then, however, we wake up to the fact that, although homosexuality has been normalised, it is not normal."" In an interview for online magazine Spiked in 2016, he said: ""Lesbianism is usually an attempt by a woman to find that committed love that she can't get from men any more."" In a 2005 lecture in the United States, he said date rape was not a crime and what ""supposed"" victims were actually saying was: ""'The whole thing went too quickly,' you know, 'I was not prepared,' and so consent is withdrawn as it were in retrospect."" Speaking in Hungary in 2016 on the future of Europe and the nation state, he made remarks about the financier George Soros which one Labour MP has said amounted to ""peddling anti-Semitic conspiracy theories"". ""Many of the Budapest intelligentsia are Jewish and form part of the extensive networks around the Soros empire,"" Sir Roger said. He added: ""As the world knows, indigenous anti-Semitism still plays a part in Hungarian society and politics and presents an obstacle to the emergence of a shared national loyalty among ethnic Hungarians and Jews."" 'Due diligence' Raising the appointment in the House of Commons, shadow communities secretary Andrew Gwynne suggested Sir Roger had made a number of other ""unacceptable"" comments, including ""speaking favourably"" of far-right movements such as the National Front. ""If we are going to have a society which welcomes free speech, we should hold people to account for what they use that privilege to say,"" he said. His Labour colleague Clive Efford said what was at stake was not defending freedom of speech but whether someone who had ""extreme views"" was suitable for a high-profile public role. But a succession of Conservative MPs offered their support to Sir Roger, saying the selective quotes cited by his critics were not a proper reflection of his arguments. Jacob Rees-Mogg said as a philosopher his role was to ""advance debate and discussion"" on difficult issues, while Bob Seely said the government should not allow itself ""to be bullied by the thought police rent-a-mob"". Mr Brokenshire said ""due diligence"" had been carried out before the appointment and ministers did not have to agree with all Sir Roger's ""strong and controversial views"", some of which he said he had changed his mind on, to recognise the contribution he could make. ""It saddens me that someone who has done so much to champion freedom of speech, expression and thought should be subject to such misinformed, ill judged and personal attacks we have seen over the last few days."" Sir Roger has said he is ""offended and hurt"" by suggestions that he is any way anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, insisting ""nothing could be further than the truth"". In a statement on his blog last week, he said: ""If people actually read my comments regarding the interplay between George Soros and Hungary, they will realise they are not in any way anti-Semitic, indeed quite the opposite. ""My statements on Islamic states points only to the failure of these states, which is a fact. ""My views on Islam are well known and can be found in my book The West And The Rest.""","Ministers have defended the choice of Sir Roger Scruton to head a new housing body, amid calls for him to quit."
"The move by the three local councils would take the number of authorities which have launched similar campaigns to six. Caerphilly was the first of the 22 councils to take similar action, with Powys and Gwynedd following. Anti-smoking charity Ash Wales says it hopes more councils will follow suit. Although councils cannot ban smoking, youngsters have already designed a poster discouraging smoking. This will be going up at park play areas over the coming weeks. Swansea council cabinet member June Burtonshaw said: ""Children are much more likely to grow up as non-smokers if their parents don't smoke or those that do give up now. ""So this new campaign is aimed at urging parents to do the right thing, not just for their own health, but for their youngsters' health too. ""We won't be banning parents from smoking at children's play areas but what we're hoping is that in combination with the notices we're putting up parents who smoke will think twice."" She added: ""Second-hand smoke causes health problems like cancer and heart disease just as much as smoking does. ""And in these days when people are having to cut back, giving up smoking can do wonders for the bank balance as well as people's health. There's probably never been a better time to give up."" Ash chief executive Elen de Lacy said Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend would provide safer environments for children to play as a result of the campaign. ""Children and young people have a right to play and meet with their friends in a clean environment free from second hand smoke and cigarette litter,"" she said. ""Smoking in family-friendly places such as playgrounds also creates the impression for them that it's a harmless activity but the reality is that smoking kills more than 5,000 people a year in Wales."" 'Follow the lead' A survey by Yougov in 2013 for Ash Wales revealed that 77% of Welsh adults now believed that smoking should be banned in areas where children play. Ms de Lacy added: ""We want to see smoking banned in every play area in Wales and we urge other councils to follow the lead."" The Welsh government previously said it would work with local authorities on introducing smoke-free playgrounds. Neath Port Talbot council, which runs 42 playgrounds in the area, said that while no legislation has been created that would ban smoking it hoped the majority of people would read the signs and not smoke in front of children. Phil White, Bridgend council's cabinet member for communities, said the authority maintained around 110 playgrounds and play areas and hopes to roll the initiative out across all of them. ""As well as protecting children's immediate health and cutting back on smoking-related litter, we want to encourage children not to grow up under the impression that smoking within a family-friendly environment is entirely normal or healthy behaviour,"" he added. ""With smoking already prohibited within public buildings in Wales, this is the logical next step in encouraging more people to live healthier, smoke-free lives.""","Smokers will be urged not to light up around children's park playgrounds in Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Bridgend as part of a campaign."

"The decline at HMP Lewes in East Sussex was ""difficult to understand"", Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke said. He said an inspection in January found a ""significant increase"" in assaults on members of prison staff. An X-ray machine used to detect drugs was out of service and a machine used to scan incoming post for drugs was not yet in operation, the watchdog found. HM Prison and Probation Service can give a jail special measures status when it has been assessed to need additional specialist support to improve to an acceptable level. HMP Lewes was put into special measures in January 2017 following a number of disturbances. 'Systemic failure' Compared with the previous inspection by HM Inspectorate of Prisons in January 2016, the prisons watchdog gave the jail lower ratings in three out of four categories - respect, purposeful activity, and rehabilitation and release planning. Referring to the fourth category, safety, Mr Clarke said: ""Although performance was not so poor as to drag the assessment to the lowest possible level, it was undoubtedly heading in that direction."" He said the ""deeply troubling"" findings at HMP Lewes were ""indicative of systemic failure within the prison service"". Mr Clarke said: ""This report brings into question the utility of 'special measures', if a prison can decline so badly when supposedly benefitting from them."" Phil Copple, the HM Prison and Probation Service's director general of prisons, said special measures had ""successfully supported improvement at other prisons"". He said: ""Although there has been progress in some areas, it has not been as swift or as comprehensive as we would have hoped.""","A prison's worsening performance since being placed in special measures has been described as ""deeply troubling""."

"By Martin BarberBBC News Online, Norfolk The nurse helped more than 200 allied soldiers to escape from German-occupied Belgium before being shot by firing squad in 1915. The six place settings of dinner plates, side plates, soup bowls, a teapot and sugar bowl were found during an attic clearance in Norwich and gifted to the Cavell Nurses Trust. Produced under the Steelite mark, Royal Doulton's hotel range, the collection carries three hallmarks which Staffordshire ceramics experts dated to between 1968 and post-1983. It is not known why the pieces were commissioned. Joe Perry, researcher at the Stoke-on-Trent Potteries Museum, said: ""The hallmarks throw up a strange range of dates. ""Our best guess would be the set was made near or after 1983, but utilised some pieces that had been manufactured prior to this but had yet to be decorated. ""The closest significant anniversary to Cavell's death would be 1985 marking 70 years - so the commemoration of Edith Cavell would seem the most likely reason for their production."" Edith Cavell, born at Swardeston, near Norwich, worked as a nurse at the Berkendael Institute in Brussels during World War I. Arrested in August 1915 for helping allied soldiers, she was executed within hours of her October trial. Her body was exhumed from her execution site in 1919 and given a military escort to Dover and then on to Westminster Abbey for a memorial ceremony. She was finally laid to rest in the grounds of Norwich Cathedral. Alison Bradbury, of Steelite International, said the pattern on the pieces was produced by a Murray Curvex printing machine ""but has not been manufactured in red and brown for the hospitality industry since the early 1980s"". ""The badge looks like it was put on by a third party decorator,"" she added. Ceramic credentials Nick Miller, keeper of Cavell memorabilia for St Mary's Church, Swardeston, said: ""I was hoping there might be some more detail showing on the plates and other items referring to Edith - as it is, it only has a head and shoulders picture of a woman and the word Norwich. ""That said, I have no doubt it is in memory of Edith Cavell, given the likeness of the portrait."" A variety of memorabilia was produced following Cavell's death. Some raised money for the Cavell Rest Homes for Nurses, others were purely commercial items similar to those produced to commemorate a royal wedding. Despite the likeness to the wartime heroine, Norwich Museum's curator of decorative art has questioned the service's Cavell credentials. ""This picture has the wrong style of cap, it looks as if she is wearing lipstick and is slightly soft and feminine, almost as if she's out of a fashion plate,"" said Francesca Vanke. ""It may be the context at the time explained everything - if the pottery was made for a Cavell 70th anniversary party in the [Norwich] Edith Cavell pub, for instance - it wouldn't need to look like her, as everyone would know who it was meant to be. ""The other possibility, and one I think quite likely, is that this is not connected with Edith at all, but was the logo of a Norwich restaurant or hotel or similar."" It seems the exact origins of the crockery will be never be known as no records appear to exist as to the ""third-party decorator"". Mr Miller said the collection will stay in Swardeston among the Edith Cavell memorabilia held in the village, with the hope of putting some of the items on permanent display in the village for the 2015 centenary of her execution.",Experts say they are mystified about the origins of a rare Royal Doulton pottery service discovered in a Norfolk attic and believed to honour the memory of executed wartime nurse Edith Cavell.
"Dr Willie Stewart carried out a new examination of the former West Bromwich Albion forward's brain. He said Astle, who died, aged 59, in 2002, was killed by chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). He said this had been caused by heading footballs. Dr Stewart said CTE was formerly known as dementia pugilistica - a progressive degeneration of the the brain caused by repeated head trauma. He said the condition was frequently mistaken for dementia, as happened to Astle when he was incorrectly diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Dr Stewart said he believed a number of footballers could be affected by CTE. ""Jeff's case is not unique. In football there will be more and what will be happening is that this diagnosis in football may be seen as unusual,"" he said. ""This is the first case that we know of."" The condition can only be definitively diagnosed after death. Mr Astle's family, who live in Derbyshire, have campaigned for the FA to carry out research into the risks of headers. It has previously apologised for not keeping the family informed about its work. Mr Astle's daughter Dawn said the family had always believed heading balls had caused her father's death but it had still been ""shocking"" to hear the results of the new tests. ""When the doctor explained he said to mum if he hadn't known he was looking at the brain of a 59-year-old man he would have thought it belonged to an 89-year-old,"" she added. ""That was the extent of the damage."" An FA spokesman said its rules on concussion are due to be changed ahead of the 2014/15 season. It was initially believed Mr Astle died from Alzheimer's disease, but the coroner at his inquest ruled his brain had been damaged by heading heavy leather balls. He played for West Bromwich Albion from 1964-1974. He scored 137 goals in 292 league appearances for the club and is recognised as one of its greatest players.","Ex-England striker Jeff Astle died from a brain condition normally linked to boxers rather than Alzheimer's disease as previously thought, a neurosurgeon has claimed."

"The 21 doctors, led by Dr Sarah Hallett, said Royal Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust breached their employment contracts. Dr Hallett told the High Court the method used to monitor shift patterns returned ""skewed"" results. But the judge, Mrs Justice Simler, ruled the trust had acted ""responsibly"" and encouraged staff to take breaks. The British Medical Association (BMA) said it is looking to appeal. ""[We] supported this test case to clarify whether trusts breached employment contracts by incorrectly applying monitoring rules,"" a spokesman said. ""We believe this led to junior doctors' rotas being incorrectly assessed, potentially compromising patient safety and doctors' welfare. ""It is deeply disappointing that the High Court does not agree with our concerns."" The court heard the staff should get a half-hour break for every four hours they are continuously on duty or be paid double for the time. Dr Hallett said the method used by the trust to monitor shift patterns returned ""skewed"" results, with one monitoring exercise failing to meet the compliance threshold. John Cavanagh QC, representing Dr Hallett, said junior doctors' rest breaks was an issue of ""general public importance"". NHS lawyers said the claim could have cost the trust Â£250,000 and open up similar claims from junior doctors across England. Mrs Justice Simler ruled that the trust had ""responsibly"" emailed junior doctors to emphasise the importance of taking natural breaks. In a statement the trust said it is ""proud"" of its record as a teaching hospital, adding the welfare of its staff ""is a major concern for us"". ""Today's judgement confirms our belief that we, in line with many other hospitals across England who use this software, were monitoring rotas correctly,"" they said.",Junior doctors who said a hospital trust failed to make sure they took proper breaks have lost a court case.
"Many places were left under water two days ago and up to 50mm (2in) is expected to fall in the coming hours. The Environment Agency has issued a flood warning for Lower Dee river, which stretches from Wrexham to Chester and Connah's Quay. Other parts of Wales are not expected to be as badly affected. The agency has also issued 20 flood alerts for Wales. BBC Wales weather presenter Sue Charles said: ""Where the south of Wales bore the brunt of yesterday's rain, the heaviest tonight and tomorrow is likely to be across north Wales, with totals of 50mm possible by Monday afternoon. ""Obviously, not welcome news, as it falls on already saturated ground and into swollen rivers."" And Deiniol Tegid from Environment Agency Wales said they were ""very concerned"" about north Wales. ""This rain will be falling on saturated ground, the rivers are already very high and any further rain will exacerbate the problem,"" he said. Mr Tegid also added: ""The main advice is to please keep clear of any flood water as it's very dangerous."" About 30mm rain fell across Wales on Saturday and after a brief lull on Sunday morning, more arrived in the afternoon and is forecast into Monday. Clean-up continuing On Saturday, the agency said heavy rain in south and west Wales could make road conditions hazardous and warned that river levels could rise. But emergency services said there had not been many reports of problems overnight, with a few houses and roads in south Wales affected by flooding. However a forecast of more persistent wet weather for Sunday afternoon and Monday has led to warnings of more disruption for areas already affected by flooding. It follows high winds and heavy rain on Thursday which left homes and businesses flooded, particularly in north west Wales. Motorists were also badly affected and traffic was brought to a standstill as the A55 near Bangor closed. The clean-up is continuing and Gwynedd council has put its gritting team on standby.

It also wants to add an extra carriage to London Overground trains and bring in the first driverless Tube trains in 2022 on the Piccadilly Line. Funding for the initiatives would come from the government and annual above-inflation public transport fare rises. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said transport initiatives in the draft Business Plan would be used to spearhead the drive for new jobs and economic growth in the capital. He said it outlined how a ""steady and sustainable stream of funding"" from the government would deliver vital new upgrades and improvements to London's transport network. 'Londoners are struggling' Part of the funding is already in place until the end of 2014/15 but the mayor's office needs to secure an average of Â£1.8bn per year from the government thereafter to fund the plans. But Labour London Assembly Transport spokesperson Val Shawcross said: ""Londoners are now facing another 10 years of above-inflation fare rises. ""We have already seen fares go up above inflation for the last five years. The mayor needs to realise that Londoners are struggling, it is time he reined these inflation-busting fares in.""

"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out details of how employers will be asked to help pay the wages of workers on the scheme. Employers will have to start making ""modest contributions"" from August, increasing in September and October. That could harm NI's hospitality and retail sector, Diane Dodds said. The job retention scheme has allowed employers to temporarily lay off staff while the government pays 80% of their salaries up to Â£2,500 a month during the crisis. The chancellor had previously extended the scheme until October. In August, employers will pay national insurance contributions and pension contributions, in September they will start to pay 10% of their workers' salaries, to make up a total of 80%. This salary contribution will rise to 20% in October. Mr Sunak said: ""As we begin to re-open our country and kickstart our economy, these schemes will adjust to ensure those who are able to work can do so, while remaining amongst the most generous in the world."" In Northern Ireland, the Department for Economy estimates 200,000 people could be on the scheme, out of 8.4 million workers covered across the UK. Speaking at the executive's daily press conference on Friday, Mrs Dodds said she had spoken to many businesses across Northern Ireland that indicated how reliant they were on the scheme, in order to continue operating. Asking firms to contribute more towards their employees' wages would be ""incredibly difficult"" in some sectors, which are already uncertain about when they can reopen or function fully. The NI Executive has called for greater flexibility around the scheme too, added the minister. Finance Minister Conor Murphy described Mr Sunak's announcement as coming too early in the attempted economic recovery from the pandemic. ""While I welcome the extension of the self-employment scheme the tapering of the job retention scheme from August is premature,"" he said. ""I am concerned it could lead to redundancies, particularly in the hardest hit industries such as hospitality, retail and leisure. ""I will be raising these issues with Treasury and stressing the need to protect jobs and livelihoods."" Last week, First Minister Arlene Foster said she had ""real concerns"" about what will happen to some workers in NI when the scheme ends. Mrs Dodds also said she understood the concerns of hotels in Northern Ireland, who have been advised they can provisionally begin to take bookings again from 8 June - but have not been provided with a date for when they can actually reopen. Ministers to review hotels timetable ""I understand the need for an indicative date for when they can open, I have raised concerns that our hotels are at a competitive disadvantage to the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain, who have already started to take bookings,"" she said. ""Ministers have agreed to give this matter further consideration and provide a further update next week."" She said it would also apply to touring caravan sites and bed and breakfast accommodation. The minister also repeated the executive's new public messaging relating to the response against coronavirus - shifting away from ""stay at home"". She said it would focus on two themes from now on: ""Stay safe, save lives, and work safe, save lives."" People should still continue to work from home where they can, added Mrs Dodds.","Changes to the government's furlough scheme could be ""incredibly difficult"" for some NI firms, the economy minister has warned."
"After second preference votes were taken into account, Mr Hogg was elected with 35.24% of the final vote His nearest rival of the nine other candidates standing for election was Independent Brian Greenslade. Turnout in Devon and Cornwall, where 1.3m people were eligible to vote, was 15.1%, according to Cornwall Council. But speaking after his win, Mr Hogg played down the issue: ""We've been worried about the turnout but we'll take that in our stride. ""This is November. It's the first time we're doing this brand new way of managing the police in this particular policing area and across the rest of UK. I for one believe entirely in it.""

In March 2010, it had 3,500 officers, but that number is expected to drop to 2,800 by March 2015 because of spending shortfalls.

""Goodness knows what would have happened"", had he not been so ""thick-skinned"", he said. The government is giving Ofcom powers to force social media firms to act. Former Love Island presenter Caroline Flack's death has prompted widespread demands for it to become a turning point for the treatment of celebrities on social media and in the press. ""In a world where you can be anything, be kind,"" Flack wrote on Instagram in December. Mr Williams - who spent less than three days in the Love Island villa - echoed Flack's words: ""We just need to be a bit kinder to each other.

"Chris JacksonPresenter, Inside Out, North East & Cumbria It was created out of a hotchpotch of former constabularies which in turn can trace their heritage back to local town law enforcement agencies - such as that of Middlesbrough, which back in 1853 only had a handful of constables to keep the place in order. What marks Cleveland out is the number of recent scandals including allegations of corruption. Few forces can boast of having their own Chief and Deputy Chief Constable arrested and sacked. Subsequent investigations also seem to be dogged with delays and escalating costs. On Inside Out (Monday, 21 October 2013 at 19:30 BST on BBC One in the North East & Cumbria) we can reveal the findings of the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation called Operation Pomeroy. It's scathing about how police handled a kidnap investigation. It found ""a host of investigative failures"", ""mistakes, incompetence and alleged dishonesty"" and ""some of the basic principles of investigationâ¦ were flawed"". The report which goes back to events that started a decade ago also looked into how police then erroneously targeted the solicitor for one defendant by arresting him for perverting the course of justice. James Watson received half a million pounds in compensation for what he was put through. Taken on top of the ongoing Operation Sacristy, which has cost Â£4m already, and Operation Lancet that racked up Â£7m without any real conclusive outcome, the good people of Teesside have seen an awful lot of time and effort spent investigating their police officers compared to crime out on the street.

"The Pagan Federation says it wants the same recognition as other faiths. Secularists say the optional question about what religion people are could lead to artificially large numbers identifying themselves as Christian. That in turn could lead to an over-provision of faith schools, the British Humanist Association argues. Jedi Knights In the 2001 Census, more than 70% of people described themselves as Christian. The Pagan Federation insists druids, wiccans, witches and other pagans constitute a serious and growing religious group. Ten years ago 42,000 people declared themselves as Pagans - the seventh highest number for any UK religion - but some experts believe the true figure was nearer 250,000 - and is significantly higher now. BBC Religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said the 42,000 figure was still only a fraction of those describing themselves as Jedi Knights. Pagans do not worship one single god, but look for the spiritual in nature. Some groups concentrate on specific traditions, practices or elements such as ecology, witchcraft, Celtic traditions or certain gods. Wiccans, druids, shamans, sacred ecologists, odinists and heathens all make up parts of the Pagan community. In October, the Charities Commission granted the Druid Network official status as a religion.",Pagans are campaigning for druids and witches to declare their religious affiliation in next month's Census to gain greater recognition for the group.
"By Steffan MessengerBBC News Friends of the Earth Cymru (FOEC) also wants to see an end to subsidised flights between Cardiff and Anglesey. The charity's Climate Action Plan said the Welsh government must outline steps for ""much deeper and faster"" cuts to greenhouse gas emissions. The Welsh government said it welcomed the report. FOEC said the Welsh government's plans were not consistent with its goal for a ""globally responsible Wales"". The charity's report, seen exclusively by BBC Wales, said ministers should set out to achieve effectively a 100% cut in climate warming gases - known as a net zero target - well before 2045. Currently, the Welsh government's goal is for a 95% reduction by 2050. This is based on advice from the independent Committee on Climate Change, which said it would be an appropriate contribution to the UK as a whole reaching net zero by the same year. But the charity said it wanted to see a more precautionary approach to minimise the risk of continued global warming. A tougher target would also take into account the UK's historical emissions and be fairer to poorer countries whose economies are still developing, it said. To achieve the goal, it wants the government to set a rule for it not to invest in or give permission for any high carbon infrastructure such as new roads, gas power plants or incinerators. The use of fossil fuel energy should be banned with immediate effect for all new homes and public bodies told to divest their pension schemes from firms involved in coal, oil and gas. The report also suggested the financial support given to provide north-south flights within Wales is ""clearly out of step with climate change goals"". It wants to see funding to prepare for the effects of climate change - such as flooding - targeted at deprived communities. Adequate green space should also be provided within five minutes walking distance of every home - with car parks repurposed and roads closed to achieve this. It also wants to see Wales follow New Zealand in stopping using gross domestic product (GDP) growth to measure the performance of the country's economy. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced over a period of time, but the report said this was an ""extremely poor measure of success"" as it can result in polluting the environment and fails to take into account the contribution of unpaid workers, often women caring for others. Haf Elgar, FOEC director, said: ""Wales is at a critical crossroads in its history and needs to address multiple emergencies right now - Covid-19 recovery, the climate and ecological emergencies and ongoing inequalities in our nation. ""We urgently need to set targets that are in line with the international Paris agreement so that we don't go over 1.5 degrees of global warming. ""Wales has historically been a big polluter and produced a lot of emissions and we need to do our fair share now and reduce our emissions very quickly."" Neil Lewis, manager of social enterprise Carmarthenshire Energy, which helps develop community energy projects, agreed with the report's recommendations and said the threat posed by climate change ""keeps me up at night"". ""The changes we've made over last 10 years are too little, too slow and we really need to act much quicker and in a much more streamlined, effective way,"" he added. He claimed part of the problem was Wales having limited powers over energy, which curtails the Welsh government's ability to take significant action. But Stuart Cole, emeritus professor of transport at the University of South Wales, said some of the report's proposals went too far: ""Underlying any economy is a very efficient transport system and unfortunately that does have some environmental disadvantages from time to time. ""But I think we've seen a reasonable balance with the Welsh government in cancelling the M4 relief road which was going to be an environment disaster in the Gwent Levels, and spending Â£800m on a new electrified train services from the valleys into Cardiff."" A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We have recently published our engagement plan inviting citizens and organisations to shape the next all-Wales plan for reducing Wales' emissions. ""Over the next year we will be consulting on specific policy areas such as transport, buildings, agriculture, air quality, and managing water resources to ensure that policy is aligned with the pathway to achieving net zero emissions and restoring the health of Wales' natural environment."" Analysis by Sarah Dickins, BBC Wales economics correspondent Friends of the Earth Cymru argues that as we try to rebuild from Covid-19 we should not prioritise economic growth - as measured by GDP - but rather things that matter to people such as health, well-being and communities. They point to New Zealand which prioritises how the economy affects jobs but also health, environment and civic engagement. Amsterdam is also moving away from GDP to measure economic success and has set a target to increasing healthy life expectancy by two years by 2025. Here in Wales there is a debate about whether pure GDP growth fits our needs now. The prime minister has called for a green and fair recovery... as Friends of the Earth is now. The drive for economic growth is based on everyone producing and consuming more. Products, from washing machines to mobile phones, have been designed to be used and then replaced by newer, ""better "" models. That has kept the economy growing but it has come at a cost to the planet and grown inequality. Wales has seen its GDP steadily fall in relation to the UK as a whole, what is interesting is that Friends of the Earth Cymru's plan is not very different from the strategies of some of the biggest businesses in the world - Unilever to name just one.","A ban on new roads, gas power plants and incinerators is needed if Wales is to play a leading role in tackling climate change, a report has said."

"David White revealed the details at a standards hearing which found that Tory leader Derrick Murphy had brought his office into disrepute. Labour group leader George Nobbs called for Mr White to step down. But Lib Dem leader Mike Brindle said Mr White, due to retire in April, should stay until a successor is appointed. Bill Borrett, acting leader of Norfolk County Council, said in a statement: ""We heard during the standards committee hearing from the chief executive that when he recorded his telephone conversation with the former leader, he acted not in his own interest, but in the interest of the authority and its public reputation. ""After much careful consideration we do not believe that action concerning the chief executive is necessary."" Mr White said he did not wish to add to the statement. The standards hearing, held on Friday, was investigating the sending of an email which allegedly disparaged Nick Daubney, the Tory leader of West Norfolk Council. Leader stepped down It heard that Mr Murphy had told council officer Kevin Vaughan to send the email. Mr Vaughan said he was asked to blame other councillors for the communication. Following the hearing, Mr Murphy said it would be ""incompatible"" for him to be leader while he pursued ""issues"" with the county council. Mr Nobbs told the BBC: ""Once that element of trust has gone it is impossible to continue discharging one's duty as a chief executive. ""Quite frankly I am horrified and appalled any conversation could be secretly recorded."" But leader of the Greens, Richard Bearman, said the chief executive should not be forced out because the council needed stability. ""[Mr White] has been chief executive for 19 years... alongside eight leaders of the council - and Derrick is the only leader, in fact only politician, he has recorded - giving him experience of working with them,"" he said. Mr Brindle said: ""We have just lost our political leader and there is no deputy to David White and he is a very experienced man. We are in the process of appointing a successor to David White, we need someone steering the ship at the moment."" Mr White, who is paid Â£205,322 a year and joined the council in October 2006, announced last year he was to leave the council in April 2013. He told the hearing Mr Murphy had been ""evasive"" in his dealings with him.",The chief executive of Norfolk County Council has been called on to leave immediately after he admitted recording conversations with a former leader.

He died three weeks later in hospital from his injuries. During the trial, the court heard O'Hara had drunk about 10 pints and had been involved in an earlier scuffle with Mr Faisal inside the bar. 'Sickening thud' He claimed he had acted in self-defence, but Judge David Hatton said: ""What he had in mind was demonstrated by the fact that before the assault O'Hara said 'if he doesn't move away it won't end well for him'.""

The installation comprises 6ft (1.8m) aluminium statues of Tommies, designed by artist Martin Barraud. Smaller versions will then go on sale with the proceeds going to armed forces and mental health charities. Dr Gerard Oram, director of the War and Society Programmes at Swansea University, said: ""The contribution that miners made to the war effort cannot be understated. ""Their unique skills made them indispensable, but this came at a severe cost.

"By Jonathan MorrisBBC News, Plymouth Tom Buckley says the River Otter in Devon can rise by more than 1m (3ft) overnight after heavy rainfall. And he wants the Department for Environment (Defra) to drop plans to rehome the six beavers. Defra, which thinks the beavers could be carrying a disease dangerous to humans, said it would not trap in flood-prone areas. Retired environmental scientist Mr Buckley has written to Defra minister Lord de Mauley saying a trapping licence application by Defra to Natural England did not consider a swift rise of the river. He told BBC News: ""Defra has carried out no assessment of where they are going to put the traps and how the location could be affected by rising water levels. ""So there are no measures that have been taken to make sure the beavers don't drown."" Devon-based ecologist and beaver expert Derek Gow said: ""The river rises very swiftly at this time of year and is one of the problems with trapping animals. ""Young beavers rely on their social units and if the adults are trapped the young ones could die of starvation and hypothermia."" It is unclear where the beavers, including three juveniles, came from, but it is believed they are the only wild beavers in England. Mr Buckley said the beavers had made homes in the riverbank and had felled a ""small number"" of willow trees which they feed on. Defra said the beavers may have tapeworm, which can cause serious disease in humans. It admitted that its trapping agency, the National Wildlife Management Centre, does not have experience of catching beavers, but it had consulted with the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland which had direct experience of beaver trapping. A spokeswoman said: ""Traps will only be placed in locations which are not at risk from flooding. ""All decisions will be taken with the beavers welfare firmly in mind.""",A former scientist fears wild beavers could drown by a fast-rising river if they are trapped by officials.
"He said if the crisis was not resolved by September, Stormont's government would be ""hanging by a thread"". The Sinn FÃ©in MLA has faced criticism from unionists for meeting US officials instead of holding more talks at home. But said he would not have been invited to US meetings if White House officials believed the talks were pointless. During his trip, Northern Ireland's deputy first minister has met representatives from the US State Department and influential Irish Americans, asking them to lobby the British government to give more financial support to Stormont. His trip has coincided with a diplomatic visit to the US by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, who has said a budget increase is not an option. On Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Minister, Arlene Foster, described Mr McGuinness' US mission as a ""waste of time"". However, he disagreed and said he had ""come away very encouraged"" by what he had heard from Barack Obama's administration. ""The fact is Theresa Villiers is here as well. Does Arlene consider that Theresa Villiers' trip is a waste of time?"" Mr McGuinness said. ""Certainly the White House [staff] don't think it's a waste of time. I wouldn't have been invited to meet with a key official if that had been the case."" The Sinn FÃ©in MLA said he was ""working flat out"" to achieve a resolution to the welfare reform crisis that has engulfed Northern Ireland's political institutions for months. He said he had made the US government aware of the seriousness of the crisis threatening Stormont's future and the likely timescale. ""The institutions, if we don't resolve this problem by September, are effectively hanging by a thread,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster. Mr McGuinness said the money required to resolve the welfare budget row was a ""drop in the ocean"" compared to the resources that British governments had spent ""pacifying"" Northern Ireland during the Troubles.",Martin McGuinness has denied that his three-day visit to the United States for talks about the Stormont budget crisis has been a waste of time.
"By Phil KempBBC News The government says the masks, which use ear-loop fastenings rather than head loops, may not fit tightly enough. They were bought for NHS England healthcare workers from supplier Ayanda Capital as part of a Â£252m contract. Ayanda says the masks met the specifications No 10 had set out. The PM said he was ""disappointed"" that any protective kit should be unfit for use. An earlier government statement said its safety standards process is ""robust"". Tim Horlick, chief executive of Ayanda Capital, insisted the masks were ""not unusable or unsafe"" and had met all government standards, adding that No 10 had ""not wasted any money"" in buying them. It has emerged that the person who originally approached the government about the deal was a government trade adviser who also advises the board of Ayanda. But the adviser told the BBC his position played no part in the awarding of the contract. Asked about the masks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very disappointed"" that ""any consignment"" of personal protective equipment (PPE) ""should turn out not to be fit for purpose"". Mr Johnson insisted the government had ""achieved a colossal race against time"" to produce ""billions of items"" of PPE and source them from abroad, adding that supplies are now being stockpiled in the event of a second wave later in the year. In the early weeks of the pandemic the NHS experienced severe shortages of PPE. The government says it had to find new suppliers quickly to meet demand and to compete with rising global competition. The procurement of PPE is devolved across the four nations of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Welsh and Scottish governments said they have not used Ayanda as a supplier. On 29 April the Department of Health and Social Care signed the Â£252m contract with Ayanda Capital Limited to supply two types of face masks. The most expensive part of the order consisted of 50 million FFP2 respirator masks, which are designed to protect healthcare workers from inhaling harmful particles. According to legal papers seen by the BBC, the government says these masks will now not be used in the NHS because of a safety concern about whether they would fit adequately. To be effective these types of face mask need to fit tightly to create a seal between the mask and the wearer's face. Anyone who wears them for work is required to undergo a face-fit test. Alan Murray, chief executive of the British Safety Industry Federation, said products with ear loops fail this test more often than those with head harnesses. It is not clear what will happen now to the 50 million masks. Ayanda Capital also supplied 150 million Type IIR masks, which the government says are unaffected. Most have now been delivered but they have not yet been released for use in the NHS and are awaiting further testing. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""For months, we were told that the government was purchasing the right equipment for the front line. Yet again it hasn't happened. Calling for an inquiry into ""what went wrong"", Sir Keir said the situation was ""just not good enough"" for the NHS workers who needed the protective kit. 'Staggering' amounts spent The information was disclosed in a legal response to the Good Law Project, which is seeking to challenge the government in the courts over three PPE contracts it awarded, including Ayanda Capital's. The campaign group argues the government's awarding of contracts directly to companies during the pandemic, rather than opening them to competition, may have been unlawful. Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project's director, said it was ""important"" for a court to examine the contracts to ensure ""full transparency of how these staggering amounts of public money have been spent"". One procurement expert described the scramble for PPE at the height of the supply crisis as ""like the wild west"". Every leading healthcare system was pressing to secure scarce supplies in the global market as coronavirus infections soared. With fears that PPE might run out at some hospitals, the UK authorities looked everywhere for readily available masks, gowns and visors. A Turkish consignment was found wanting in May and now details of contracts with little known companies signed by the Department of Health in England have emerged. It is understandable that officials facing an unprecedented shortage of vital equipment followed up any offer that looked credible. But the government has to be held accountable for the spending of taxpayers' money and the Good Law project has highlighted deals that raise questions about due process and transparency. Government adviser The government has also disclosed that the original approach to sell the masks came not from Ayanda Capital but from a businessman called Andrew Mills. His company, Prospermill, had secured the rights to the full production capacity of a large factory in China to produce masks and was able to offer a large quantity almost immediately. But the legal document seen by the BBC notes that Mr Mills requested the government instead sign the contract for the masks with Ayanda Capital, whose board he advises, because it could arrange overseas payment more quickly. What do I need to know about the coronavirus? Mr Mills is also an adviser to the UK Board of Trade. He told the BBC his position played no part in the award of the contract, which was subject to the same evaluation as all offers made in response to the government's request for help. A statement from Ayanda Capital Limited said the masks went through a ""rigorous technical assurance programme"" and could have been rejected through provisions in its contract had they not met government specifications - but those provisions were not activated. 'Worthless' certificates Another government contract the Good Law Project is seeking to challenge in the courts is a Â£32m deal with Crisp Websites Limited, trading as Pestfix, to supply isolation suits. In July, No 10 disclosed that none of the suits Pestfix supplied had yet been delivered into the NHS - and instead they were being stored in a Department of Health facility in Daventry awaiting tests. Now the BBC has discovered the pest control company has separately sold respirator masks to commercial clients using certificates from ECM, a test house in Italy which says it is not a notified body for PPE. The British Safety Industry Federation said some companies had been presenting so-called 'voluntary certificates of compliance' from ECM but they added these had ""no value and no standing"" in demonstrating an item of PPE complied with legislation. Pestfix told the BBC they ""unreservedly apologise"" for the compliance issue with certain PPE face masks they had supplied to commercial and private clients. It said it is conducting a ""thorough investigation"" and talking to regulators and affected customers. The government said in its legal response to the Good law Project that Pestfix provided certificates confirming the suits conformed to the technical standards and they were approved accordingly.",Fifty million face masks bought by the UK government in April will not be used in the NHS because of safety concerns.
"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor The Brexit secretary said there would also have to be a ""regulatory arrangement"" on agriculture and food. That refers to the EU's strict rules on food and animal imports from ""third countries"". Those are effectively countries that are outside the single market. The rules mean that consignments of food or animals can only enter the EU through specified border inspection posts. Those involve mandatory document checks and a significant proportion of consignments must also be physically checked. The details can be found on page 81 of this manual produced by the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Soothing words The UK will become a third country after Brexit and without a specific deal on food and agriculture that would mean inspections at the border. That would be hugely disruptive to the many cross-border supply chains and would also necessitate a significant amount of new infrastructure. It would be very far from the ambition of maintaining an invisible Irish border. There were soothing words from the head of the Swiss customs service this week when he gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee. Dr Christian Bock drew on his experience to map out a way to an invisible border in Ireland. He described the need for deep co-operation between neighbouring customs authorities, inspections at premises away from the border, a trusted trader scheme and the use of number plate recognition cameras. But what he did not mention and was not asked about was the political arrangement that allows for unimpeded trade in food with the EU. 'Limited scope for influence' The Veterinary Agreement between Switzerland and the EU means that the Swiss follow EU rules on food safety and animal health almost to the letter. The details are made clear by Switzerland's Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office (FSVO). Switzerland must modify its laws in response to changes in EU legislation and must monitor third-country exports at EU-approved border inspection posts. It has only limited influence in setting the rules, as the FSVO spells out: ""Switzerland seeks to represent its position to the EU when legislation is being drafted and as scientific developments occur. ""It does this by participating in working groups and in the standing committee. ""Its scope for influence is, however, limited since Switzerland does not have voting rights."" The trade expert Samuel Lowe has pointed out that one area where the Swiss differ is they permit the importation of hormone treated beef from the United States. These imports come with strict labelling and traceability requirements and, as a result, the EU does not inspect Swiss beef exports at the border because it trusts the Swiss not to act as a backdoor into the single market. 'Unique agreement' The agriculture policy expert Prof Alan Matthews has published an useful overview of what will be required from any regulatory deal. He points to the regulatory equivalence agreement for organic products that the EU has with Chile and the United States. The EU will recognise organic certificates issued by those countries even though their organic standards are not the same as in the EU. But this is a very limited deal - the EU has only been prepared to remove the requirement for border inspection with countries that have adopted its rules. Switzerland and Norway are the most important examples. Prof Matthews has warned that the difficulties in negotiating a regulatory equivalence agreement with the UK should not be underestimated. ""It would be a unique agreement, one which the EU has not granted to any other country,"" he said. He thinks that a workable solution might involve constraining the UK's autonomy to change its regulatory standards, similar to the Swiss experience. He acknowledges that runs counter to the notion that Brexit is about the UK taking back control but without a deep regulatory agreement border checks will have to be reintroduced.","A zero-tariff trade deal between the UK and the EU will not be enough to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit, David Davis acknowledged this week."
"The egg arrived at 03:30 GMT and was spotted on the live nest-cam when the female got up to resettle. The first egg of 2014 was produced last Tuesday, with the second on Friday and the third on Sunday. The Hawk and Owl Trust said although a clutch of three to four eggs is average, another one could arrive as the falcons were an ""experienced"" pair. The current batch of eggs is expected to hatch in late April. Lin Murray, from the trust, said: ""Our pair are in the swing of it now and it would not surprise us if they had a fifth egg. ""They are an experienced, healthy pair and so another egg could appear in the next 48 hours or so. ""However, the average survival rate through to them successfully fledging the nest is two.

""So up to this point the guidance that's been issued to headmasters and principals has been look at the PHA website?"" Mr McNulty replied. ""That has been what the PHA has advised the Department of Education to do,"" Ms Scott said. However, the principal of Sperrinview Special School in Dungannon, Paula Jordan, said guidance on coronavirus had been insufficient. ""Not with the complex medical needs of our children, as some of our children are life-limiting,"" she continued. ""All of our principals are very worried about what's going to happen."" Ms Jordan claimed, for example, that one school had received conflicting advice about whether a staff member who had been in contact with someone with the virus should come to work. ""It should not be a principal's call, this is a medical issue,"" she said. Classes in sheds Sharon Tennant, principal of Sandelford Special School, expressed similar concerns. ""We have very complex children with very complex health needs, children with oxygen, children with heart and lung problems, life-limited children,"" she said. ""We need really clear guidance on what to do."" The principals also said that some special schools were holding classes in sheds and staffrooms due to increasing numbers of pupils. The number of children in Northern Ireland's 40 special schools has increased by almost 40% over the past decade. There are currently 40 special schools in Northern Ireland with 6,174 pupils, an increase from 4,443 pupils in 2009-10. Ms Jordan said some of her pupils were currently being taught in a former medical room. ""We have a class in our PE hall, which means I no longer have a PE hall so we can't provide statutory PE at this time of year,"" she said. ""We have a class in our staff room. which means that our staff are now having their tea in a corridor outside a toilet. ""We have a class in a medical room, other schools have classes in potting sheds."" More schools needed? In response, SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said children with special educational needs (SEN) had been ""absolutely failed"". ""The children of today have been treated, or have ended up, as the collateral damage for the systemic failure of EA and the department in relation to their complex needs,"" he said. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Karen Mullan said it was ""scandalous"" that some pupils were being left without PE facilities. Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said there was a ""major problem"". ""Is the education authority or education system enrolling more pupils than our special schools can effectively accommodate?"" he asked. In response, Ms Jordan said more special schools were ""probably"" needed. The EA had previously apologised for widespread failings in providing support for pupils with special educational needs. DUP MLA William Humphrey asked Kim Scott what was being done by the EA to address those shortcomings. In response, Ms Scott said that the authority had an action plan to address problems identified by its own investigation.","Advice about how the coronavirus could affect pupils with complex needs has not been good enough, a Stormont committee has heard."
"By Tim Whewell BBC Newsnight There were 42,000 incidents in England last year, according to estimates based on police figures. Official figures record the number of children absent for 24 hours, as just 930. Ofsted which oversees care home inspections is criticised for a tick-box approach but rejects this, saying it has overhauled its work. Nine men from the Rochdale area were jailed in May for grooming and abusing teenage girls, including one who had been living in a privately-owned care home. Ann Coffey, the head of the group of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Missing Children which reports on Monday, said the case should not be seen as an isolated incident. ""I think it is happening in every authority up and down the country and if authorities don't think it is happening in their area, it's not because it's not happening, it's because they don't know about it,"" she said. The report is particularly critical of the work of the inspection agency, Ofsted, which refuses to tell police the locations of children's homes - information which police say could help safeguard children. ""Under the current system you can have a situation where a sexual predator is sitting in a car outside a children's home targeting the children inside that home, a home that the police don't even know exists,"" Ms Coffey said. Ofsted says it is prohibited by law from giving police the names or addresses of care homes - but wants to see a change to make that possible. Det Insp Philip Shakesheff of West Mercia Police, deputy head of a national police group on missing people, who gave evidence to the MPs, accuses Ofsted of having a ""tick-box, sterile culture"", for failing to give sufficient weight to incidents of children going missing when it inspects homes. ""At no stage have Ofsted approached us to ask us about our concerns about any home in West Mercia. At no stage have they asked us to share with them data about any homes or the numbers of missing persons episodes that they're reporting,"" he said. A spokesperson for Ofsted told Newsnight it had overhauled its approach to inspections over the past two years. ""Inspection is the absolute opposite of a 'tick-box' exercise: It focuses on what life is like for a child in a home, on the quality of care, relationships and where necessary, control on the safety of young people in the home,"" she said. The MPs also criticise the common practice of sending children away from their homes areas to other parts of the country, where police and local authorities often know little about their background or needs. They say about one third of the 65,000 children in care in England are looked after outside the boundaries of their own local authority. Kent Police recently identified a high concentration of privately-owned children's homes in small area of Margate which also has a high concentration of former criminals including registered paedophiles, as well as high levels of drug-dealing and prostitution. Many of the children are sent to the area by London boroughs who lack local places for looked-after children. Laura Sandys, MP for Thanet South, told Newsnight it was ""staggering"" that authorities were placing children in areas where they have not done a proper assessment of child safety. ""They have been taken out of traumatic environments, difficult families and then they are placed miles and miles away from any point of reference, in an area that doesn't necessarily have the profile that you would expect a local authority to find for a child who is already traumatised,"" she said. The government has stressed that children should be looked after in their own home areas whenever possible, and expressed concern to some local authorities that this is not always happening. Watch Tim Whewell's full report on missing children in the care system on Wednesday 13 June at 22:30 BST on BBC Two, then afterwards on the BBC iPlayer andNewsnightwebsite.","The care system is failing to track missing children, leaving them vulnerable to sexual crimes, MPs warn."
"Officers went to the venue, Ariana Gardens in Margaretting, Essex, on Sunday after calls from the public. Numbers allowed at wedding ceremonies and sit-down receptions were cut from 30 to 15 in England last month. Assistant Chief Constable Andy Prophet said it was a ""blatant breach of the current restrictions"". The guests were spoken to by officers who explained the event was in breach of Covid-19 restrictions and asked to leave or face a fine. Essex Police said all guests then left and a 41-year-old man was identified as the organiser of the wedding party. He was handed the Â£10,000 fine for holding a gathering of more than 15 people in breach of coronavirus legislation. The force said he was the first person in the county receive the maximum fine, and would face court proceedings if he did not pay. Mr Prophet said: ""The legislation exists for a reason, which is to stop the spread of the virus and to protect our communities as we all work together to drive down the risk of infection."" He said police involvement in coronavirus restrictions was a ""last resort"" but would be used for those who ""flagrantly or persistently breaking the law"". ""In situations such as this, a large wedding organised with no regard for the law, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action,"" he said. The venue has been contacted for comment.

"The RNLI crew at Blyth was called just after 16:00 GMT to reports of a man stranded on the east pier near the lighthouse. Spokesman for the RNLI, Robin Palmer, said the man was cut off by huge waves and had to be led to safety. The Environment Agency has since said the evening's high tides have passed. In Newcastle, water reached the top of the temporary barrier for a short time but is now receding. Three flood warnings remain in place overnight at Seahouses, the Tynemouth area and Roker in Sunderland. Earlier in the day, snow brought problems for road users in the North East, including 50 vehicles stuck on a Tyneside slip road. Difficult driving conditions saw the vehicles become stuck off the A1 Western Bypass in Newcastle. Up to 15 vehicles were also involved in a crash on the A19 near Peterlee in County Durham. Some roads, mainly on higher routes, were also closed but there have not been any reports of injuries.",A fisherman had to be rescued by a lifeboat crew after being cut off by huge waves on a pier during the tidal surge.
"About 100 ""high value"" executives will be invited to join the new Great Club, to ensure their immigration checks are completed ""swiftly and smoothly"". They will be offered personal support in navigating the immigration system, including their own ""account manager"". But they will still have to undergo the same checks as ordinary travellers. The 12-month pilot follows criticism that curbs on immigration are deterring wealth creators from coming to the UK. The government has made it harder for migrants from outside the EU to come to the UK unless they have specific skills as well as attempting to crack down on students and family members overstaying their visas. 'Priority businesses' Home Secretary Theresa May said it would enable the UK to maintain a ""competitive visa system that can innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of business and ensure Britain succeeds in the global race"". ""We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them with a service that supports economic growth while at the same time maintains the security of our borders."" Last month, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would be simplifying its visa procedures to make it easier for Chinese visitors to enter the country. A same-day business-oriented visa service, currently in force in India, will be introduced in China and other countries. The number of countries benefiting from a priority visa service - which enables eligible applicants to have their applications fast-tracked on paying a fee - will rise from 67 to 90 by next April. Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mayor of London Boris Johnson are among those to have warned against deterring the ""brightest and the best"" from coming to the UK, amid claims that tougher requirements for foreign students to stay in the UK after graduation are putting many off from coming in the first place. And plans to impose visa restrictions on Brazilians were put on hold earlier this year amid concerns that it would damage commercial links with Brazil's fast-growing economy.","Foreign business executives with ""strong links"" to the UK will get help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme."
"The independent review also said that more frequent and direct reporting to councillors ""would have been helpful"". The cost of the project had previously been estimated at Â£45m. Procurement expert John McClelland has made a number of recommendations which will be considered by councillors. He was commissioned by councillors earlier this year to examine the reasons for the spiralling cost of the project. He was also asked to identify lessons that could be learned. His report concluded that the international benchmarking approach, which formed the basis of the original project cost estimates, was not robust enough to address the challenges associated with Japanese architect Kengo Kuma's award-winning design. The report said: ""As the detailed design process moved forward, it became apparent that the technical requirements and construction method involved would place real pressure on the budget."" Referring to the lack of reporting to councillors since 2011, Mr MClelland said: ""Although a partnership joint venture, the council carries a significant element of the risks involved in this transformational investment in the city and it is important that scrutiny and assurance arrangements are effective."" In summary, he said: ""In my opinion this project had, from the beginning, little prospect of being delivered for the original budget due to an accumulation of factors that mitigated against that outcome being achieved."" He said the fact that the below-average estimate was also expected to cater for a building built offshore added to the risk. Mr McClelland also said it was not clear if the judging panel of the winning design had access to concerns about cost estimates raised by independent professionals. As a result it may not have been possible at that stage to appreciate that the complexity of the winning design could result in significantly higher costs. Recommendations included: Mr McClelland said that since January this year, a project board had been established and regular progress reports would be submitted to the council's policy and resources committee at key stages in the development. Councillor Ken Guild, convener of the policy and resources committee, said: ""We are working with our partners and BAM Construction to ensure that this unique building helps boost the economy, cultural offer and confidence of our city.â ""Mr McClelland's expertise has helped identify a number of issues which will help us on other capital projects as well. ""Construction of the V&A Dundee is now under way and the project is proceeding successfully."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We welcome the McClelland report and the comprehensive analysis of the project it provides, as well as Dundee City Council's response to the report and the actions they are taking to address the recommendations. ""V&A Dundee will be an iconic statement at the heart of the Dundee Waterfront development. ""The signature building will create local jobs and contribute significantly to the regeneration of Dundee and its waterfront, giving the city and Scotland a world-class design museum and visitor attraction."" The outcome of the review will be considered by councillors on Monday 24 August.","A review into the Â£80m price tag of Dundee's V&A museum has concluded that the way the costs were estimated was not ""sufficiently robust"" to address the building's ""unique challenges""."
"1. Wales eyes virus 'fire-break' The Welsh Government is due to announce later if and when it'll bring in a short, nationwide lockdown. A two or three-week ""fire-break"", as it's being called, could see people once again told to stay at home, and pubs, bars, restaurants, leisure facilities and non-essential shops closed. Primary pupils would likely return after half term as planned, but secondary school students may be kept at home for longer. Northern Ireland has already imposed a circuit-breaker, including school closures. Scotland has tougher rules in place across the central belt, but schools are so far unaffected. 2. Manchester deadlock latest England, for now at least, is sticking with the regional, tiered approach and talks will continue later over the imposition of tougher rules in Greater Manchester. It's thought the chancellor may offer tens of millions of pounds in extra funding for the area to try to persuade local leaders to accept stronger controls. Ministers have warned they will impose them if necessary. Look up the regulations in your area. 3. Closing down and bouncing back Across Europe, a number of nations have strengthened their approach in response to the apparent second wave of coronavirus infections. Italy - hard hit the first time round - is the latest. Mayors will get powers to close public areas after 21:00 and tighter restrictions will be imposed on hospitality, socialising and recreation. On the other side of the world the story is quite different. China - the world's second-largest economy and the place where the pandemic began - continues to recover from its impact. Track the global spread of the virus here. 4. Energy bills help Back in March, energy firms reached a voluntary agreement to support households struggling to pay their bills during the pandemic. Now Ofgem has confirmed its plans to require them to do so this winter. Those struggling to top up prepayment meters must be offered emergency credit to stop them running out. Customers in debt must also be put on realistic and sustainable repayment plans. Energy companies have already been given the go-ahead to chase unpaid bills again - although they've been warned not to be aggressive. 5. The place in North America with no cases The official case count in Nunavut, Canada, remains zero, many months into the pandemic. How has it done that? Well, in March authorities brought in some of the strictest travel regulations in the country, barring entry to almost all non-residents. Residents returning home from elsewhere first had to spend two weeks in ""isolation hubs"" - hotels paid for by the government. Inuit, who make up over 80% of the population, are a high-risk group in general for respiratory infections, so protecting them was crucial.

"By Carys HepworthBBC News The railway line connecting north and south Wales closed in 1965, bringing with it redundancies and uncertainty. In 2016, a train journey from Aberystwyth to Carmarthen - about a 90-minute drive - would take about six hours, via Shropshire, Newport and Cardiff. But Mr Jones, from Rhydyfelin near Aberystwyth, remembers when this was certainly not the case - and he would service two daily passenger trains between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen taking home workers and dropping off farmers (and their cattle). He started in January 1956, in Hereford and then Bristol, as an engine cleaner doing his time before he could qualify as a fireman and request a placement nearer his home town. ""To get a fireman's job, it was what we called dead man's shoes, because people would get to 65 and retire and then there's a vacancy,"" he said. But Mr Jones got lucky and was able to move to Aberystwyth to work as a fireman after just four years. He stayed working there until 1965 when the line shut and, after a short stint in Wolverhampton, requested redundancy and moved back to Aberystwyth and to his wife Liz, who died 13 years ago. ""They were the best days of my working life, on the railway,"" Mr Jones said. ""Not many people had cars and there were only about three taxis, it was only buses and lorries on the roads really. ""There was a late train, a 5.30 for workers which I would be on as far as Lampeter, when the Carmarthen men would take over. ""Then there would be another at about 9.30 or 10, for the people who had been out for a drink after work - there wasn't that much else to do for entertainment back then! And I'd be back here [Aberystwyth] by about 11."" Elephant express? Mr Jones also worked on goods trains - coal wagons and petrol tankers. ""I remember one year, the circus came by rail too. ""They were staying out by Llanilar and came in by train, with all the animals, so you'd have elephants coming in by rail. They had a special train to pull them. ""We used to carry cattle for the farms too."" But while Mr Jones' memories of the railway are some of his fondest - the job came with its struggles. ""I was on runaway trains twice, which were a whisker away from disaster,"" he added. ""And coming up to Aber with the goods trains, if you had a heavy load there was a bank you wouldn't be able to pull it up. ""So the signal men would have to call to send another engine to give it a push, so you'd be stuck waiting for a second engine to arrive."" But Mr Jones said the camaraderie among the firemen, who were in charge of starting and maintaining the coal fires, was one of the best parts of the job. He remembers how the men would take in flasks of tea, snacks and meals, and heat them on the boiler pipes over the train doors. ""You could take in tins of beans and because of the pipes on the footplate above the door, you could puncture the line and put them where the hot pipes were and that was how you cooked your beans. ""And we would wash everything down and then put bacon and a couple of eggs just over the fire door and just rest it there and it would start sizzling. I can still smell it now. ""A lot of drivers who had been on since the 1920s and 30s used to bring glass bottles of tea and put them up by the pipes, I don't understand how the glass didn't burst or break but they always managed it so that it never did."" But when the line went in 1965, Mr Jones' job - and many others - went with it. He was relocated to Wolverhampton, but immediately heard rumours of plans to close the depot there. ""I was courting Liz at the time, so the pull to come back to Aber was certainly there. ""I'd been working for the 10 years on the railway, and I asked my shed master privately to be honest with me, should I take redundancy while I could? ""I was given Â£140, which was a lot of money in those days."" Mr Jones went on to do various jobs, including as a post man and delivering bread. ""I was very sad to see [the railway line] go. My 10 years there, I was much happier than in other jobs I've had over the years. ""The camaraderie was absolutely terrific. All the railway men, because of the dust, would drink to get rid of it. ""Well, saying that, we enjoyed a pint of bitter anyway, but to get rid of the dust we always called in for a couple of pints. ""Miners used to do the same back in the day and pubs waited with beer lined up for them to come off shift. ""People talk about the 'good old days' like it was all so much better then. I don't know though - maybe it really was."" Bringing back the line","Runaway trains, heating meals on the boiler pipes and pints of bitter to wash away the coal dust - you would be pressed to find a steam train worker without a story to tell. Pictured riding on the front of a train - ""you wouldn't get away with that these days"" - 77-year-old Gwyn Jones describes his years as a steam train fireman as the best of his life. And as the campaign to reinstate the Aberystwyth-Carmarthen railway line gathers pace, we look back at when it was many people's only option, as part of BBC Wales' Travel Week."
"Lorna Moore, 33, born in County Tyrone, knew Sajid Aslam, 34, was part of a network going to Syria, a jury found. Their friend, Ayman Shaukat, 27, was also convicted for his roles in helping Mr Aslam and another man to travel. Police say women were being urged to go and give birth inside IS territory. 'Psychological abuse' BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said police believe at least a dozen people from the town, including pregnant women, tried to reach Syria in 2014. Walsall to Syria: Fighters, travellers and victims? One woman in the group, a mother of two who was pregnant at the time she intended to travel, has previously pleaded guilty. Moore, a Muslim convert, had denied the terror offences, saying she had been the victim of years of psychological abuse from her husband. The court heard that Moore was brought up a Protestant in Omagh, and met her husband while studying at university in Manchester in 2000. She converted to Islam so they could marry, but the relationship later crumbled after the birth of their first two children. She asked a Muslim cleric for a divorce, but was told a ""white Muslim is not a special Muslim"" and she must take her husband back, she told the court. The couple began living separate lives under the same roof, she said. 'See you there' Mr Aslam, a supply teacher, became part of a group of men in the West Midlands who became intent on travelling to join IS, the jury heard. He left the UK in August 2014, while Moore took their children to Butlins holiday park in Skegness. He was driven to the airport by Shaukat, a convicted burglar and law degree graduate, who has also been found guilty of helping Muslim convert Alex Nash, 22, to travel to the war zone. As he crossed into Syria, Mr Aslam sent a triumphant coded message back to Shaukat in the form of a video link to a song called Made It, by Cash Money Heroes. Within months, Moore had booked flights to Palma, Majorca, but the prosecution said her final destination was given away in a text from Nash's wife in Turkey saying ""see you there"". In court, Moore said she would ""never"" put her children's lives in danger, insisting she had in fact been planning to take them back to her family's farm in Omagh - a claim backed up by her mother. Mr Aslam has told his family he is teaching in refugee camps in Turkey, but his sister Sarwat told jurors he had been in touch during the course of the trial to say he wanted to ""start a dialogue with police about coming home"". The BBC has contacted him via social media - but he has not responded. Jurors were also told about other members of the West Midlands group who allegedly set off for Syria between July and December 2014. The first to join IS was Muslim convert Jake Petty, 25, also known as Abu Yaqoob Britany. His mother Sue Boyce, a Christian minister, wept as she told jurors she begged him not to go, and later had to identify his body from video footage on social media after he was killed in December 2014. Petty was swiftly followed by former schoolmate Isaiah Siadatan, 24, whose pregnant wife Kerry Thomason, 24, was supposed to fly out with their two children but was stopped by police. 'Criminal and dangerous' Siadatan is believed to have been killed in the summer of 2015, although his death is unconfirmed. Thomason has previously pleaded guilty to assisting her husband in preparation of his terrorist acts. Nash, 22, and his pregnant wife Yousma Jan, 20, also attempted to travel to Syria, but were arrested by Turkish authorities and sent back to the UK. He took sole responsibility for the plan and admitted preparing acts of terrorism, while a charge against his wife was discontinued. Neither Moore nor Shaukat showed any emotion as the guilty verdicts were delivered. Judge Charles Wide granted Moore conditional bail out of ""concern"" for her children, but told her she should have ""no expectations raised"" about the likely sentence. She left the courtroom accompanied by a man who is believed to be a close relative. A date for their sentencing hearing is yet to be fixed. Afterwards, West Midlands Police's Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale said the case showed that ""whether you are a traveller and going to join"" or you someone who helps in organising, ""that's just as criminal and just as dangerous"".",A mother-of-three and trainee maths teacher from Walsall has been found guilty of failing to tell the authorities her husband was about to join the so-called Islamic State.
"Nick Hardwick, chief prisons inspector, said Yarl's Wood, in Bedfordshire, was failing vulnerable women. He said the concerns showed women, including pregnant ones, should be detained only as a last resort. A Home Office spokesman said it was ""committed to treating all detainees with dignity and respect"". Yarl's Wood holds more than 350 detainees, most of them single women, who are waiting for their immigration status to be resolved. Mr Hardwick's report suggests that conditions have worsened since inspectors last visited two years ago. More than half of the detainees who were surveyed said they felt unsafe. Mr Hardwick said that while a total of 443 women held at the centre were removed from the UK in the six months before the inspection, just over twice that number were released back to the community. Of the 99 pregnant women who were held at Yarl's Wood last year, only nine were removed. Fifteen detainees had been held for between six months and a year. Four were detained for more than a year, the longest being 17 months. Yarl's Wood: A controversial history ""When you're there, there's no light in your life"" - One former detainee's story Mr Hardwick called for a ""strict time limit"" on how long anyone can be detained. ""Yarl's Wood is rightly a place of national concern. While there have been instances of unacceptable individual behaviour, most staff work hard to mitigate the worst effects of detention and women told us they appreciated this. ""These are issues that need to be addressed at a policy and strategic management level. We have raised many of the concerns in this report before. ""Decisive action is needed to ensure that women are only detained as a last resort. Other well-respected bodies have recently called for time limits on administrative detention, and the concerns we have identified provide strong support for these calls."" The Home Office has commissioned the former prisons ombudsman, Stephen Shaw, to independently review welfare in detention and he will report in the autumn. A Home Office spokesman said: ""A number of the findings in this report are extremely disappointing. Working with our partners, we want to make sure standards in the centre improve, especially regarding the provision and delivery of healthcare. ""We are committed to treating all detainees with dignity and respect. We aim to protect the health and wellbeing of those we are detaining at all times so we are pleased that this report finds that 80% of detainees surveyed said staff treated them with respect. But Emma Ginn, of charity Medical Justice, said: ""Immigration removal centres are dangerous places for many vulnerable detainees. They should be closed on health grounds while a comprehensive and independent investigation is carried out."" And Jerome Phelps, of campaign group Detention Action, said: ""It is high time for the government to step away from the routine detention of migrants, and instead to work with them to resolve their immigration cases in the community wherever possible.""","Conditions have deteriorated at an immigration removal centre to such an extent that it is a ""place of national concern"", the prisons watchdog says."
"Swansea-based Awema was wound up in February 2012 when public funding ended amid claims of financial mismanagement. Its chief executive Naz Malik was cleared of fraud in 2014 after a trial. Welsh government permanent secretary Sir Derek Jones told the public accounts committee Awema's debt was a ""substantial loss to the public purse"". He said money could be saved in future if organisations were wound up more quickly. ""All the time a liquidation or administration is going on, professional fees are being paid from what remains from the company's or charity's assets,"" Sir Derek said. ""Shortening that period of time would protect some of the money."" The Welsh government confirmed that the sum it lost with the collapse of Awema was just over Â£282,000. Analysis by Nick Servini, BBC Wales political editor This is the final chapter in the ignominious story of Awema. The reputational legacy damage for black and ethnic minority charities is still being felt in Wales by many of those running organisations now. The Â£300,000 loss is obviously significant but, in a way, the more important point is that events at the charity focused minds in improving the way that grants totalling Â£300m a year are awarded by the Welsh government.","Nearly Â£300,000 owed by a defunct race equality charity to the Welsh government has been written off, AMs have been told."
"Jaguar cars, Harris Tweed and pioneering game design will feature in the official UK exhibit. The museum will also present a specially-commissioned comic strip, currently on display outside its Dundee construction site. The five-month exhibition is expected to attract about 500,000 visitors. The international showcase is part of the Scottish government's Year of Innovation, Architecture and Design, a celebration of the nation's global contributions to architecture, design, engineering and science. 'International recognition' The museum will also present Genes in Space, a mobile game designed in a partnership between Guerilla Tea and Cancer Research UK to help gamers process complex genetic data. V&A Dundee director Philip Long said: ""Milan is one of the great design cities of the world, and the whole V&A Dundee team is thrilled to be representing the UK at the first international Milan Design Triennale in over 20 years. ""Taking such fine examples of design as Jaguar, Harris Tweed and Guerilla Tea to Milan, as well as our Adventures in Design comic strip, is major international recognition of these outstanding designers, companies and the development of V&A Dundee itself."" The Â£80.1m museum of design at Dundee Waterfront is currently under construction and is due to open in summer 2018.","Dundee's V&A Museum will represent the UK at this year's international Milan Design Triennale exhibition, which begins on Saturday."
"Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada, was killed by three men who drove into pedestrians before stabbing passers by. Her partner Tyler Ferguson told the Old Bailey inquests into the eight victims' deaths he frantically tried to revive her, despite knowing she had died. He was ""devastated and inconsolable"" after her death, he said. At the time of the attack, the couple had been visiting the UK from the Netherlands, where they lived. An eight-week inquiry into the deaths of the victims of the terror attack is in its fourth day. In a statement read to the court Mr Ferguson said he saw a man screaming as he ran down the road and heard the screeching of tyres as a ""large transit van"" approached from behind. It was ""immediately clear this was a deliberate act"", he said, recalling the wing mirror brushing past his shoulder. He heard a ""loud thud"" and then ""Chrissie was no longer next to me"", he said. He could see her arms and legs as she was ""pushed and pushed"" down the road under the van. When she was finally released, she had suffered ""devastating injuries"", he said. CCTV footage played to the court, which was described by counsel to the inquests Jonathan Hough QC as ""graphic and distressing"", showed Ms Archibald being struck by the van on the third time it mounted the curb. Mr Ferguson watched as she ""convulsed and released the physical life from her body"", but he attempted to perform CPR anyway, he said. The court heard Ms Archibald's death was almost instantaneous, although paramedics treated her for more than an hour. Mr Ferguson tried to find her engagement ring on the road but it was an ""impossible task"", he said. It was recovered later. Prior to the attack, the couple had had an ""intense conversation"" where Ms Archibald told him to make up with his father because he ""could get hit by a bus tomorrow"", Mr Ferguson said. At the inquests By Alice Evans, BBC News Court One in the Old Bailey was eerily quiet as we were shown countless CCTV angles of Ms Archibald and Mr Ferguson before and during the attack on London Bridge. Det Con Alistair Hutchison calmly guided the court through each frame - everyone knowing what the footage was leading up to. Ms Archibald could be seen chatting animatedly to her fiance as they walked together at about 22:05. Watching this footage in court, our attention was brought to one particular moment just before Ms Archibald was killed. The pair switched sides of the pavement, meaning Mr Ferguson was closer to the balustrade and Ms Archibald was closer to the road. When the van careered on to the pavement, Ms Archibald was hit and pulled under the front of the chassis. Her dress was ripped off as she was dragged across the road. Christine Delcros, who we have already heard recount being hit by the van with her fiance Xavier Thomas, was visibly distressed by this part of the footage. She held her head in her hands, her eyes fixed to the footage onscreen. A man on a double-decker bus near Ms Archibald's body attempted to film the aftermath of the attack, the vehicle's driver Anton Sobanski told the inquest. Someone told him to stop the recording, he added. Mr Sobansk, who broke down in court when he was asked to describe Ms Archibald's condition, also said he ""always felt London Bridge was vulnerable to an attack"". ""I was shocked there were no barriers on London Bridge. I thought this was weird, no barriers. I always felt that maybe a vehicle could be used to kill 100, 200, people,"" he said. The inquests were told on Wednesday Ms Archibald might still be alive if barriers had been put up following the Westminster Bridge attack, which took place two months earlier. The others who were killed in the attack were James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, French trio Xavier Thomas, 45, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Sebastien Belanger, 36, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, from Madrid, and Australians Sara Zelenak, 21, and Kirsty Boden, 28. The attackers were shot dead by police, who arrived at the scene of the attack within eight minutes. A pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey in February 2018 was told all three men had steroids in their systems when they died. The inquests continue.","The fiance of a woman killed in the London Bridge attack has described ""chaos and mayhem"" at the scene, saying it looked like a ""warzone""."

"By Angie BrownBBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that some measures could even last until 2021 as part of a phased lifting of the lockdown. The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was ""wholly unrealistic"" to expect that life would return to normal soon. Under the social distancing rule, people should stay at least 2m (6ft 6in) away from others to protect themselves from catching coronavirus or from unknowingly passing it on. Carole Fortune, 55, who runs beauty therapy business Carole's Beauty Therapy in Edinburgh said she hoped that rule could be relaxed. 'Very worried' She said: ""I was very worried when I heard the government saying the 'new norm' would involve being 2m away from people and that the restrictions would last until the end of the year."" Before the lockdown, Carole's job had often involved working 12in (30cm) from her clients' faces. ""I have spent Â£30,000 on facial and hair removal machines and I'm very worried I now won't be able to use them,"" she said. ""When I'm doing electrolysis, for example, I have to sit right next to the person's head and it's the same when I'm waxing eyebrows. ""It's impossible to work 2m apart as a beautician."" Michelle Hogg, 36, who has been a mobile hairdresser in Edinburgh for 20 years, also hopes there will be a rethink on the 2m rule. She said: ""It is totally impossible to cut anyone's hair under these restrictions as you are far too close. ""You're physically touching their head and in constant contact with them, so 100% you cannot do this job like this."" She has paid for an online course and tutor to retrain in reiki and other non-contact therapies so she can make ends meet when the lockdown is lifted. Alistair Davidson, 60, from St Andrews in Fife, is currently in Switzerland, where some restrictions are now being eased. He was able to get a haircut the day after hairdressers were allowed to reopen - and was very happy with the results. ""Only one person was allowed in at a time and the hairdresser disinfected the chair and locked the shop so nobody else could get in,"" he explained. ""She provided a mask, but said she preferred if people brought their own."" What do I need to know about the coronavirus?","Beauticians and hairdressers say they may find it ""impossible"" to do their jobs if social distancing restrictions continue for the rest of the year."
"A county council report said it needs to increase the number of good or outstanding schools from 72% to 85% and improve exam performances. The Raising The Bar programme was introduced because Suffolk was well below the national average in the performance tables. The report also cites the need to improve communications with teachers. Raising The Bar was introduced in 2012 to tackle poor performance after the local education authority was ranked in the bottom 10 for GCSE results and third bottom for primary school Key Stage 2 performance. 'No evidence' The report said the aims of Raising the Bar were widely accepted, but ""there is not sufficient buy-in to the programme... with at times strong criticism and cynicism"". Graham White, branch secretary for the National Union of Teachers in Suffolk, said: ""The council is claiming that Raising The Bar has raised standards already, but there is no evidence that the results are down to Raising the Bar. ""So there is cynicism, but it doesn't mean teachers won't engage with the programme and we have accepted many parts of it."" A Suffolk County Council spokesman said: ""The review was commissioned to take stock of what has been achieved and where we are at with this hugely complex and fast-evolving programme. ""We welcome the findings, which show that a significant amount has been achieved in the last year. We have already made changes to the work we are doing to reflect the findings."" The council's cabinet will consider the report on 10 June.","Efforts to improve standards in Suffolk schools are being hit by ""cynicism"" among some teachers, a report has said."

"The four stone sculptures have been there since the bridge across the Menai Strait first opened in 1850, but the A55 crossing was built over them. Almost 200 people have signed a petition to raise two of the limestone big cats onto the bridge. Some are concerned the bridge would not cope with moving the 80 tonne lions. Tim Snow, who started the ""Raise the Lions"" online petition, is calling on Network Rail to move the sculptures up, saying it would boost tourism. ""They are part of our local heritage,"" said Mr Snow. ""It would be great for visitors and locals alike to be greeted by these magnificent lions."" Bob Diamond, Gwynedd's former director of highways and now treasurer of the Menai Heritage centre, said the bridge would ""probably not be strong enough"" to hold cranes that would be needed to lift the big cats. ""They were actually finished in situ. If you try and take them apart to raise them you would in effect be destroying a work of art,"" he added. Mr Diamond also worries the sculptures could distract motorists if they are placed by the A55. The four lions - two on each side - are made from limestone from Penmon. They survived a fire which damaged the bridge in 1970. As the Britannia Bridge is a grade II listed structure any proposed alterations would need planning permission from the local authority, Network Rail said. A Network Rail spokesman said: ""As a publicly funded organisation committed to delivering our railway upgrade plan to provide a bigger and better railway, we would be unable to provide financial assistance but would be happy to meet with campaign members to discuss the structure and to offer any guidance we can"".","Campaigners are calling for 12 feet high lions ""hidden"" under the Britannia Bridge to be raised up to welcome visitors to Anglesey."

"The NHS blood test, available from Monday, is said to be safer and more accurate than existing screenings for Down's, Edward's and Patau's syndromes. It will be offered to women with a higher chance of identifying the syndromes in the first three months of pregnancy. But some people have raised concerns it could lead to more terminations. The Non-invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) test will be offered as an alternative to the invasive amniocentesis test currently available, which carries a small risk of miscarriage. The Welsh Government said it was expected the introduction of the new test would reduce this risk, as fewer invasive tests would be needed. The new test will not offer a complete diagnosis, as only the invasive test can confirm the syndrome, but aims to better inform women of the risks of having a child with the genetic disorder. Women who are given a positive NIPT test would not be able to opt for a termination based on that result alone. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: ""Our antenatal screening programme plays an important role in providing expectant mothers with the information and support they need throughout their pregnancy. ""I'm pleased Wales is leading the way by offering NIPT as part of our programme."" Helen Rogers, the Royal College of Midwives' director for Wales, welcomed the test. She added: ""Screening is always an individual choice for women and their partners and midwives in Wales have undergone additional training so they can share clear information on this non-invasive test with women which will support them in their decision making and to make the right choice for them."" But some campaigners, including the movement Don't Screen Us Out, are concerned the test could lead to more terminations and negatively impact the Down's syndrome community. Kate Harris, 41, from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, whose 12-year-old son James has Down's syndrome said: ""Currently, you would be told that there are all these different medical negatives [associated with Down's syndrome] that you could get and you would be advised to seek advice from professionals who ultimately do also advise in terms of termination. ""What we'd like to see is that whilst that body that advises still has a place, there is a very big gap that should be filled by people living the truth, that is living with a child with Down's syndrome, and although that can be varied as it can with any child, it's very different to actually experience, even if it is reading in black and white."" The decision to implement the new test follows expert advice from the UK National Screening Committee. Sharon Hillier, director of screening at Public Health Wales, added: ""It is important that women are supported with information about the conditions and the screening offered so they can make the right decision for them as to whether they want to accept this offer."" The test will be rolled out in England from Autumn 2018, although details on what it will look like are yet to be decided by Public Health England. What is NIPT?",Pregnant women in Wales are to become the first in the UK to receive a non-invasive test for Down's syndrome.
"The Â£22m radiotherapy centre, based at Monklands General Hospital in Airdrie, will be called the Lanarkshire Beatson.

It is expected to begin treating patients in about 18 months. Initially, the majority of patients are expected to come from Lanarkshire. However, over time, patients from other areas, including parts of Forth Valley and Glasgow, may also be treated there. 'Important step' Health Secretary Alex Neil said: ""This is an important step forward in this new Â£22m radiotherapy facility at Monklands Hospital, which will mean that more patients in the west of Scotland will be able to access the best possible treatment closer to home.

""But I want to reassure everyone that it will be going back down. I have also been in touch with Francoise [Schein], the artist, to reassure her on this point.

Footfall in the West End is currently 63% lower compared to this time last year, according to figures from the New West End Company. The government has been approached for comment. The number of people visiting the the West End increased when non-essential retail stores reopened on 15 June, but the New West End Company said there had been a plateau ""at less than half of usual levels"" since then. The group, which represents 600 retailers and landlords in Oxford Street, Bond Street, Regent Street and Mayfair, has forecast a Â£5bn drop in annual retail sales for businesses in the area. It has also warned that a third of the 150,000 employees it represents could face redundancy. Chief Executive Jace Tyrrell described the ""next couple of months"" as ""a defining moment for hundreds of West End businesses"" with research showing that people's concern about using public transport was particularly affecting the number of visitors.

"Forecasters said there is likely to be heavy and persistent rain, as well as storm force winds. The Met Office has issued a Yellow 'be aware' early warning for the wind. Days of heavy rain have already led to localised flooding. Scottish Fire and Rescue deployed eight appliances on Saturday to deal with flooding in Jedburgh in the Borders. Storm force south westerly gusts around 70mph are expected quite widely on Monday, with isolated gusts of 80mph in the exposed west, especially for the Islands and West Coast. Disruption is said to be likely and ""should be expected"". There may be restrictions on some of the main road bridges due to the wind strength. Disruptions to ferry sailings are also likely and the wind may cause some small-scale structural damage. Forecasters warned the weather will bring the threat of disruption to power supplies for some communities. Along with the wind, rain will be heavy and persistent, giving rise to the possibility of flooding. The Tayside and Central areas are most likely to see some issues. BBC Scotland weather presenter Christopher Blanchett said Christmas Eve will still be very windy but the strongest gusts will have subsided. He added: ""There could be a flake or two of snow falling on Christmas Day, but at the moment we are unlikely to see widespread lying snow.

""But I feel it's time to move on and I think it's time for Marie Stopes to get someone else in to manage the clinic and take it to new places,"" she said. ""At times it was difficult, particularly last year with the court case and the harassment, but I put that behind me and have concentrated on delivering services for women in Ireland both north and south. ""I think I've achieved a significant historical change in the perception of abortion in Northern Ireland from where the usual narrative was that abortion was illegal in Northern Ireland to now one where people understand that abortion is legal under certain circumstances. ""I think we've challenged the myths and stereotypes that are presented by those who are opposed to a woman's right to chose."" Genevieve Edwards, director of policy for Marie Stopes UK, said: ""We were so lucky to have Dawn and wish her every success in whatever she chooses to do. ""The support for the clinic since it opened in very challenging circumstances has been heartening and a source of great comfort and pride for our staff and volunteers. ""We are now actively recruiting for Dawn's successor to lead us into the next phase of the clinic's journey.""",Dawn Purvis is to step down as programme director of Northern Ireland's Marie Stopes clinic.
"The council had planned to halve their number by 57 to 29. But protesters voiced strong opposition and after holding a public consultation the authority has decided to keep the toilets open. Conwy's cabinet member for environment Mike Priestley said he does not intend to compulsorily close any of the public conveniences there. ""The review of our service was never about saving money,"" he said. ""We aimed to improve the service by spending money from closed facilities on refurbishing others. ""But during the consultation many people have said that they would rather have a basic facility than none at all."" Vandalised Over a million people - many of them tourists - use Conwy's toilets every year and an extensive public consultation, over a number of years, has taken place with much opposition to any closures. Mr Priestley announced the reprieve after consulting with the council leader, cabinet colleagues and the senior executive team. He added: ""Our budget will not extend to significant refurbishment or improvement of any of these facilities, and I must stress that if any are vandalised or damaged we may not have the funds to repair them and they may be closed until money is available. ""However, I'm still committed to working with town and community councils, local groups and businesses to look at opportunities to improve the service, whether by transferring responsibility or contribution to running costs.""",Public toilets in Conwy which were threatened with closure have been given a reprieve.
"Spitfire TE311 last took to the air in 1954 but has been rebuilt by technicians from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF). The BBMF, based at RAF Coningsby, already has six spitfires but there are only few dozen other airworthy examples in the world. Sqn Ldr Duncan Mason said the new machine was ""a dream"" to fly. TE311 is a Mk XVI with ""clipped"" wingtips, which alter the classic Spitfire silhouette. Fundraising team It was built in 1945 and was mainly used for training. The aircraft spent several years on display at RAF Tangmere and was then used as a static exhibit at many air shows, as part of the RAF Exhibition Flight. Sqn Ldr Mason said: ""It was phenomenal, the aircraft is a dream to fly, so it was a very successful flight. ""It's magical - you really have to keep pinching yourself, when you look out and see the wings and you realise you are sat in a Spitfire."" TE311 is painted as Spitfire XVI TB675 '4D-V', the aircraft of Squadron Leader Tony Reeves DFC, who was the commanding officer of No 74 Squadron in 1945. The event was attended by members of the Lincolnshire's Lancaster Association who contributed funds towards the project.",A Spitfire has flown at a Lincolnshire airbase after an 11-year restoration.
"By Jerry ChesterBBC News Thousands of acres of farmland vanished under water during the recent floods. Among them were about half of England's prime cider apple-producing orchards in Herefordshire and Somerset. Cider apple trees and floodwater do not mix, as Julian Temperley, who has 170 acres of orchards at Kingsbury Episcopi, near Martock in Somerset, knows to his cost. He said the flooding had been ""a severe problem"" and growers would not know until the spring whether their orchards had been destroyed by the winter storms. ""We've had an appalling late December, January and February - trees over the whole of the South West have taken a hammering,"" he said. ""There's certainly a big worry about waterlogged trees - there will be a considerable number dying. ""We have one orchard that's been under a foot of water... I'm not certain if the trees will survive."" Walking around the Herefordshire orchards owned by Kier Rogers it is easy to see the effects of the recent flooding. Farm tracks are pitted with suspension-threatening ruts and potholes and the earth around the trees still has a greenish tinge from the standing water. Mr Rogers' orchards are protected from the nearby River Wye by flood defences, but the recent heavy rain has brought a fresh problem. His farm lies in a loop of the river and the 10in (25cm) of rain that fell on the Midlands in January and February, according to Met Office figures, have raised the water table, saturating the soil so rainwater cannot drain away. ""We've had surface water here since the end of December when it started raining - and that causes me great concern - I don't know what the long-term effects on the trees, and the damage we will see this year,"" he said. Taking me around his orchards, he anxiously looks at the emerging buds on the trees that have been flooded. Last year he lost hundreds of trees and he must now wait to see what damage this year's deluge has done. ""They took 15 years to grow and now they get lost to saturated soils,"" he said. Rob Collins, an apple grower and horticultural contractor who helps run an apprenticeship scheme in cider growing at Herefordshire and Ludlow College's Holme Lacy Campus, explained that if the trees stand in waterlogged soil or standing water for more than 14 days it kills off the roots. ""It is the fibrous roots that can't be seen by the naked eye that are affected the worst,"" he said. ""These are the roots that do all the work and are the most vulnerable to being killed off [by water] - they need to breathe."" The time when the tree is flowering is the most ""energy sapping"", he said, and if the roots have died it ""gets so far and then can't survive"". The problem is made worse, he said, by a bacteria which thrives in standing water and is attracted to tree roots ""speeding up the dying process"". ""The thing is you don't realise it's happened until half way through the season, and with flood damage the tree will die very quickly,"" he added. This means growers whose orchards have been flooded or waterlogged face a ticking time bomb. They will not know the extent of damage until May or June, when their trees could either produce apples as normal or die virtually overnight. The National Association of Cider Makers is preparing for the worst but hoping for good news. ""Many [producers] will lose trees that will need to be replanted,"" said Paul Bartlett, its chairman. ""We hope for the best, though recognise that the potential impact could seriously affect the income of growers this season and for several years to come."" Bill Wiggin, MP for North Herefordshire, knows the importance of apple growing and cider production to his rural constituency. Herefordshire manufacturer Bulmers have 10,000 acres of orchards and 180 farmers growing apples for them on contract - 30% of the apples grown in the UK go into their cider, the company said. Mr Wiggin's call for the cider duty escalator, which automatically raises the amount of tax on the drink in the budget, to be scrapped was heeded by the Chancellor in his budget. ""With some cider makers in the West Country hit hard by the recent weather, I am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider,"" George Osborne announced. Mr Bartlett said it was ""great news"" the chancellor has recognised the impact on growers and cider makers of the winter storms and rain. ""It protects the investment [growers] have made over many years to grow the industry and support the rural community, as well as supporting thousands of jobs."" Meanwhile, as the waters recede on the Somerset levels, Mr Temperley, said cider producers had another worry - the impact of the floods on tourism. ""The cider culture of our part of England has a considerable number of small farms making cider,"" he said. ""We are affected not just by the trees dying but by people not coming to the area. ""People have to be persuaded to come back to Somerset, which they're not doing at the moment.""",One of the wettest winters in memory has flooded England's orchards and left its cider industry facing an uncertain future. Now the Chancellor has decided to freeze duty on ordinary cider to help producers. But what damage has the weather done?
"Experts believe carts, like the one in the 1903 picture, would have taken at least 12 days to grit the entire Westminster network. A picture of a diesel gritting truck used by the local authority from the 1950s was also discovered. Westminster council said it had been thought that no examples of old gritters had existed in its archives. The pictures were found last week by archiving staff in an old folder that had not been catalogued. Ed Argar, the councillor responsible for transport, said: ""When you look at these pictures you realise just how much progress technology has made in our ability to take on snow and ice."" He said the authority now had GPS-guided gritting lorries and ""an army"" of smaller trucks that doubled as street sweepers. ""The technology we now have allows us to be more precise, and almost surgical, in dealing with ice and snow on the roads and pavements,"" he said.",A rare photograph of a horse-drawn road gritting cart from nearly a century ago has emerged.
"David and Samantha Cameron's card is formal, showing the smartly dressed couple in Downing Street, flanked by Chelsea Pensioners.

"Jacqueline Wileman, 58, was struck while she was out walking in Brierley, near Barnsley, in September 2018. Sheffield Crown Court heard the lorry had been stolen by rear passenger David Mellor three days before the crash. Mr Mellor, 48, from Worsbrough Dale, and two other men deny causing Mrs Wileman's death by dangerous driving. Giving evidence, Mr Mellor said he had taken the tractor unit on 11 September as he had been ""having trouble getting his wages"" from his employer. He said he had spent the next few days at co-defendant Alan Mawhinney's house drinking and taking drugs. On the morning of 14 September, he said he woke up feeling ""drunk and groggy"" and went to sleep in the back of the vehicle. He said Mr Mawhinney, 53, and 23-year-old Karn Hill got in the vehicle later, with Hill in the driver's sear. Mr Mellor said he had ""no problem"" with Hill driving as he had seen him driving ""bigger trucks"" before. The men then drove to Grimethorpe to collect Hill's friend, Wayne Carroll, 29. Asked about witnesses who described seeing the lorry being driven badly, Mr Mellor said ""there were no manoeuvres that I was concerned about"". The court heard that as the lorry approached Brierley a police car began following it. Mr Mellor said he was aware of the vehicle and told Hill to stop but he ignored him. Moments later, the lorry lost control and struck a number of parked cars and Mrs Wileman before careering into the side of a house. Asked by his barrister Robert Woodcock QC how he felt about Mrs Wileman's death, Mr Mellor said ""it upsets me to think about it"". Mr Mellor, of Bank End Road, Mr Carroll, of Chestnut Street, Grimethorpe, and Mr Mawhinney, of Calder Crescent, Kendray, all deny causing death by dangerous driving. Mr Mellor and Mr Mawhinney have both admitted a charge of aggravated vehicle taking. Mr Carroll denies the same offence. Hill, of East View, Cudworth, has admitted causing death by dangerous driving. The trial continues.","A passenger in a stolen lorry which knocked down and killed a pedestrian said he had ""no concerns"" about the way it was driven prior to the collision."

I then saw the top of a handgun,"" the officer said. ""I was under no doubt he was holding a handgun. At this point the male quickly looked up at me then down at the handgun. He started to lift his hands. ""It is my honestly held belief that my life and that of my colleagues was in imminent danger. I fired my weapon."" The officer said he fired three shots. ""I fired a third shot as I continued to challenge him. He snapped his head up towards me, his eyes rolled into his head. I felt the immediate threat had gone.""

"By Claire Gilbody-DickersonBBC News Ms Van Der Merwe has been speaking about her fight to get treatment for a condition that causes her pain and anguish. The hairdresser, 44, says she has seen at least 10 GPs to talk about her breathlessness and accelerated heartbeat, but ""not one of them"" was able to tell her these symptoms were caused by sunken chest syndrome, also known as pectus excavatum. ""I couldn't even open a jar but they've never said 'let's investigate it'"", said the mother of one, who lives in Devon. ""It's actually me who has educated them about pectus."" Since February, the NHS in England has not offered routine surgery for those with the condition as it says there is insufficient evidence the benefits of surgical treatment warrant funding. ""There is absolutely no way I could live the way I am now because I'm being strangled inside. For them to say no is just absolutely disgusting,"" Ms Van Der Merwe said. ""I have been on antidepressants all my life since my deformities started. ""I can't do something as simple as running up the hill or stairs because with your heart pumping blood so fast it's really dangerous."" Ms Van Der Merwe, who has a nine-year-old daughter, said she should have had the surgery 10 years ago, but GPs did not heed her requests for a specialist referral. ""I've been trying to speak about my pectus to my GPs but I always feel like I get fobbed off, because no-one really has the knowledge about it."" She therefore sought out thoracic surgeon Joel Dunning, from the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough, for a specialist's insight. ""She has never known what's it's like to be normal,"" said Mr Dunning, who added there was ""no doubt"" his patient's heart is being ""squashed"" by her sternum. He said it was ""crazy"" to deny ""life-extending"" surgery in cases like hers. ""The man on the street could tell you that if you have a squashed heart because of your chest, if you take the squashing away it makes the breathing better."" Thanks to the intervention of the surgeon, Hull-born Ms Van Der Merwe, who also has Poland syndrome, is due to have a procedure to insert up to three titanium bars to raise her chest to a normal position. Mr Dunning successfully argued she needed treatment after having poor surgery in South Africa, where she moved as a child. He said the ""massive"" psychological benefits of surgery, especially for young people, should be enough for the NHS to offer surgical treatment. ""These are poor little teenagers trying to find their way in the world and they feel very introverted, they won't take their top off, they won't interact with people of the other gender."" Pectus excavatum Katie Bruce was 21 when she fainted due to her sunken chest syndrome and was hit by a car. She lost four of her front teeth and suffered multiple facial fractures. One side of her jaw snapped off her skull and ""never repaired"". The Wolverhampton-based biochemistry graduate managed to get Nuss surgery in March, a year after first applying and being rejected. Because her chest dip was so deep, surgeons were only able to insert one metal bar. It ended up flipping on its side, and the 26-year-old was left bedridden while waiting for corrective surgery. ""It just feels like I'm being repeatedly stabbed between my ribs. No painkillers can help that,"" she said. ""I am 26, I have a degree and I can't do anything. I can't get a job, I can't think of starting a mortgage for a house or starting a family. My life feels like it's on hold."" She is soon to undergo surgery to fix the flipped bar and have a second one inserted to distribute the pressure, in the hope this will reduce the pain. Ms Bruce said she would not be in the position she is in now had the operation happened 15 years ago, when her bone structure was still forming and the chances of flipping were lower. ""If they were more aware of it in the first place and I'd been treated a long time ago I would never have been hit by the car and it would have cost the NHS a hell of a lot less in the long run."" She said she too reported breathlessness and an accelerated heart rate but was not correctly diagnosed for years. ""I am shocked at the amount of GPs I've seen and none of them have known anything about it."" NHS England said in a statement that it no longer provides routine surgery for sunken chest syndrome as a ""careful review of evidence suggests limited effectiveness"". It said it ""leads the world on innovation"" and would ""continue to test the most advanced procedures available, collecting real-world evidence to ensure NHS patients receive world-class care while delivering value for the taxpayers' pound"". Meanwhile, Ms Van Der Merwe waits for the operation she hopes will make all the difference. She says she's nervous but knows she needs to have the surgery. ""I am fearful, but I know deep down it's going to save my life.""","Kerry Van Der Merwe has sunken chest syndrome, a rare medical condition that leaves her struggling to breathe. In many cases the syndrome - a malformation of the chest wall caused by the breastbone sinking inwards - is seen as a cosmetic problem that doesn't warrant publicly funded surgery."
"Eleanor Brazil has been given the role for Stoke-on-Trent, after a report in March from watchdog Ofsted said vulnerable children were ""not being protected"" by the city council. The authority has said it is taking immediate action to make improvements. A plan for getting better was ""being taken forward as a matter of urgency"", the Department for Education said. The commissioner will support the council in its improvements for a year, at which time a decision will be made on whether it needs further support. Too many children came into care in crisis, too many waited too long to be reunited with their families, there were insufficient fostering placements and social workers' caseloads were too high, the report found. The authority said in March it was making an immediate multimillion-pound investment and had appointed a new management team. At the time council leader Ann James, a City Independent, said the authority was ""very concerned by the findings"" and she would like to reassure families it had ""listened closely"" to inspectors' comments.

"A judge ruled that the Home Office policy meant people were being given ""little or no notice"" of removal and were deprived of access to justice. The policy was challenged by Medical Justice, which provides medical and legal advice to people facing removal. The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" and would appeal. Medical Justice and the Home Office each laid out their case at a hearing last month, and on Monday Mr Justice Silber ruled that the fast-track policy was ""unlawful and must be quashed"". He said those subject to a removal order must have the right to challenge it, but fast-tracking meant it was often not possible to obtain sufficient legal advice in time. He said the policy must also be considered in context - many of those affected would have little or no English, would be ""heavily stressed"" at the prospect of removal and ""desperate"" to avoid it. But Mr Justice Silber did give the Home Office permission to appeal against his decision, saying the case raised issues of general public importance, including the constitutional right of access to justice. 'Late-night swoops' Originally, the Home Office practice was to give those facing deportation 72 hours' notice of removal. But an ""exceptions policy"", introduced in March 2007 and widened in January this year, led to some removals happening much faster. At last month's hearing, Dinah Rose QC, appearing for Medical Justice, said that in some instances immigration officers arrived late at night to escort people to flights leaving only a few hours later. Home Office lawyers argued that the deportation policy was ""sufficiently flexible"" to avoid any human rights breaches, and that detainees were given as much notice as possible before removal. But BBC home affairs correspondent June Kelly said the court felt the government had failed to bring in adequate safeguards to ensure those deported at very short notice were not put at risk. Emma Ginn, from Medical Justice, said she was ""delighted"" at the court's decision. ""Quite apart from the affront to justice, the cost in human misery was a source of shame,"" she said. ""It feels like UKBA [the UK Border Agency] chanced their arm to see what they could get away with, in the knowledge that many vulnerable victims' voices would not be heard in the middle of the night."" Children But a Home Office spokesman said: ""The policy of making limited exceptions in special circumstances to 72-hour notification of immigration removal has been an important element of our management of removals. ""The government remains committed to removing individuals with no right to be in the UK as quickly as possible."" Fast-track deportation was introduced to deal with certain types of case, such as those involving unaccompanied children who could not be detained before removal and posed a risk of absconding. It was also applied to individuals thought to be at risk of suicide once given their removal instructions, and instances where reduced notice was deemed necessary ""to maintain order and discipline"" at a detention centre. Welcoming the ruling, Donna Covey, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said many people refused asylum in the UK ""have serious grounds for appeal if given the chance"".",The fast-track deportation of foreign nationals refused permission to remain in the UK has been declared unlawful by the High Court.
"On BBC Radio Manchester, Mr Miliband said Evans had shown no remorse and that he would not employ him. Oldham had been poised to offer a long-term deal to Evans, 26, who was freed from prison last October. But an online petition signed by 20,000 people opposing the deal has prompted the club to reconsider. Wales international Evans had been set to join Oldham on a long-term deal and train with the League One club on Monday. But, amid increasing concern about any criticism and the possible reaction of sponsors, the club's board held a meeting on Monday to reconsider the move. Late on Monday afternoon, Oldham's chief executive, Neil Joy, made a statement outside the ground in which he said: ""Whilst acknowledging the considerable media attention we continue to have conversations with representative bodies, such as the [Professional Footballers' Association], and will conduct due diligence with regard to any decision we make on this matter."" The club manager, Lee Johnson, earlier said it was a decision for the board, but acknowledged that the club was facing a ""very, very difficult circumstance"". Asked about the issue on Monday morning, Mr Miliband said: ""I think that it's right Oldham are thinking again about whether Ched Evans should be hired by them because you are a role model, he's been convicted of a very serious crime. ""Personally, if I was in their shoes, he hasn't shown remorse and I wouldn't take him on."" This view was echoed in a statement by Greater Manchester's Police and Crime Commissioner, Tony Lloyd, who said: ""All offenders have the right to rebuild their lives and make amends after they have served their sentence. ""But Ched Evans' lack of remorse and failure to acknowledge his offence means it is simply inappropriate for him to be on a Greater Manchester football pitch week in and week out presenting himself as some kind of role model, especially to young people."" 'Out of the door' The firm that sponsors Oldham Athletic's main stand - Verlin Rainwater Solutions - has said it will end its association with the club if Evans is taken on. Craig Verling, a director at the company, said: ""The club know our stance and that is if they sign or allow Ched Evans to train we will be out of the door."" The club also has an affiliation with the local Mecca Bingo hall, and a spokesman for Mecca Bingo said it would ""review the partnership"" if Evans was signed. However, another Oldham sponsor - Web Applications UK - said it would continue to support the club, with chief executive Craig Dean arguing that it would be ""unethical"" to seek to influence the situation in either direction. Evans was convicted in April 2012 of raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel the year before, while he was a player for Sheffield United. The club cancelled his contract, but upon his release it offered him use of their training facilities. However, the offer was withdrawn after a backlash from supporters and club patrons. Television presenter Charlie Webster, who resigned as a patron of Sheffield United over the issue, said Evans should not be able to return as a professional footballer. On ITV's Good Morning Britain on Monday, Ms Webster said that, while she did ""believe in rehabilitation"", she felt Evans should now be restricted to jobs ""where he's not influencing the next generation and he's not seen as a role model"". She said: ""The problem with giving Ched Evans his job back in a position of privilege is the fact that we're saying to young boys and men out there: 'You know what, we tolerate rape in this society. It's OK, you might get a bit of a slap, you might get two-and-a-half years in prison - but actually ultimately you'll be fine.'"" Maintaining innocence The MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, Debbie Abrahams, said in a statement: ""I believe it would be wrong for Ched Evans to return to playing football for OAFC, or any other club, as he has been convicted of rape, a violent crime for which he has neither apologised or acknowledged. ""As he is claiming his innocence, and in the process of appealing against his conviction, both he, and football clubs, should wait for the outcome of this process before even considering a return to the sport."" Maltese club Hibernians recently said they wanted to sign Evans, but the Ministry of Justice declared that the strict conditions imposed on sex offenders taking up new employment effectively prevented him working overseas. Evans maintains his innocence, and an investigation into his conviction by the Criminal Cases Review Commission is under way.","The football club Oldham Athletic are right to be reconsidering whether to sign convicted rapist Ched Evans, Labour Party leader Ed Miliband says."
"Currently, a whole-life tariff can only be given to someone aged over 21 but ministers plan to reduce this to 18 for exceptional cases, such as terrorism. A White Paper outlining further details will be published this week. But Labour said the Tories had pushed the justice system ""to the brink"". The proposals will also include whole-life sentences for those who kill children. And there would be new powers to prevent the automatic release of offenders who have become radicalised behind bars while serving non-terror related sentences. A whole-life - or so-called ""life means life"" - order means the criminal is in prison for the rest of their life without ever becoming eligible for parole. It differs from a life sentence, under which the prisoner is given a number of years they must spend in jail after which they will be eligible to apply for parole. Whole-life tariffs are reserved for offenders judged to be the most dangerous to society. The planned reforms come after Hashem Abedi, who helped his brother Salman plan the Manchester Arena bombing, was jailed in August for life and ordered to serve at least 55 years in prison. He was under the age of 21 at the time of the murders so a whole-life order was not an option open to the courts. Sentencing Abedi, Mr Justice Jeremy Baker said a whole-life order would have been a ""just sentence"" in the ""exceptional circumstances"" but said he still ""may never be released"". Writing in the Sunday Express, Boris Johnson cited Abedi's case, saying if someone plots to deliberately kill dozens of people ""then it doesn't matter if you're 'only' 18, 19 or 20 when you do so"". ""We're going to remove a loophole that lets some truly despicable criminals avoid such a sentence because they're under 21 at the time of their crime,"" Mr Johnson added. Crack down Under the proposals, there will also be longer sentences for 15 to 17-year-olds who commit murder. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said: ""From longer jail time for dangerous criminals to new measures to improve rehabilitation and cut reoffending - we are delivering a system that is more equipped than ever to crack down on crime, which the public can have confidence in to keep them safe."" But shadow justice secretary David Lammy accused the government of failures, citing a Prison Reform Trust report which stated there was a reoffending rate of 64% for those who spend fewer than 12 months in prison. And shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said increasing sentences for younger terrorist offenders was ""quite low down the list"" of issues facing the criminal justice system. Speaking on Sky's Ridge On Sunday, she added: ""The criminal justice system is in complete disarray because of years of cuts, of privatisation of the probation system and of undermining of the courts and of the police."" A White Paper is expected to be published mid-week before legislation is laid before parliament in the new year.",Teenagers convicted of murder in England and Wales could receive whole-life terms under sentencing reforms described by the government as the most radical in almost 20 years.

"By Benjamin WrightBBC News 'Can I have a 'P' please Bob?' Standing on the site of the old Arms Park, The Millennium Stadium was finished in time at the turn of century for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. While bearing the millennial name, it has seen the Welsh rugby team claim three grand slams as well as hosting Manic Street Preachers' biggest ever gig - the fittingly titled Manic Millennium. Following a 10-year naming rights deal with The Principality Building Society, it was renamed The Principality Stadium - a move not universally popular in Wales because of controversy surrounding the 'p' word. However, for the Champions League Final in 2017 - it was renamed The National Stadium of Wales for one day. Hello, is Dave there? Costing Â£27m, stadium was originally called the White Rock Stadium during construction. Then, when it first opened in 2005 the 21,000 capacity arena was briefly called New Stadium Swansea - something fans ignored altogether opting to call the ground ""Dave"" instead. A deal with property firm eventually saw it bestowed its current moniker: the Liberty Stadium. When a name kicks up a stink An idea to change the name Varteg to Y Farteg was met with raised eyebrows as well as a few sniggers. The plan was poo-pooed by residents as they feared the new name, which some said sounded like a flatulent egg, would make their Torfaen village a laughing stock. Councillors eventually agreed and wafted the name change plan away. The signs they are a changin' Cardiff International Arena opened in 1993 - and soon became known by the abbreviated form the CIA. In 2011, it was given perhaps the less snazzy title of the Motorpoint Arena - following a naming rights deal worth a reported seven-figure sum. The venue has hosted more than 3,000 events over the years - including gigs by the likes of Bob Dylan and Stereophonics as well as stand up shows from comedians such as Eddie Izzard. Chew-sing a new name Confectioners are also not immune to opting to go with a new identity. In the UK, the popular Marathon chocolate bar was renamed Snickers - which was what it has been known as in the United States since it first hit the shelves back in 1930. Another favoured sweet classic Opal Fruits also bit the dust in 1998 - relaunching as Starburst. The artist formerly known as?

"The 20 birds left Gloucestershire's Slimbridge Wetland Centre last week but 11 returned four days later. Each year Bewick's swans fly 2,485 miles (4,000 km) to the UK to avoid the harsh Russian winter. But they return to the Arctic in the early spring to breed. Their journey north at this time of year is triggered by the lengthening days in the UK and they rarely have to abort their journey - which is known as reverse migration. Kane Brides, a research officer at the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) said it was ""very sensible"" of the birds to return to avoid the storm's easterly wind direction. ""Arctic migrants like the Bewick's swan are used to chilly weather and, given the extremes of climate they experience, are very adaptable as a result,"" she said. ""However, freezing conditions reduce food availability and blizzards reduce visibility for migration."" Bewick's swans at the centre are the subject of one of the most intensive wildlife studies in the world and are identified by the unique yellow and black patterns on their beaks. The study was started by WWT founder Sir Peter Scott and has been running continuously for 50 years. During that time, it has recorded the lives of almost 10,000 swans.

"He said he did not accept that his pledge to cut immigration below 100,000 could not be achieved within the EU. In a live Q&A on Sky News, he said leaving the EU and the single market would ""trash"" the UK economy. Vote Leave's Iain Duncan Smith said the studio audience were ""fed up with the scaremongering"" of the Remain campaign. 'Right ambition' The live Q&A and questions from a studio audience on Sky News was Mr Cameron's first major TV event of the EU referendum campaign. Justice Secretary Michael Gove has admitted he is feeling ""nervous"" as he prepares to take part in a similar programme on the channel on Friday evening but says he is hoping to ""allay people's fears"" about leaving the EU. In other developments: Analysis By Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor The Q&A underlined how immigration is rapidly becoming the issue in this referendum campaign. Again and again Mr Cameron was challenged over it with members of the audience talking about ""a never-ending stream of migrants coming in"". Another woman said ""I think we're struggling, I think we're sinking"". It seemed Mr Cameron was repeatedly pushed onto the back foot, in part because of his commitment to get net migration down to tens of thousands and in part because it seemed he doesn't have an answer to the basic question of ""what do you do about free movement in the EU?"". The answer is you can't do anything if you want to remain in the single market. It was striking how often he kept extolling the virtues of the single market trying to shift the argument back onto the economy. But it was a pretty hostile audience and every time he tried to articulate an argument it was almost dismissed as scaremongering, with one audience member calling it ""classic Cameron scare tactics"". Among the first questions Mr Cameron faced from Sky's political editor Faisal Islam was one on the net number of EU migrants that have arrived in the UK since he became prime minister in 2010. Mr Cameron said about 600,000 had left this country and about 1.2 million had come to live or work here, accepting immigration was a big challenge. When told his manifesto pledge to cut net migration into the UK to the ""tens of thousands"" could not be achieved while the UK remained in the EU, Mr Cameron said: ""I don't accept that. I think it remains the right ambition for Britain."" Last month it emerged net migration to the UK hit 333,000 in 2015. A Home Affairs Committee report later said it would take a ""modern miracle"" for David Cameron to meet his ""no ifs, no buts"" pledge to cut migration to under 100,000. Mr Cameron said the UK economy had outperformed Europe but he expected immigration from and emigration to the EU to come into balance as the economies of countries such as France and Germany picked up. ""I'm not going to put a date on it,"" he said. ""There are good ways of controlling migration and there are bad ways."" He said a ""good way"" was to ensure new arrivals did not claim unemployment benefit and left after six months if they did not have a job - as he had done in his renegotiation - as well as ensuring people ""make a contribution"" for four years before getting full welfare access. He added: ""It would be madness to try to do that by trashing our economy and pulling out of the single market."" 'Drives me crazy' In a wide-ranging discussion, which included accusations from audience members of ""scaremongering"", ""hypocrisy"" and ""waffling"" by Mr Cameron, the prime minister admitted ""frustrations"" with the EU but said many had been addressed. ""Sometimes this organisation drives me crazy. But do I sit there and think Britain would be better off if we left? Are we quitters? Do we think we quit the EU, we quit the single market and somehow we will be better off? Absolutely not."" He said the EU would still exist but, if the UK backed Brexit, the UK would be left outside the negotiating room, ""our nose pressed to the window, trying to find out what decision they were making"", adding: ""That would be terrible."" But former Conservative cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said it was ""telling"" that the PM refused to set any date for cutting net migration below 100,000. ""I thought that was a telling moment because he realised it is difficult to achieve that without coming out of the EU and close our borders,"" said Mr Duncan Smith. ""All that stuff about, if we leave the EU it induces the likelihood of war, the audience laughed at that. ""I thought that was the most telling bit because they are fed up with the scaremongering. It shows the way they were going about their business was to scare people to stay in."" 'Doesn't add up' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron had constantly referred to the single market adding: ""It sounds lovely and cuddly and fluffy but actually this referendum is about political union and the single market is actually the embodiment of it. It's cost us a great deal of money to be a member of it. ""Anything to get away from immigration, anything to get away from the fact he can't control his borders and was he lying when he wrote the manifesto or is he lying now because somewhere this doesn't add up."" Mr Cameron, whose party is split on the EU, has refused to take part in any head-to-head TV debates with fellow Conservatives who back leaving the union. But cabinet minister Michael Gove will make the case for Leave and face questions in an equivalent event on Sky News on Friday. Thursday's event comes with three weeks to go before the in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership and follows the BBC's studio debate last week in Glasgow with leading campaigners for both sides. What TV debates are planned, and when? BBC: ITV Sky Channel 4","David Cameron has said migration can be managed if the UK remains inside the EU and it would be ""madness"" to try to control it by voting to leave."
"More than 1.4m people in the county will be living under tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday. The restrictions must be reviewed after 28 days but Greg Fell said he feared four weeks ""will not be long enough"". Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said restrictions will remain ""as long as they are absolutely necessary"". In Barnsley the infection rate in the seven days to 19 October was 486 cases per 100,000 people, in Sheffield 415, in Rotherham 407 and in Doncaster 393. The average area in England had 117. Mr Fell said: ""I think the numbers would have to get an awful lot lower than they are now for us to be moved back in to tier two. ""The numbers are [currently] quite high and they are going up so we've got to turn that corner and get them going back down again. ""I hope I'm wrong but I sense it will take more than a few weeks for the numbers to get down to a low level."" Julia Burrows, Director of Public Health Barnsley, said it was too soon to say when the town would be ready to move out of Tier 3, and it would ""depend on people adhering to the new guidelines"". Meanwhile, in a letter to South Yorkshire residents, Sheffield City Region Mayor, Dan Jarvis MP, urged people to ""do their bit"" and stick to the new restrictions. The tier three alert level means people cannot mix with other households, and pubs and bars will be closed - unless they are serving substantial meals. In South Yorkshire businesses such as betting shops, adult gaming centres, casinos and soft play centres must close and gym classes will not be allowed, although gyms can remain open. Households are also banned from mixing outdoors in private gardens or anywhere inside and people are advised against travelling into or out of the area. After the tighter restrictions for South Yorkshire were announced on Wednesday, Mr Jenrick said: ""The restrictions we have agreed together will only be in place for as long as they are absolutely necessary. They will be reviewed jointly in 28 days time. ""The government is totally committed to working with local leaders as we tackle this challenge, for the benefit of all the people of South Yorkshire.""","Stricter coronavirus rules are likely to remain in place in South Yorkshire for more than 28 days, according to Sheffield's director of public health."
"Some NI hauliers have used direct ferries from Rosslare to Cherbourg and a new route to Dunkirk to avoid Covid-19-related delays through Britain. France initially banned lorry drivers from entering the country from Britain before Christmas. It was to try to prevent the spread of a new variant of coronavirus. The restriction was lifted on the condition that drivers had a negative PCR or antigen Covid test taken less than 72 hours before embarking on their journey to France. The French government has now extended the travel restrictions to lorry drivers with UK passports who are resident in Britain and Northern Ireland travelling on ferries from Ireland. As first reported in The Irish Times newspaper, the Republic of Ireland's Department of Transport isssued guidance to shipping companies on Friday night. ""The French authorities are aware that a driver could hold a UK passport and still work and live in the south,"" it said. ""If the driver can prove by showing proof of address in Ireland - a scanned version of a utility bill, etc - they will be allowed in without proof of a negative test."" However, it added: ""Drivers with UK passports driving Northern Ireland-registered trucks or working for Northern Ireland haulage companies may have more difficulty in coming through. ""They risk being sent back if they do not have a valid PCR or antigen test."" 'Neither fair nor practical' Seamus Leheny from Freight NI said it was very unfair for Northern Ireland drivers. ""It seems more political rather than practical,"" Mr Leheny said. ""It's just another bit of red tape and a major inconvenience for businesses to try and get drivers tested before arrival into France. ""You could be a haulier in Newry and you could be leaving today for France and then a haulier from a couple of miles across the border in Dundalk could be on the same boat, but you would need a test and they don't. ""It doesn't seem fair or practical."" Mr Leheny said drivers with an Irish passport driving a Northern Ireland lorry would also need to be tested.

"Firefighters were called to the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, which is located on the north east of the island, at about 11:20 on Sunday. Extra fire crews were flown in from Sumburgh by helicopter with others arriving on the island by boat. Observatory president Roy Dennis said the building had been ""lost to fire"", adding it was ""absolutely tragic news"". A family including two children who live in the flat adjoining the lodge were unhurt. There are no guests staying at the lodge for the winter season. 'Colossal blow' Mr Dennis said: ""Thank goodness no loss of life but heartfelt sympathy to David, Susannah and family and the islanders. We will rebuild. We have lost much and will lose a year. Close to my heart - very very sad."" And Shetland MSP Tavish Scott described it as a ""colossal blow to the isle"". One local told BBC Scotland a Fair Isle boat crew spotted smoke while out on the water just after leaving the harbour, and turned back to raise the alarm. The fire is understood to have started in the roof. Photographer Rob Fray could see a plume of smoke from the blaze from the Sumburgh Hotel in Shetland - approximately 30 miles across the water. Scientific research A statement on the Fair Isle Observatory & Guesthouse website said: ""A major fire has tragically destroyed the Obs."" A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said: ""Operations Control mobilised crews from Fair Isle and Shetland, with the crew from Lerwick transported via the Maritime Coastguard Agency's Search and Rescue helicopter. ""Further resources were later mobilised to help tackle the fire, with two crews transported from Shetland to Fair Isle with the assistance of the RNLI."" The observatory is a popular tourist spot for bird watching and for scientific research into seabirds and bird migration. It is also important to the economy of Fair Isle, which is famous for its knitting and has a population of about 60. It was established in 1948 with the current building constructed in 2010, offering three-star accommodation to visitors. The observatory is run by an independent charity but has close links to other organisations such as the National Trust for Scotland which owns the remainder of the island.

"By Chris LongBBC News, Salford As a result, Kevin Parrott has spent 35 years living the ""life of Brian"", thanks to his involvement in what has become one of music's most enduring one-hit wonders. Kevin picked up the moniker of Brian when Michael Coleman split with his singing partner Brian Burke and asked his old friend, who was playing in another band at the time, to become his musical other half. The split came after the first round of records had been pressed, so it was too late for a name change, ensuring that Kevin had to endure a plethora of radio interviews explaining how he was not called Brian. Ahead of an anniversary show he says he does not mind it too much in hindsight, particularly as the song nearly never made it out at all. ""I sent out cassettes to most of the major labels, including the one I was on with my band, Oscar. ""I only remember getting a response from Phillips Records - the guy said, 'come on, it isn't very strong is it? We're passing'. ""The following day, Pye Records called to say they would release it and were convinced that it would be number one."" 'Catchy tune' He says he was not quite as confident about hitting the top spot, but had loved the song ever since he first heard it. ""Mick played me Lowry's Song, as it was then, in my kitchen in the spring of 1977. ""The song made an instant impression because of his outstanding lyric, catchy tune and the chorus hook. ""It was originally faster and more strident than people know now, and was verse chorus, verse chorus, verse chorus. ""I used to stay awake at night thinking how I could break it up - hence the brass link between verses one and two, and the chorus not coming in until after that second verse."" Even with the changes and Pye's backing though, the song was not an instant hit. Originally released in November 1977, it slowly gathered support, rising to the top ten by Easter 1978. Kevin says what happened next is etched on his mind. ""The record dropped from three to four at Easter week and we thought we'd done OK at that, but Pye were convinced the sales figures were skewed due to the holidays. ""The following week, Mick and me were in London to do the Palladium. ""We were fast asleep in a small hotel on chart day morning after a late night out, when the hotel owner banged on the door and shouted 'Get up, you guys are bloody number one'. ""We thought he was having us on and went back to sleep."" He says the next few weeks were ""all a bit of a daze, as we were selling 60,000 a day"". 'Too folky' With such sales, it is hard to work out why Brian and Michael never had another hit. For Kevin, the reason lies somewhere between image problems and record choices. ""Perhaps our image was a bit too folky,"" he says. ""The day before our first Top Of The Pops, Mick and me went shopping in Manchester to buy waistcoats and granddad shirts for the appearance. ""I had been in a rock band - perhaps I should have stuck with the tight jeans, knee-high leather boots and even longer hair. ""Mick consistently wrote great songs, but the follow-up Pye chose, Evensong, wasn't one of his. It should have been Mam When's Me Dad Coming Home, which was the third release. ""However, we did what we did and have always been grateful for the success we had and the pleasure the song has given to so many people."" The song continues to give that pleasure. More than three decades on, Kevin says whenever the pair play Matchstalk Men ""we never fail to be moved by the reaction we get"". ""There'll be people standing on tables waiving their arms or we'll be hugged by large ladies and men with tattoos and tears in their eyes who tell us how it connects them with family memories. ""It's become some sort of anthem, even with young people. ""I guess that at the time it was a song loved by the whole family, and the generations have since grown up with it and passed it on.""

"Around 9,000 flights are predicted on Friday, which would exceed the previous record of 8,854 set on 25 May 2018. Air traffic controller Nats said there would be a surge in chartered flights and private jets ahead of Saturday's clash between Tottenham and Liverpool. Greenpeace said it showed Uefa was not taking climate change seriously. As they begin their journeys to Madrid, fans have been posting their progress on social media. With flights to the Spanish capital at a premium, many have had to go via other countries to reach their final destination. Nats has predicted an extra 800 flights will take off over the weekend, but that could increase as some private jets may not have registered their flight plans yet. That number is on top of the 8,000 flights it would handle on a typical day at this time of year. It says more than half of the extra charter flights will be to and from Liverpool Airport. Among the thousands of fans heading to Madrid is Conservative MP - and Tottenham supporter - Tracey Crouch, who tweeted a picture of her toenails painted with blue sparkles for the occasion. A Nats spokeswoman said it would be a huge undertaking to look after the extra flights at what is already the busiest time of year. She said: ""There is no doubt this is going to be a challenging weekend, with limited capacity on the ground at some airports and in the air making delays possible."" Greenpeace said playing the final in Madrid - despite both teams being from England - had the same environmental impact as ""producing, driving and disposing of over 1,500 family cars"". Areeba Hamid, climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: ""It's more than obvious that Uefa is not taking climate change in the least bit seriously. All sectors, including international sports like football, will have to look at reducing their emissions rapidly if we are to halt irreversible climate breakdown. ""The first step towards football doing its bit should be Uefa accepting that we are in a climate emergency, and making their decisions in that context."" Last Friday 24 May had been forecast to be the busiest day for flights to date - with a bank holiday, school half-term, the Monaco Grand Prix, and Cannes Film Festival contributing to a spike - but it fell just shy of the record with 8,742 flights taking place.

"By Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent It comes as Carmarthenshire council provisionally approved the business case for the development but raised concerns over the legal process. The village is expected to include leisure, education and health services. The authority said it would only give the final approval once it had assurances over those concerns. The council is looking at alternative ways to deliver the Wellness Village. The project is expected to receive Â£40m from the UK and Welsh governments through the Swansea Bay City Deal, subject to the business case. It will get a further Â£32m from the council and is expected to raise another Â£128m from the private sector. The leader of the Labour group on the council, councillor Rob James, welcomed the decision to seek further assurances about the project ""in light of the suspensions at Swansea University"". ""Considering the strong working relationship between officers at Carmarthenshire council and those in Swansea University, I will be writing to the Wales Audit Office to ask for their participation in investigating the paper trail for the last few years,"" he added. ""It is absolutely essential that the public receive reassurances that the project continues to be a sound investment and that there have been no potential conflicts of interest in the Authority."" But the leader of the council, Plaid Cymru councillor Emlyn Dole, said the business case was ""robust"". ""Executive Board members are satisfied that the project business case for the village is robust, but we need some further reassurance before finally signing it off,"" said Mr Dole. ""Given the ongoing internal investigation at Swansea University, this is the right and prudent thing to do because we need to show that due legal process has been followed and public funds have been fully protected."" But there have been concerns following the suspension of members of staff at Swansea University last week. That includes the dean of the business school, Prof Marc Clement, who was involved in writing the submission for the City Deal funding, which includes the Wellness Village.

"By Conor MacauleyBBC NI Agriculture & Environment Correspondent The Renewable Heat Association (RHANI) said it had reports of several firms shutting down. It said they could no longer service the bank loans they had taken out to install the biomass boilers. New tariff rates took effect from 1 April. These new rates have substantially reduced the subsidy to be earned from the boilers. The price controls run for one year, pending permanent measures to be agreed by the Northern Ireland Assembly. RHANI said it had ""already had reports of immediate redundancies and winding up of businesses from a number of members due to the financial uncertainty of changes to their tariff"". ""Sectors including agriculture, which traditionally operates on a very low-profit margin are badly affected by the imposition of these changes. ""It appears that a number of businesses cannot now service the bank loans that they took out to buy the specialist biomass boilers required for this government promoted incentive scheme."" The Renewable Heat Association is to challenge the new tariff arrangements in a court case listed for June. In a statement on Thursday, it said that it had been made aware of at least five companies who had advised ""that they are at risk as a direct result of the implementation of the updated RHI tariffs"". It added that it ""had been advised by a number of RHI participants"" that they had received letters from the department dated for Thursday, 6 April, to notify them of the new tariffs. ""As more businesses become aware of the changes made by the department with no prior notice, we expect the number of companies facing hardship to increase significantly over the coming days,"" the RHANI added. Background The botched energy scheme was set up in 2012 when Arlene Foster was minister at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. It was an attempt by the Northern Ireland Executive to help to increase the consumption of fuel from renewable sources. However, businesses received more in subsidies than they paid for renewable fuel, and the scheme became oversubscribed. The fallout from the scandal, which is approximately Â£490m over budget, resulted in the collapse of Stormont's institutions and the calling of snap elections on 2 March. Retired appeal court judge Sir Patrick Coghlin is to chair a public inquiry into the scheme. A judge ruled at the beginning of March that corporate companies receiving RHI subsidies could be named by the Department for the Economy.",A group which represents hundreds of Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) boiler owners says some of its members are folding because of cuts to the payments they are receiving.

He added that whilst Thursday's weather had been ""exceptional"" it was wrong that the A55 had been shut twice in the space of five months due to flooding. ""There needs to be an urgent review of drainage on the A55 taking into account the age of some sections of the road and our changing weather patterns,"" he added.

The spokesperson added that contingency plans were in place for adverse events, including agreed diversionary routes and lines of communication with the public and emergency services. ""However, extreme events such as the flooding that occurred yesterday are very difficult to avoid and therefore by their nature the response to them is reactive.

"West Mercia Police believe there was an altercation before the incident on the A38 in Wychbold, Worcestershire, on Monday afternoon. The pedestrian, a man in his 60s, was taken to hospital in Birmingham with head and chest injuries, before he died. The arrested man in his 50s remains in custody, according to police.

"The BBC learned on Monday health watchdog NICE is to recommend a ban on the use of mesh operations for treating organ prolapse in England. Pontypridd MP Owen Smith, chair of the all-party parliamentary group on mesh, has called for Wales to suspend usage. A Welsh Government task and finish group started meeting last month. It is reviewing use of the mesh. Mesh implants, which include different types of plastic tape and slings, are used to ease incontinence and to support organs such as the vagina, uterus, bowel, bladder or urethra which have prolapsed after childbirth. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We are currently reviewing the use of vaginal mesh and tape and will await the NICE recommendations.""",A decision on whether to continue using vaginal mesh and tape for operations in Wales will be made once watchdog recommendations are published.
"The perception that in some areas police had lost control of the streets was the most important reason disorder spread, they said. The Home Affairs Committee said insufficient numbers of officers were initially deployed and police training for public disorder was inadequate. The Metropolitan Police said it had outlined what it was doing to improve. The Policing Large Scale Disorder: Lessons from the disturbances of August 2011 report said flooding the streets with police was what ultimately quelled the disorder. ""If numbers could have been increased more rapidly, it is possible that some of the disturbances could have been avoided,"" it said. ""We regret this did not happen and, with the benefit of hindsight, we regard the operation to police the disorder in many towns and cities, and particularly in London as flawed."" It said the mutual aid system, under which police officers are transferred to forces in need, could have operated more quickly; it may have left areas which had loaned officers to other forces ""vulnerable"". Copycat behaviour The report said anecdotal evidence from some of those convicted suggested the widespread disorder started when people saw police had ""lost control"" in Tottenham via television and social media. This echoes the findings of the independent Riots Communities and Victims Panel. ""Clearly a feeling existed that desirable consumer goods could be made available by looting. There was a substantial element of opportunistic criminality and copycat behaviour,"" the report said. ""The absence of a police presence or sight of police officers apparently standing by and allowing criminal behaviour to take place was distressing for those whose homes and businesses were being attacked,"" it added. Committee chairman Keith Vaz MP said: ""Individual police officers acted with great bravery, and we commend them for their actions. However, in London and other areas, in contrast with the effectiveness of police responses in some towns and cities, there was a failure of police tactics. ""This situation might have been avoided had police appreciated the magnitude of the task. ""We urgently require a rapid improvement in police training to deal with public disorder. We urge the police to act more quickly in future and to review the arrangements for loaning officers from one force to another in this type of scenario."" He said that, for those who lost their homes and businesses, ""the state effectively ceased to exist - sometimes for hours at a time"". Mr Vaz told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the committee felt that there should have been better communication between the police and the local business community to ensure that people knew what was happening and how best to protect their livelihoods. ""Those areas where the chief constables had decided to take pre-emptive action and get police officers on the streets quickly were able to contain this violence much more effectively,"" he added. The MPs say had more officers been deployed different tactics could have been used. The Met Police is training more police to use baton rounds and is considering buying three water cannon. Mr Vaz said the committee did not feel water cannon would have helped police in the riots and may have caused ""even greater disorders"". Communication failures Riots broke out in Tottenham, north London, on 6 August, two days after the fatal shooting by police of 29-year-old Mark Duggan. Unrest spread across London and to other cities, including Manchester, Birmingham and Bristol over the following days. But the committee's report said the specific causes behind the riots were still unknown. The report criticised the Met Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission over failures in communication with Mr Duggan's family, which it said made a potentially tense situation worse. The committee also concluded it would be unhelpful to switch off social media during times of disorder, following claims rioters used it to organise themselves. ""People who made an active decision to join in the disorder could equally well have heard about it on the television as on social media,"" the report said. The MPs say the government needs to urgently clarify whether the police authorities will be able to recover the Â£89.827m it cost to police the riots. It says the riots were an exceptional series of events at a time the authorities were being asked to make savings. They also call on the government to speed up the process of reimbursing people under the Riot Damages Act. Exceptional criminality The Met Police said it had already recognised and publicised some of its findings on the issues identified and what it was doing to improve. A spokesman said: ""This includes acknowledging that we didn't have enough officers available quickly enough to respond to the initial disorder or its subsequent unprecedented escalation. As a result we have changed our mobilisation plans."" He added that the force was reviewing how it engaged with local communities and was working with Acpo and the IPCC to ensure communication was more effective in future investigations. The Association of Chief Police Officers said the report had identified issues it believed was critical to get right within current policing reforms. ""This includes the capacity and ability to move sufficient numbers of police officers around the country when required to protect the public from national threats,"" a spokesman said. ""We will continue to look at all the various reports into the disorder to examine how the police service can best respond in future to the kind of exceptional criminality seen in August.""","The policing operation to tackle the summer riots across England was flawed, a report from MPs has concluded."

"Hannah Cobley, 29, left the child wrapped in plastic bags in an overgrown area of the Leicestershire farm where she lived with her parents. A post-mortem examination revealed the baby suffered three skull fractures and survived for two hours before dying. Cobley was sentenced at Leicester Crown Court to serve a minimum of 18 years. Justice Susan Carr said she had committed a ""totally shocking crime"". ""I find without hesitation that you intended to kill the baby,"" she said. Justice Carr described how, instead of calling for medical assistance, Cobley hit the baby's head against the hard tiles in the toilet. Cobley, whose father owns a transport business and also keeps livestock on the farm in Stoney Stanton, denied murdering the baby who she gave birth to in an outside toilet on 26 April 2017. She claimed the girl had been stillborn but was found guilty of murder by a jury on Thursday. The court heard that in the hours following the birth, Cobley searched the internet to find out how long a newborn could ""survive without being fed"". The pregnancy, which was the result of a consensual one-night stand, had been kept secret from her family and friends. In the days after giving birth, Cobley - who worked as a driver for her father's firm - collapsed on a family holiday in Skegness. She was taken to Leicester Royal Infirmary where she told her father about the baby. Cobley's father Peter told police she told him it ""wasn't alive or anything"", and he did his ""fatherly bit"" by consoling her. The jury was told the girl had been born about eight weeks premature but was a normal, healthy baby. Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC told the court Cobley ""had no regard for the sanctity of human life"". He said: ""Had Miss Cobley not been admitted to hospital, the body may never have been found. There was little or no remorse during the trial - she is a profoundly self-interested young woman."" Defending, Andrew Smith QC said Cobley has ""demonstrated the ability to work hard"". ""She is an individual that has the capability to rehabilitate."" Speaking outside the court, Det Insp Jonathan Blockley from Leicestershire Police said it had been ""extremely sad and tragic case"" for officers to investigate. He said: ""Cobley could have sought help from her own family or professionals but instead took actions into her own hands. ""This decision meant a newborn baby girl was denied her life.""

"Anne Sacoolas is suspected of being involved in a car crash that killed British motorcyclist Harry Dunn, who died in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Mrs Sacoolas later left the UK to return home to the US, after telling local police she had no such plans. The note was photographed as Mr Trump addressed reporters at the White House. It reads: ""(If raised) Note, as Secretary Pompeo told Foreign Secretary Raab, that the spouse of the US government employee will not return to the United Kingdom."" Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". Speaking to Sky News about the photograph of the notes, Mrs Charles said: ""I'm just disgusted. ""I don't see the point in Boris Johnson talking to President Trump, or President Trump even taking a call from Boris Johnson. ""If he'd already made his decision that if it were to be asked and if it were to be raised, the answer was already going to be no."" Downing Street confirmed Mr Johnson had urged the US president to reconsider the decision to grant immunity to Mrs Sacoolas. At the press briefing, Mr Trump called Mr Dunn's death a ""terrible accident"" and confirmed his administration would seek to speak to Mrs Sacoolas. Police have said CCTV of the crash in which the teenager died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road. Speaking at the press briefing on Wednesday evening - after his conversation with the prime minister - Mr Trump said: ""The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. ""You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. ""So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet."" What is diplomatic immunity? About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It means that, in theory, they cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. However, where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List. Drivers, cooks and other support staff who have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity. Speaking in Northampton, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the use of diplomatic immunity in the case was ""completely unacceptable"". He said: ""We would put every possible bit of pressure we could on the United States and if we could mount legal action on the United States, we would do so."" The crash in which Mr Dunn died happened close to RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan worked. Northamptonshire Police Chief Constable Nick Adderley said, ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". Mr Dunn's parents are planning to travel to Washington DC as soon as possible. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said the UK was ""getting the brush-off"" from the US as a result of ""cuddling up"" to Mr Trump. Speaking on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Thornberry said the UK had been ""holding his hand... and being a Trump tribute act"", which flattered the president who is ""only interested in himself"". She said although it was ""very unusual"" for the prime minister to ask for assistance from the president, Britain needed to ""hold its head a bit higher and look Donald Trump in the eye and be clear about what it is we want"". Analysis By James Robbins, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent The speaking note which the president held in his hand seems to be confirmation the United States simply will not agree to the return of Anne Sacoolas to the UK. Whatever the rights and wrongs of their case, that has always been and seems likely to remain the American position. Why? Washington has a whole raft of unstated motives. They simply don't want the spouse of this particular ""US government employee"" exposed to questioning, particularly, but not exclusively, because of the likely nature of his work in super-secret military communications routed through RAF Croughton. More broadly, the Americans are determined not to encourage any country to believe they will succeed in requesting a waiver of diplomatic immunity. After all, if we don't do it for our first among allies, the UK, what chance has any other country got. And, most broadly of all, America's idea of its own ""exceptionalism"" means it hates the idea of offering up any citizen for trial in a foreign court - that is, by anyone other than fellow Americans. Number 10 said the prime minister had urged Mr Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Mrs Sacoolas immunity in order that ""the individual involved can return to the UK, co-operate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice"". The teenager's parents have described a meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday as a ""publicity stunt"". Mrs Charles said she felt ""let down"" by both the UK and US governments, while Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunn said: ""I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's OK to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away."" Following the meeting, Mr Raab said the justice process was ""not being allowed to properly run its course"".","A woman at the centre of a row over diplomatic immunity will not return to the UK, according to briefing notes held by US President Donald Trump."
"By James WilliamsBBC Politics Wales It says its ""rapid recovery"" economic package would create thousands of jobs. The plan will be put into action if the party gains power following May's Senedd elections. Projects in the ""green economic stimulus"" could include thousands of new social homes, greater investment in renewable energy, and more electric vehicle charging points. Plaid would also offer long-term zero-interest loans ""to get businesses back on their feet"". Part of its plan to pay for the package would involve asking the UK government to increase the Welsh Government's borrowing powers. But if the Treasury rejects the request, then Plaid says it would use councils' powers to borrow money and investment from the new UK infrastructure bank to fund the proposals. Its ""plan B"" would also include ""appropriate use"" of the Mutual Investment Model (MIM) - a funding model developed by the current Welsh Government whereby private partners are awarded contracts to build and maintain public assets. A project to turn an 11-mile (18km) stretch of the A465 heads of the Valleys road into a dual carriageway between Dowlais and Hirwaun is the first project to be delivered using the MIM. Delyth Jewell, Plaid Cymru's South Wales East Senedd member, said the scheme's eventual cost of more than Â£1bn was a ""waste of public money"". Plaid leader Adam Price said the ""ambitious but deliverable"" ideas included in his party's Rebuild Wales rapid recovery plan should have been introduced years ago had the Labour Welsh government shown ""greater urgency"". Mr Price said: ""Within its first few hours, a Plaid Cymru government would announce a Â£6bn green economic stimulus, creating almost 60,000 jobs through tasking the National Infrastructure Commission with delivering shovel-ready investable projects. ""These could include building thousands of new social homes, retrofitting existing homes, expanding and electrifying the rail network, and delivering the fastest broadband to all parts of Wales,"" he added. The Â£6bn programme of investment is based on analysis commissioned by the Wales Trades Union Congress, which recommends â16 infrastructure projects over two years. 'Local first' It suggests the projects could create 59,000 jobs, including 45,500 direct jobs and 13,500 indirect jobs in the supply chains. Plaid is also promising an initial Â£50m investment to introduce a ""Welsh youth guarantee giving secure employment to every 16 to 24-year-old on at least a living wage"". People recently made redundant would potentially be able to benefit from a national training programme for workers to reskill. A trial would be introduced to give people aged over 25 ""a lifelong personal learning account' with an initial tax-free credit of Â£5,000, and loans for more expensive courses on the same terms as university tuition fees. Mr Price also promised that a Plaid government would ""implement a new 'local first' procurement policy to give preference to small and medium-sized local businesses - setting a target of increasing Welsh firms' share of public procurement from 52% to 75%, creating up to 46,000 jobs"".","A Plaid Cymru government would invest Â£6bn in ""shovel-ready"" projects, the party has pledged."
"L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, of Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, and L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, died on 13 July 2013. Cpl James Dunsby, from Bath, died later in hospital. The inquest was due to start in Solihull, West Midlands, in October. It will now be held after an appeal against a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision not to bring charges. The CPS decided not to bring gross negligence manslaughter charges in July, a decision families of two of the soldiers have lodged appeals about under a Victims Right to Review scheme. Birmingham and Solihull senior coroner Louise Hunt has previously said that, as an inquest is not a criminal hearing, the CPS review must be dealt with before an inquest is held to avoid prejudicing any possible future criminal trial. The soldiers, who died from overheating, had been taking part in a 40-mile (64km) hike on Pen y Fan as part of a four-week trial for the Territorial Army's SAS reservists.

"Ray Bailey, director of Harley Facades, said there was ""quite widespread"" confusion in the building industry at the time of the refurbishment. The cladding has been blamed for fuelling the fire at the tower block. The inquiry into the fire, which killed 72 people, is in its second phase. It is now looking into how the 24-storey tower in west London came to be covered in such cladding during its refurbishment between 2012 and 2016, before the fire on 14 June 2017. The inquiry is investigating whether the confusion about fire ratings was one of the reasons dangerous cladding and insulation was used to refurbish the tower. Mr Bailey said he had a ""misunderstanding"" about which materials were approved for use on tall buildings. One section of the guidance for meeting the government's building regulations stated that materials used on towers above 18m needed to have a Class 0 (zero) rating, though another European classification was equally acceptable. The government has always insisted that another section of the guidance required the insulation used in cladding systems to be of ""limited combustibility"" as well. Under questioning, Mr Bailey said he had believed at the time that if the materials were Class 0 ""throughout"" this also meant they were also classed as being of ""limited combustibility"" - in other words, less likely to burn. However, Class 0 is only a classification of the way the surface of a product such as cladding resists the spread of flames, not its overall combustibility. The insulation panels used on Grenfell Tower were rated Class 0, but were not of limited combustibility. Neither was the cladding, Reynobond PE, which had a core made from flammable plastic. The inquiry also heard that the manufacturer of the cladding - Arconic - had tested various configurations of its product in 2013, and found they had achieved poor ratings for fire safety. The product performed worse when it was shaped into ""cassette"" boxes, the design used at Grenfell Tower. According to a manager's statement, shown at the inquiry, one test had to be stopped due to a 'flash-over', meaning the cladding could only be rated E, out of a possible A to F. The tests were first revealed following a BBC investigation in 2018, which found the company did not pass the results to the body which issues product certificates in the UK, relied on by the building industry. The certificate for Reynobond PE, the cladding used at Grenfell, stated it had a class B rating. Arconic sent Mr Bailey this certificate in April 2014, as the materials for Grenfell were being chosen, but made no mention of the poor test results in the covering email. Mr Bailey told the inquiry he was unaware of the tests. The role of the manufacturer will be examined when it gives evidence later in the inquiry. The inquiry continues. A separate government consultation on plans to improve fire safety regulations is due to close on 12 October.","The fire safety guidance for what materials could be used on Grenfell Tower was ""confusing"", the director of the company which installed the cladding has told an inquiry."

HM Coastguard Southend-on-Sea, said the teenagers had been ""wading way out offshore and were spotted by three local kitesurfers"" about one mile (1.6km) out near Barge Pier. The pair were ""struggling in the water as they had been caught out by a rip current"", the coastguard wrote on Facebook. ""They were by then being quickly swept out by the tide towards the shipping lanes - with the female casualty not able to swim, her male friend was trying to keep them both above water in the strong currents.

"Hundreds of trees have already been removed to reveal half a mile of 1,900-year-old road in Puddletown Forest.

The clearance work was carried out by the Forestry Commission in partnership with English Heritage. The 85ft-wide (26m) road, which consists of a raised plateau flanked by two ditches, would have carried troops, supplies, slaves and livestock. The cobbled ""street"" would have been used for troop movements while the outer droving roads would have been used for animals.

"By Chris MorrisReality Check correspondent, BBC News Here's an initial look at a few of the claims they've made. The report suggests the Treasury would receive about Â£80bn in extra revenue over the next 15 years, with an overall long-term gain for GDP of about 7%. These figures are based on a number of calculations and assumptions, not all of which stand up to scrutiny. Those who have modelled a clean Brexit properly, the EFT asserts, report long-term gains from free trade of 2%-4% of GDP. The report dismisses alternative modelling - done by the Treasury and by Whitehall's Cross Departmental Brexit Analysis - which arrived at very different conclusions. But that is part of the problem. The EFT are convinced that they are the only people who have modelled the data correctly - even though theirs is a minority view. ""The vast majority of economists think it will be different,"" says Prof Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex. ""Because a hard Brexit will cut trade with the EU, which is by far our largest trading partner, significantly."" Chequers plan 'worse than status quo' What is the 'no deal' WTO option? Last year the UK exported almost Â£274bn in goods and services to the EU, compared with Â£112bn to the US. When it comes to imports, the UK imported Â£341bn in goods and services from the EU and Â£70bn from the US. For those who love the detail, here is one example of economists who criticise the EFT's methodology. Tory supporters of Brexit are, however, unbowed: ""Perhaps it's our fault,"" says leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, ""by not putting the argument for a world trade deal earlier, we left the running to people who don't want us to leave the EU at all."" The EFT report also says the UK would no longer have to pay a net amount of Â£12bn to the EU every year, although that figure appears to be slightly inflated. According to the Treasury net payments to the EU amounted to Â£9.6bn in 2016 and Â£8.9bn in 2017. Forecasts over the next five years suggest that - if the UK were to stay in the EU - net payments to the EU would rise to roughly Â£11bn a year. The EFT report goes on to suggest that the UK could choose to withhold ""most or all"" of the estimated Â£39bn financial settlement that the government has provisionally agreed to pay the EU as part of a Withdrawal Agreement. In theory, the UK could do that, but it would probably prompt a legal challenge from the EU, and it would certainly damage relations severely at a time when - as the EFT report suggests - the government would be looking for co-operation in a whole series of policy areas. The report suggests that concern about congestion at UK borders after Brexit has been hugely inflated. It says only 4% of goods arriving in the UK from non-EU countries are subject to checks, and it suggests that trade with the EU in future could therefore be almost as seamless as it is now. It's correct that very few physical or documentary checks are carried out on non-EU goods. But evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee suggests that things are rather more complicated than that. If a lorry arrives at Dover, for example, from a non-EU country, it is usually delayed by 60 to 90 minutes even if no checks are made. The UK could choose to speed up that process and abolish many checks, but there would still be far more checks on UK goods being exported to the EU via Dover. There would also be further complications for UK exports. Once the UK is designated as a third country by the EU, all UK exports of animal origin would only be able to enter EU territory via a veterinary border inspection post, where there are often time-consuming physical inspections as well as documentary checks. Neither the Eurotunnel nor the Calais port is currently designated as a veterinary border inspection post. The EFT report says that under WTO rules sanitary and phytosanitary measures (ie safety checks on food) can't be used as a ""surreptitious means of inhibiting cross-border trade"". This is true, but that does not erase what are known as non-tariff-barriers entirely, it simply reduces inspections where possible. ""The only countries that have managed to remove the need for health checks on food being exported to the EU,"" says Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, ""are the European Economic Area members and Switzerland. They have not only implemented EU rules in this area domestically, they also apply EU checks on all imports of animal origin entering from the rest of the world."" Food prices The EFT report also suggests lifting tariffs (or import charges) on imported goods to make prices cheaper. It recognises that if you do that for one country, you have to do it for every country, under WTO rules. If tariffs were removed for all agricultural produce, cheap imports would flood in and food prices would fall - but the UK farming industry could be decimated. So, the report says, that ""perhaps the most attractive goods to target"" might be ones that we don't produce in the UK at all. It mentions oranges as one example, but it would be a pretty limited number of goods. Again, others are extremely sceptical about the EFT's policy proposals. According to a report published earlier this year by the House of Lords European Union Committee, ""EU food imports cannot easily be replaced by either producing more in the UK or importing more from non-EU countries"". The Lords report forecast that food prices were likely to rise without a Brexit deal.

"The couple, who cannot be named, were found guilty of five child cruelty charges last month. The boy was also beaten, he had to defecate on the floor, and he shared a broken mattress with his brother. A judge at Northampton Crown Court sentenced the boy's father to seven years in prison and his mother to three and a half years. The trial related to events between 2012 and 2016. Professionals described it as the worst case of child cruelty they had seen in 25 years. The case came to light when two of the boy's sisters told one of their school teachers about him defecating in the house, and the teacher informed social services. Prosecutor James Armstrong-Holmes had said this was a case involving serious neglect and a ""deliberate disregard for the welfare of the victim"". 'Nothing short of depraved' In mitigation, defence barrister Andrew Fitch-Holland, said the boy's father had simply been overwhelmed by events, and insisted he had not been driven by malice. Barnaby Shaw, speaking on behalf of the boy's mother, told the court she had been a secondary partner in the abuse and did not have control over events in the house. The couple had a large, undisclosed, number of children. The youngest have been adopted, and the rest are in care. Sentencing, Judge Michael Fowler said the father had told ""obvious lies"". He also criticised the way the couple had used one bedroom and just two beds for four of their children. Det Con Nicky Webb, from Northamptonshire Police, said: ""In 20 years of working in child protection I have never before encountered abuse and neglect on this scale."" An NSPCC spokesperson said: ""For a mother and father to lock up their own child, make him sleep in his own excrement and force his siblings to beat him is nothing short of depraved."" A Northamptonshire County Council spokesman acknowledged the ""difficult and serious nature"" of the case and said ""significant changes"" had been made to systems and practices as a result of its work with the Children's Commissioner.","Parents who locked their son in a room, banned him from speaking and fed him old food have been jailed."
"Peter HenleyPolitical editor, South of England@BBCPeterHon Twitter Some will be in Euros, some in Sterling, some will be real-terms adjusted for inflation, others will be back-of-the fag packet guesstimates. And all these claims will be misleading. Even if you can you get your head around what ""X squillion Euros"" is worth when it's spread across the 503 million inhabitants of 4 million square kms of land even Jean-Claude Juncker would struggle to get a perspective that can properly appreciate all the costs and benefits to each of the 28 countries from any given act of Brussels. So we will have to vote on our gut feeling. In the south of England we are closer to the continent than the rest of the UK. It is easier for us to cross the channel, and yet that seems to give us a more Euro-sceptic gut. At the last election we elected more UKIP MEPs than any other party, including their leader Nigel Farage, with 32% of the vote, Conservatives came second with 31% and Labour third on 15%. The EU spends less of its development money on us than other parts of the UK. These blue flags announcing the arrival of a Euro-grant are more commonplace in Burnley than Basingstoke. As one of the most prosperous parts of the UK, are we more confident about any economic impact of leaving the EU? Are we more worried about issues like immigration with Calais on our doorstep? Or with London up the road should we worry that the City stands to lose heavily if Paris or Berlin hijack its financial position? The last remaining Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder is elected by south-east England voters. She publishes a list of top 10 ""myths"" about the EU and her number one is Brussels bureaucrats impose laws upon us and we have no say in it. This she says is not true because the commission has no powers to impose law on EU countries, it can only propose legislation. And yet others would point to David Cameron's desperate struggle to gain compromises from the other states. Sceptics would argue his pleading and the sheer hard work he's had to put in to gain concessions show clearly how much power has been lost. It may prove just as difficult for pollsters to predict the gut feeling to work who wins or loses. So how about this analysis: It's going to be Bank versus Bus. How ever much we grumble about our bank it's true the bother involved puts many of us off the idea of change. So the bank theory goes, in the end we won't vote to leave the EU. Conservative MEP Dan Hannan offers the bus theory instead. If you find yourself on the wrong bus, heading away from where you want to go, you should get off at the first available stop. Bank or Bus. It's got to be better than counting those Euro grants.","During this referendum campaign you will hear many claims of how much the EU costs, and how much benefit we derive."

"Lord Freud, a former welfare minister, wrote a letter to judges presiding over the trial of the disgraced former Conservative MP, Charlie Elphicke. The Lords Commissioner for Standards has found the peer had ""failed to act on his personal honour"". Lord Freud said he acted on a matter of principle, but accepted he should not have added his name to the letter. Lord Freud was rebuked last December along with a group of Conservative MPs for lobbying judges during the trial of Charlie Elphicke, who was subsequently jailed for two years for sexually assaulting two women. They had written to the judges over the potential public release of the statements they had given to a court in support of their former colleague. Journalists had asked for disclosure of the character statements, which were considered by a judge as she decided on Elphicke's sentence. The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Burnett, said at the time there had been ""nothing quite like"" the letter - although it was not the first time an MP had tried to lobby a judge behind the scenes. In a short personal statement, Lord Freud said his motive in putting his name to the letter was ""purely to alert the judiciary to what I considered an important issue of principle"". He added: ""I recognise that it was not my place to do so and I should not have added my name to the letters. I apologise to the House and the judiciary."" Personal honour The Lords Commissioner for Standards, who conducted an investigation into the matter, concluded that Lord Freud had sought to use his position as a parliamentarian in private correspondence to influence an active court case. She said this conduct was outside the standards of conduct expected of peers and amounted to a ""failure to act on his personal honour"". In her report, the Commissioner accepted Lord Freud's explanation that he was acting to assist members of the public rather than for his own benefit. She acknowledged that he now regrets signing the letters and so no further action other than an apology was recommended.",A Conservative peer has apologised to the House of Lords and the judiciary after breaching the code of conduct.
"Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer put forward a motion for debate on Wednesday calling for details of the strategy, with support from some on the Conservative back benches. Now the government has tabled an amendment to win them back. But sources are not committing Theresa May to publish any specific plans. The motion will still be debated on Wednesday as part of the Opposition Day debate offered to rival parties to choose their subject for discussion in the House of Commons. Mr Starmer tabled the motion, which said Mrs May should commit to publishing the plan for leaving the EU before Article 50 is invoked because it was ""Parliament's responsibility to properly scrutinise the government while respecting the decision of the British people to leave the European Union"". The motion received the backing of some Tory MPs, with pro-European figures like Anna Soubry pledging their support. But now, government sources have told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that an amendment has been put forward by Downing Street, agreeing to publishing a plan, in exchange for a commitment to invoking Article 50 before the end of March 2017. Steve Baker, Conservative MP for Wycombe, tweeted pictures of the amendments, claiming they also have the backing of the DUP and Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP. However, government sources would not confirm any specific form of document on any specific timetable to fit with the commitment to publish a Brexit plan, apart from saying that it will be before Article 50. Sources also said by accepting Labour's amendment, the government was not agreeing to give MPs a vote before the process of leaving the EU begins. Mr Starmer, who will lead the debate for Labour, called the amendment ""a welcome and hugely significant climbdown from the government"" and said his party would push for the Brexit plan to be published by January. ""For the last two months Labour have been pushing the government to put their plan for Brexit before Parliament and the public,"" he said. ""Without that plan, we have had unnecessary uncertainty, speculation and a running commentary on the government's likely approach. Labour will hold the government to account on this."" Ms Soubry, a Remain campaigner and Conservative MP for Broxtowe, added that the new amendment was a ""significant victory"". She told the BBC News Channel: ""We're moving in the right direction, which is that Parliament should have these debates and Parliament must trigger Article 50. The government need have no fear - we will vote to leave the EU because we have accepted the result of the referendum. But now we need to get the very best deal for our country."" Earlier, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would have to reach a Brexit deal by October 2018. He said time would ""be short"" for negotiations because the proposed deal needed to be ratified by the European Council and European Parliament as part of the two-year process set to be triggered by Article 50 being invoked in March.","Number 10 has accepted Labour's attempt to force the prime minister to publish a plan for Brexit before Article 50 is triggered, the BBC has learned."

"She predicted a change in British politics as voters look to parties like hers and UKIP for ""new answers"". The party is training activists at its annual conference in Brighton how to emulate UKIP's recent success. In her speech, Ms Bennett attacked the coalition over the economy and Labour for not providing an alternative. ""There is one alternative to the three virtually indistinguishable neoliberal parties,"" she told party members. ""That alternative is the Green Party."" The Green Party in England and Wales want to ban all advertising aimed at children and plan to set out proposals to boost the economy and end food poverty. They will use the conference to discuss how to tackle fuel poverty and oppose the privatisation of the NHS and Royal Mail. Ms Bennett said the health service was being ""torn to shreds"" and ""handed over to handful of profit-at-any-costs, multinational health companies."" To applause and cheers she told supporters: ""We will not rest until we've expelled every last corporate blood sucker from our NHS."" Boot camps BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the speech was ""defiantly and proudly left-wing in tone"". But on Saturday, the conference will discuss what it can learn from an unlikely source. A session is scheduled on how the Greens can ""break into mass popular awareness"" in the way that Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party managed in May's local elections, when it gained 139 councillors. Voters now talk about UKIP and the Greens ""in the same breath"", Ms Bennett told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier. ""Obviously our politics are very different. But people are looking for new answers and we're going to see big shifts in British politics in the next few years."" The party is also running ""election boot camps"" for candidates and activists at its conference in an effort to increase success. The Greens gained five council seats at this May's local elections in England but the party has failed to make a breakthrough, except in Brighton and a handful of other areas in England. Uncertain future Former leader Caroline Lucas has been MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010 and the party has run Brighton and Hove City Council as a minority administration since 2011. She told the BBC's Daily Politics programme the party could triple its tally of MEPs in next year's European elections, from two to six. Ms Lucas said the conference was the party's chance to encourage people to vote Green in the elections ""if they want a safer environment and a fairer social system"". Party leader Ms Bennett, a former journalist who took the reins last year, predicted the government would have to reverse its policy on fracking. The Greens have been prominent in the protests against the controversial drilling for shale gas. ""If we go for the 'dash for gas'... we're going for a really high-cost, uncertain energy future,"" she added. She used her speech to pay tribute to her predecessor, inviting delegates to applaud Ms Lucas before she started her address. The Australian-born leader hit out at the Lib Dems for failing ""to protect Britain from the Tories"" and was scathing about Labour's positioning on benefit cuts, public spending and immigration. Turning to international affairs, she called for a diplomatic solution to the Syrian crisis. ""Russia and China are not easy partners, but the legal way forward... is the only way forward,"" she said. But the bulk of the speech focused on social and economic policy. She called for more help for small and local businesses and promised to campaign until foodbanks were no longer needed. ""Volunteering shouldn't be about providing the essentials of life because the government is failing to do so."" Poverty was a theme returned to by Ms Lucas when she took to the stage later. ""We have a government that is intent on demonising the poor and vulnerable,"" the party's first and only MP said. ""This is worse than the Victorian era.""","Party leader Natalie Bennett has told supporters the Greens are the only alternative to the ""indistinguishable"" big Westminster parties."
"The fire took hold of the huts at Mudeford Sandbank, near Hengistbury Head, Bournemouth, on Saturday morning. Dorset Police said a man, aged 19 and from Christchurch, was arrested on suspicion of arson and burglary. Beach huts in the area have previously sold for Â£275,000. A boy, aged 15 and from Bournemouth, who was arrested on the same charges on Saturday has been released on police bail pending further enquiries.

"Mark Drakeford will set out further changes to the lockdown laws at a press conference on Friday. Businesses will be expected to ensure two-metre social distancing is observed. Other small changes may be announced, but the advice to stay local is likely to remain in place. Shops in England have been trading since the start of the week. But after that prompted queues outside retailers, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he does not want to see large crowds outside reopened retailers. The Welsh Government is expected to keep its cautious approach, and says its priority continues to be ""keep Wales safe"". Earlier the Scottish Government announced that retailers there could reopen on 29 June. At the daily Welsh Government press conference Mr Gething said he did not want to see a repeat ""of crowds bunched together outside shops in complete breach of what social-distancing guidance is supposed to deliver"". Earlier in the week Mr Drakeford said reopening retail was one of a ""package"" of measures being looked at. He said he was keen for the economy to reopen in Wales, but public health must come first ""as that is the best way for our economy"". Currently people in Wales are only allowed to travel locally - with five miles given as a guide. That is not expected to change on Friday. The rule has been criticised by Conservative politicians who say it unfairly harms people in rural areas. Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor Reopening shops is a move that has been heavily trailed by ministers and they are keen to stress that caution remains their watchword. The approach from the Welsh Government has been to announce one big thing in each review and then monitor its effect on the reproduction rate of the virus. Recently though, they have started putting sectors ""on notice"" for reopening - shops next week, followed by schools the week after. Perhaps this time there will be something for the tourism sector to look forward to? Non-essential shops have been closed to the public in Wales since lockdown began in late March. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Paul Davies claimed the Welsh Government had ""listened"" to its calls to begin to reopen the Welsh economy. ""But while we welcome this announcement, it frankly beggars belief as to why travel restrictions are not being lifted too,"" he said. ""Many retailers need custom from a wide area to survive and will go to the wall if they are forced to rely on local trade alone."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said the announcement did ""not come as a surprise"". ""Many people will be glad to see yet another element of easing restrictions,"" he said. ""However, we need to know not only which restrictions are being eased in the here and now but also which restrictions are expected to be lifted in the weeks and months ahead.""","Non-essential retailers in Wales will be told they can reopen from Monday, the first minister is expected to announce."
"Chesterfield FC said some players and staff, ""most of them vulnerable"", were given jabs to stop them being wasted. However, the medical centre which gave the vaccines has received dozens of angry phone calls since news of the vaccinations appeared in the media. One threatened a female member of staff, saying he knew where she lived. The woman has reported the threat to Derbyshire Police, which has confirmed it is investigating. She told the BBC: ""My personal details have been put out and I've actually had threats because of this. I got a call saying they knew where I and my family live and to get ready. ""I'm trying to do my job and I've had almost 40 calls this morning. People are phoning the surgery to complain about what's happened because it's been misinterpreted by a reporter who rang me yesterday and was really aggressive. ""It's become very upsetting. I've been on to the police this morning trying to deal with the threats. It's not nice."" She said the players and staff members were given the Pfizer vaccine, which is stored at sub-zero temperatures and has to be used up after being thawed. It comes after a thousand doses of Pfizer vaccine - worth Â£12,000 - had to be thrown away in Warwickshire because a parcel was left unrefrigerated for two-and-a-half hours. ""They are very precious vaccines and we are trying desperately not to waste them,"" said the NHS staff member who was threatened. ""They had to get there within 15 minutes or it would have gone down the drain. ""We're working 12 hours a day, seven days a week to try and get this done and all of that work has been overshadowed by this."" The National League club has provided testing facilities at its stadium during the pandemic and is in discussions about hosting a vaccination centre. The PA news agency said it understands three players and three members of staff were given vaccines, but the club has not confirmed this figure. A spokesman for the football club said: ""A small number of Chesterfield players and staff - most of whom are classed as vulnerable people - have received the Covid-19 vaccine. ""In line with the NHS directive - that doctors and staff have the discretion to ensure that they can make full use of any unused vaccines, rather than have any go to waste - the people concerned were called at very short notice to receive the vaccine. ""They were only contacted after the surgery had exhausted all other viable options.

"Last month, Highland Council's south planning applications committee approved the 4,960-home proposal without the matter going to a vote. Officers told councillors that there were no sound legal grounds to oppose the plan for Tornagrain, near Nairn. The planning, environment and development committee voted 17 to three in favour of the project. The project has already been approved in the Highland-wide development plan. Several councillors, upset by what happened at August's meeting, pushed for the developer's application for outline planning permission to be re-examined. The scheme was brought before Wednesday's planning, environment and development committee for a debate. After seeking legal advice, councillors voted on the project. Developer Moray Estates Development Company Ltd expects that the new town will eventually have a population of about 10,000. The settlement would grow over 30 to 40 years.

"MicheÃ¡l Martin told Irish broadcaster RTÃ ""trust has been eroded"" by the move by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ""The stakes are higher now because of the British action,"" he said. Critics have said the proposed Internal Market Bill, published on Wednesday, would ""tear up"" the existing withdrawal agreement. The bill proposes no new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. It gives UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. 'Outright opposition' Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin said the bill is likely to impact further negotiations. ""The publication of the bill signals an attempt by the UK government to essentially break its commitment entered into an international agreement and that is very serious,"" he said. ""I think the European Union leadership will be very concerned in how negotiations go from here."" Mr Martin said he stressed his ""outright opposition"" to the move taken in a phone call with Mr Johnson on Wednesday night. He said he pointed out very strongly it was ""dragging Northern Ireland"" back into the centre stage. He said Britain signed up to the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement and the Northern Ireland Protocol with a view to ensuring they wanted access to the European market. ""Trust has been eroded but he made it clear to me that the UK was fully committed to meeting the obligations of protecting the single market and fluidity of trade north and south. The legislation runs counter to that."" 'Don't imperil Good Friday Agreement' His comments came after US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi warned there will be ""absolutely no chance"" of a US-UK trade agreement if Brexit undermines the Good Friday Agreement. Speaker Pelosi issued a statement on Wednesday praising the Good Friday Agreement as NI's ""bedrock of peace"". She said Brexit cannot be ""allowed to imperil"" the agreement. ""The UK must respect the Northern Ireland Protocol as signed with the EU to ensure the free flow of goods across the border,"" Ms Pelosi said. ""If the UK violates that international treaty and Brexit undermines the Good Friday accord, there will be absolutely no chance of a US-UK trade agreement passing the Congress,"" she added. 'Threat to Agreement' Democratic Congressman Richard Neal told RTÃ he had raised concerns over the latest Brexit developments, and their implications for Northern Ireland, with Ms Pelosi. Congressman Neal is the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which will oversee any future US-UK trade agreement. ""I spoke to Speaker Pelosi earlier this morning about what I saw as a threat that could jeopardise the success of the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said. ""She indicated that she is consistent with my view that any threat that would reimpose a border on the island of Ireland would negate any possibility of having a free trade bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom,"" he added. 'No return of border' A foreign policy adviser to Joe Biden has said that the Democratic presidential candidate is also committed to preserving peace and stability in Northern Ireland. In a tweet responding to the latest Brexit developments, Mr Biden's adviser Antony Blinken wrote: ""As the UK and EU work out their relationship, any arrangements must protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent the return of a hard border."" ""I sincerely hope the British government upholds the rule of law and delivers on the commitments it made during Brexit negotiations, particularly in regard to the Irish border protocols,"" he added. This is not the first time that Mr Biden and other senior Democrats have voiced support for the Northern Ireland peace process. Last month, the Biden campaign held a virtual rally for Irish-American voters and Democratic Congressman Brendan Boyle told the event that the Brexit process had put hard-won peace and justice in Ireland at risk. ""We fortunately have many allies on Capitol Hill. One place that has not been an ally is the Oval Office,"" Congressman Boyle said. ""What a refreshing change it will be to have Joe Biden come this January. To have someone who supports the Good Friday Agreement and wants to protect it. Someone who is not mindlessly cheerleading for Brexit no matter the cost,"" he added. Last November, while campaigning for the Democratic nomination, Mr Biden said he cared a great deal about the Northern Ireland peace process and that he would continue to put pressure on Britain to ensure there is no return to a hard border after Brexit.",The taoiseach (Irish PM) has said he is not optimistic of a Brexit deal in light of the UK proposal to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement.

"Dominic Elliott, 23, died in March after he was taken to hospital from the world-renowned artist's house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire. The inquest in Hull heard Mr Elliott had taken cocaine, ecstasy and temazepam before he drank the liquid. Mr Hockney was in bed asleep at the time and was ""completely unaware"" of what had happened, the inquest heard. The artist's former partner, John Fitzherbert, told the hearing he drove Mr Elliott to Scarborough Hospital in the early hours of the morning. Mr Fitzherbert said that in the day leading up to the incident, he and Mr Elliott had drunk alcohol, taken cocaine and smoked cannabis. Pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd told the court that temazepam and ecstasy were also found in his body. Dr Shepherd said the acid severely burned Mr Elliott's mouth, tongue and throat before perforating his stomach. 'Jekyll and Hyde character' Mr Hockney, who was not in court, said in a statement read out at the inquest that he had been asleep in his bedroom and woke up on the morning of 17 March to be told Mr Elliott had died. The 76-year-old artist said he had gone to bed at 21:00 GMT the night before and despite seeing Mr Fitzherbert and his chief assistant, Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima, at midnight there was ""nothing out of the ordinary"". He did not see Mr Elliott before going to bed, Mr Hockney said. He said Mr Elliott and Mr Fitzherbert had been in a relationship for about four months and described how a number of people lived in his five-bedroom former guesthouse, including Mr De Lima. Mr Hockney said he had a large double bedroom where he also did portraits. He said Mr Fitzherbert had another large, self-contained room and they both led separate lives. He said he had known Mr Elliott for about 10 years and described how he helped him with all aspects of his studio work. But the artist said he only knew him ""professionally"" and he did not ""really know him in a social aspect"". 'Jumped off balcony' He said Mr Elliott sometimes drank a lot and this gave him a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character. ""I cannot comment on any of the lifestyle habits he has,"" Mr Hockney said in his statement. He said he had not been well at the time of the incident due to a mini-stroke. Mr Fitzherbert, who was present in court, described how he and Mr Elliott had spent the Friday night drinking and smoking cannabis. He said that on the Saturday morning, after Mr Hockney had left the house, Mr Elliott started laughing hysterically before jumping head first off a 9ft (3m) high internal balcony. Asked by the coroner, Professor Paul Marks, why he did this, Mr Fitzherbert replied: ""No idea"". He said Mr Elliott was not seriously hurt. ""I just saw his feet going over,"" he told the court. Mr Fitzherbert described how Mr Elliott later smoked more cannabis and they both fell asleep again together. He said he was woken by Mr Elliott in the middle of the night asking to be taken to hospital. Mr Fitzherbert told the court he found a bottle of toilet and drain cleaner in the sink but did not connect it to Mr Elliott at that time. 'Shield artist from scandal' Pathologist Dr Shepherd had told the inquest that Mr Elliott would have been in extreme pain and Mr Fitzherbert was asked repeatedly whether he noticed this as he tended to his friend. Mr Fitzherbert was also asked why he later called Mr De Lima to get him to tidy up the house. He said Mr Hockney had not been well and he wanted to ""shield him"" from any ""scandal involving drugs in his house"". Asked about why Mr Elliott did what he did, Mr Fitzherbert replied: ""I do not have any answers."" ""I think he liked living on the edge,"" he said. Mr Elliott's mother, Karen Kent, told the inquest how her son met Mr Fitzherbert at a family barbeque when he was 15 years old. It was Mr Fitzherbert who introduced him to Mr Hockney. Mr Elliott's best friend, Christopher Towland, told the court he had recently become worried about his friend's gambling. The inquest was adjourned until Friday.","David Hockney's assistant died after drinking acid at the painter's home, an inquest has heard."
"The Internal Market Bill will set out how powers currently held by the EU will be shared out after the post-Brexit transition period ends. But it has faced a backlash from senior Tories and prompted the resignation of a top civil servant. It comes as the talks over a trade deal with the EU continue in London. The Internal Market Bill could override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that secured the UK's exit from the EU in January. Ministers say it is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. 'Moral high ground' But senior Conservatives have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said the UK would ""lose the moral high ground"" if the government went through with the changes. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said: ""Our entire economy is based on the perception that people have of the UK's adherence to the rule of law."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the changes were necessary to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if the UK failed to get a free trade deal with the EU. ""The decision we've made is to put the peace process first, first and foremost as our absolute top international obligation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A former Cabinet minister, involved in putting together the Withdrawal Agreement, reacted furiously to Mr Hancock's claim. The former minister, who did not want to be named, told the BBC: ""I cannot allow anyone to get away with saying the government is doing this to protect the peace process. This does the precise opposite. ""It is about the internal market in the UK and is more likely to lead to a hard border [between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland] which will imperil the peace process."" 'Specific and limited' The permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, Sir Jonathan Jones, has resigned from his role over concerns about the government breaching its obligations under international law. In the Commons on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted the bill would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". It would allow the UK government to ""dis-apply"" the EU legal concept of ""direct effect"" - which gives EU law supremacy over UK law in areas covered by the Withdrawal Agreement - in ""certain, very tightly defined circumstances,"" he told MPs. The Scottish government, meanwhile, has said it will not consent to a change in the law along these lines, arguing that it would undermines devolution. The bill has also been attacked by the Welsh Brexit minister, Labour's Jeremy Miles, who accused the government of ""stealing powers from devolved administrations"". ""This bill is an attack on democracy and an affront to the people of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland,"" he added. Cross border trade The legislation will see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed powers in areas such as air quality and building efficiency currently regulated at EU level. It will also set up a new body - the Office for the Internal Market - to make sure standards adopted in different parts of the UK do not undermine cross-border trade. The new body will be able to issue non-binding recommendations to the UK Parliament and devolved administrations when clashes emerge. However, plans to hand UK ministers extra powers to ensure the application of customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland have prompted a row over the UK's legal obligations in its exit deal. 'Old arguments' Under the UK's withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland is due to stay part of the EU's single market for goods in a bid to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. In parallel with talks over a post-Brexit trade deal, the UK and EU are negotiating the precise nature of new customs checks that will be required. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Downing Street of ""reopening old arguments that had been settled"" and said the government should instead focus on securing a deal with the EU. Former Conservative PM Theresa May warned the legislation could damage ""trust"" in the UK over future trade deals with other states. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, called Mr Lewis's comments ""gravely concerning"". And French MEP Nathalie Loiseau said: ""The prime minister has promised to put a tiger in the tank in the negotiations. It seems for the time being he is putting an elephant in the china shop.""","The government will later publish plans which could override key elements of its Brexit deal with Brussels, in breach of international law."
"Temperatures soared to 30.6C (87.08F) in Porthmadog, Gwynedd, on Tuesday, the hottest temperature recorded in the UK. Meanwhile, Hawarden, Flintshire, was basking in heat of just under 30C (86F). The Met Office said it was the hottest day of the year so far and the highest temperatures in Wales since June 2017. And it is predicted the hot spell could continue all week, with people being warned to stay safe in the sun. Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: ""We are likely to see these temperatures continue until Saturday. ""There may be thundery conditions on Sunday with a possible return to hot weather at the beginning of next week."" But with high or very high UV levels during the warm spell, the Met Office is warning people to ""take care"" while enjoying the sunshine. It has warned people to take extra care to protect babies, children and the elderly from the rays and to protect their skin against burning. In North Wales, police have closed the A543 between Pentrefoelas and the Sportsman's Arms due to the tarmac melting in the heat - just months after it was closed due to heavy snow. In Penarth on Monday evening, coastguards and police responded to reports of 35 young people seen jumping into the water at Mount Stuart Graving Docks in Cardiff Bay. The group were advised of the dangers and asked to move on. Network Rail said it was keeping an eye on tracks across the Wales and Borders franchise, which can expand and buckle as they heat up, causing travel disruption. A spokesman said: ""If a section of track is judged to be at risk, we introduce speed restrictions - slower trains exert lower forces on the track and reduce the chance of buckling."" Welsh Water has urged people to think about their water usage, urging people not to waste water, despite there being no current concerns about availability. Meanwhile, the RSPCA urged pet owners and farmers to keep their animals cool. RSPCA Cymru Supt Martyn Hubbard said: ""There is a very serious side to keeping pets cool over summer as animals can suffer from heatstroke which could be fatal, especially if left in a hot car, conservatory or caravan. ""Pets may struggle to realise when they are too hot, so make sure they have constant access to shade and don't over exercise them in the heat. Remember if the pavement is too hot for your hand then it will be too hot for their paws.""","Wales is officially the hottest part of the UK, with a road even having to be closed due to tarmac melting - four months after it was shut due to snow."
"Hertfordshire Police was called to Ermine Street in Buntingford, Hertfordshire, at about 17:40 BST on Saturday. Daniel Neagu, 30, from Athelstone Road in Harrow, north-west London, has been charged with causing criminal damage. Magistrates heard that the houses belonged to development company McCarthy and Stone. A spokeswoman for the firm said Mr Neagu was not employed directly but worked for subcontractor Fenton. Police said they arrested a man at the scene after being called to the site of the newly built retirement homes. McCarthy and Stone said owners were due to move into the unoccupied bungalows within weeks. ""We are now awaiting a structural engineer's report, so we can plan the work required to repair or rebuild these properties,"" she said. ""We are absolutely devastated for the purchasers affected and our priority is to continue to stay in close contact with them and their families, and to ensure that any disruption is kept to a minimum."" Magistrates in Hatfield were told Mr Neagu, who appeared by videolink, was a Romanian national and had lived in the UK for three years. He was remanded in custody and will appear for a plea hearing at St Albans Crown Court on 10 September.",A builder has been accused of causing Â£4m of damage by ripping apart five new homes with a digger.
"Norfolk County Council hoped to build the incinerator at King's Lynn but plans were put on hold after political changes at County Hall. The project depended on a government grant, but ministers have decided to withdraw funding. Labour council leader George Nobbs said the decision was ""more bad news from this government for Norfolk taxpayers"". The council is already committed to the Â£500m project and must pay development partner Cory Wheelabrator compensation of up to Â£20.3m if it does not get planning permission, although extra costs could push that figure higher. Fierce opposition Cory Wheelabrator spokesman Paul Green said the company was disappointed at the decision by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to withdraw funding. ""The consortium will submit a revised project plan to Norfolk County Council in line with its contract,"" he said. On 28 October, councillors will be asked to decide whether to press ahead with the incinerator project or abandon it. The scheme has attracted fierce opposition on environmental and economic grounds. It was approved by a Conservative administration at County Hall, but the Tories lost control of the authority in May and now the majority of councillors oppose the scheme. It is also opposed by Conservative-controlled West Norfolk Council, West Norfolk MP Henry Bellingham and South West Norfolk MP Elizabeth Truss. On the funding decision, Mr Bellingham said: ""It's brilliant news for Norfolk because this project has always been the wrong technology in the wrong place at the wrong time. It should never, ever have been considered for government funding."" Ms Truss said: ""I have always argued that over Â£100m on subsiding a plant that local residents did not want is a poor use of taxpayers' money. ""I am pleased to hear that Defra has listened to these arguments."" Lord de Mauley, Defra minister, explained the decision in letters to both MPs and the council. He said the authority had breached terms and conditions under which funding was agreed. 'Not taken lightly' It failed to secure planning permission for the incinerator by this summer. The letters also said that England would meet EU landfill reduction targets by 2020 without the need for the incinerator. ""The decision has not been taken lightly and has been made on its own merits, but I recognise that it is likely to create difficulties for Norfolk County Council (NCC),"" Lord de Mauley wrote. ""We were also aware that if NCC decided not to proceed with the project in the light of this decision, it would potentially incur significant financial costs."" David Harrison, Liberal Democrat cabinet member for environment, transport, development and waste, said penalty payments could reach Â£26m, on top of the Â£66m in savings the council must make next year. ""The consequences to the Norfolk taxpayer will be severe. Services will have to be cut right to the bone,"" he said.",About Â£169m in funding for a controversial waste incinerator has been withdrawn by the government.
"Swindon Borough Council wants the government to make it easier to share information across boundaries. It said up to 46,000 children across the country are being exploited and used as ""runners"" by drug dealers. Councillor Barbara Parry's motion to ask the government for more powers received unanimous support. ""County lines"" is a tactic used by city drugs gangs to sell drugs in smaller towns and communities. Local runners - often teenagers - are used to transport the drugs using untraceable phones. The Local Democracy Reporting Service stated the motion will see the leader of the council, David Renard, write to the government asking for a national policy to be drawn up. 'Biggest problem' Ms Parry said: ""There has been an increase in county lines activity around the country. We have seen more activity here, and Swindon has the biggest problem for it in the whole of Wiltshire. ""There are up to 46,000 children across the whole of the country being exploited in this way, and it's not only disadvantaged children or teenagers of secondary school age. There are middle-class youngsters caught up in this right now, and children in primary school are also being exploited."" The council will urge the government to make policy to allow local authorities to work together to track perpetrators and victims across authority boundaries and to help develop skills and understanding on how to help children caught up by the gangs. The council's cabinet member for children, Mary Martin, will be asked to write to all Swindon schools asking them to include County Lines training for all staff as part of safeguarding training.","A council has called on authorities to work together to shut down ""the menace"" of county lines exploitation of children."
"There has been speculation that The Dandy, home to characters such as Desperate Dan, was under threat of closure because of circulation decline. DC Thomson said it was carrying out a review of its magazine business. The publisher also said the digital revolution offered it a chance to ""innovate and develop"". The Dandy, which was launched in 1937, sold about two million copies a week at the height of its popularity. But the comic's weekly circulation dipped under 8,000 last year compared with sister title the Beano's 38,000. A spokesman for DC Thomson said: ""We are carrying out a review of our magazines business to meet the challenges of the rapidly changing publishing industry. ""There are many challenges within the industry at present, but we're excited that the digital revolution has also given us an opportunity to innovate and develop. ""We're confident that future generations will continue to enjoy our much-loved products and characters.""

"Writing after the meeting, Mr Martin said the response to Covid-19 had been ""high on the agenda"", along with ""the implications of Brexit"". The meeting between representatives from both sides of the border was held virtually. The first and deputy first ministers took part in the meeting. They were joined by Irish government leaders. The NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Its last full meeting took place at the end of July. It is one of the institutions set up under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, the peace accord that is widely seen as marking the effective end of Northern Ireland's Troubles. It was the first time the body has met virtually, due to Covid-19 restrictions. The meeting comes a day after the Stormont Executive agreed to impose a new six-week lockdown in Northern Ireland, starting on 26 December. The new rules will be much stricter than what has been in place across Northern Ireland for most of the pandemic. 'Solidarity' Outlining the decisions on Thursday after the executive agreed the changes, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said if interventions were not taken now, the health service would be ""crushed in January"". Earlier this week, Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said his government was in ""solidarity with Northern Ireland"" in trying to curb the transmission of the virus. He said the Republic of Ireland would offer any help that was required, but added that he regretted there was not complete alignment between the two jurisdictions. Paramedics from the Republic of Ireland's National Ambulance Service (NAS) will be working in Northern Ireland this weekend, to help relieve pressures on the health service in NI. It is not the first time NAS ambulances have helped out in NI, they assisted during the first wave of the pandemic and also in 2019.","Discussions at Friday's North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting have been ""constructive"", Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has said"
"Some services were stopped for two days after the blaze at Dorset Council Depot in Chickerell, Dorset, on 15 November. The authority said the cost of the damage was expected to be several million pounds. Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service (DWFRS) said a short circuit in one of the vehicles started the fire. DWFRS's report concluded the blaze most likely started after high winds and heavy rain led to water entering the lorry's electrical circuits, ""causing a short circuit, igniting the internal components of the vehicle and allowing the fire to take hold"". It also noted there may also have been a lightning strike to the vehicle. At the height of the fire, 15 fire engines and additional support vehicles attended the scene. Dorset Council said it ""quickly restored"" waste collection services in Weymouth and Portland by hiring vehicles and borrowing others from elsewhere across the county. It added it was ""still working on long-term solutions to the loss of most of the waste fleet"" covering that area, as well as lorries based at Ferndown and Wareham. ""While the full cost of the incident is still unknown, our insurance arrangements cover us for such an incident,"" the council said.","A fire that destroyed 21 bin and maintenance lorries and led to the suspension of rubbish collections was accidental, a fire service has said."

"'Female Nude, 1916' by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani is on loan from the Courtauld Gallery, London. When the painting was initially shown in Paris a century ago it created a scandal. An exhibition containing it and a number of other Modigliani nudes was closed by the French police. However, the reception for the masterpiece on its first day of public display in Belfast was much warmer. ""Of all the various nudes that he did, this is one of the most important,"" one early viewer told BBC News NI. Unique painter ""It's not every day you get the opportunity of seeing something that's as famous as this is,"" another said. Among the other early visitors were a group of French tourists. Louise, who is from Paris, said she was surprised to see it in Belfast. ""It's especially interesting to see it at the time of the 'Me Too' movement,"" she said. The senior art curator at the National Museums NI, Anne Stewart, said that Modigliani, who died at the age of 35 in 1920, was a unique painter. ""He reinvented the way you paint and for us it's about technique,"" she said. ""He's very famous, he's illustrated in many magazines and posters but you need to come in and see the technique - how he paints, how he puts paint on the canvas. ""You feel that you're just coming upon this figure and there is an immediacy and a physicality that still surprises us today."" Ms Stewart also said that a local link was the reason that the painting had been loaned to the museum by the Courtauld Gallery. ""A collection was made as the result of the wonderful textile industry set up by Samuel Courtauld,"" she said. Courtauld connections ""There was a Courtauld factory in Carrickfergus and now that the gallery is closing for refurbishment they wanted to send some of the paintings back to places that had created the wealth that allowed the collection to be formed, so it's a giving back."" 'Female Nude, 1916' is also likely to one of the most valuable paintings ever to go on display in Northern Ireland. In May 2018, another nude by Modigliani - Nu couchÃ© (sur le cÃ´tÃ© gauche) - was sold for $157m (Â£117m) at Sotheby's in New York. However, as 'Female Nude, 1916' is part of the Courtauld collection it will not be sold on the art market. However, Anne Stewart said she could understand why a collector would want to possess it. ""I think Modigliani is so immediately recognisable, he painted like no other artist and you can almost understand how it's a trophy acquisition,"" she said. ""If you were a collector you would want to possess it, it's something that says a great deal about your taste and wealth that you can afford something like that."" 'Female Nude, 1916' is on display at the Ulster Museum until 28 October.",One of the 20th century's most famous paintings has gone on show at the Ulster Museum in Belfast.
"The 400-year-old painting made its way from the studio of the Florentine master to the collection of philanthropist Gwendoline Davies. Portraying an image of the Madonna, the work in the National Museum Wales collection was dismissed as a crude copy of the Italian artist's style. But experts working with BBC Four programme Britain's Lost Masterpieces have found it to be an original work. Bendor Grosvenor, co-presenter of the show, said: ""When I first saw this painting in the museum store, I was struck by the extraordinary beauty of the Madonna's face. ""Despite all the over-paint, parts of it reminded me of Botticelli's most famous painting, the Birth Of Venus. ""I'm now convinced that Botticelli played an important part in its production, and am delighted it has once more gone on public display."" The painting was bequeathed by Davies to the National Museum Cardiff, but its origins were doubted despite her belief it was a genuine Botticelli. Expert analysis revealed marks unique to his studio, as well as a small doodle believed to be made by the artist himself. Now proven to be the work of the Florentine, the painting will be displayed in Cardiff. Adam Webster, of the National Museum, said: ""The results are striking and demonstrate the crucial role that conservation plays in the proper understanding of our heritage. ""We are delighted with and grateful for the results. ""The painting now sits beautifully in our galleries and I hope fans of the series will come and enjoy this masterpiece.""

"Jurassic, Bincombe Bump, Veasta and Harriers' roundabouts were chosen by Dorset County Council after 900 local people suggested 70 possible names. Two of the new roundabouts are in the Littlemoor area and two at the southern end of Dorchester Road near Morrisons supermarket. All four names have local connections. 'Unique heritage' The Jurassic roundabout was the most popular name suggested. It refers to the rich geology of the nearby World Heritage Site coastline. Bincombe Bump roundabout is near to Iron Age burial mounds, or barrows, and near to Bincombe School. Veasta roundabout is named after a mythical sea monster said to have been seen off the coast of Weymouth since first being ""sighted"" in 1457; and Harriers' roundabout refers to the marsh harrier birds seen at the nearby RSPB nature reserve at Lodmoor. Peter Finney from Dorset County Council said: ""We felt that it was important to reflect long-standing local themes in the roundabout names. ""I think we have succeeded in having four roundabouts that represent the unique heritage of Weymouth."" The roundabout name signs will now be ordered and will take six weeks to be made. They will be put in place at the last stages of construction of the road.

"Carwyn Jones told The Guardian newspaper that people's ""sense of disengagement with Brussels"" could attach itself to London after Brexit. The UK government said it will trigger the Article 50 process on March 29. Mrs May, visiting Swansea, promised to seek the ""best possible deal"" that would work for everyone across the UK. Mr Jones told The Guardian the prime minister had a ""tin ear"" on matters of devolution. 'Dangerous path' He warned the future of the UK could be under threat if the UK government did not listen to the other administrations. ""If they are not careful, people's sense of disengagement with Brussels will simply attach itself to London,"" he said. ""They are giving the impression sometimes that they do not listen. ""And what kind of message is that to the people of Wales?"" Amid calls in Scotland for a second referendum on independence, the first minister said Wales needed to see a ""dividend"" for his government's continued support of a United Kingdom. ""Otherwise people in Wales are going to start saying, well, the government is listening to the Scots, we need to be like them,"" he said. ""And that's a dangerous path for the UK."" Last week, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced her intention to seek approval for a second independence referendum, to be held between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019. Mr Jones met Mrs May in her visit to Swansea on Monday, during which she also signed the Â£1.3bn Swansea Bay Region city deal. Following the meeting, the first minister said the talks had been ""constructive"". ""It was made clear that Welsh interventions had helped change and strengthen the UK positions on transition arrangements and on workers' rights,"" Mr Jones said. He called for more ""partnership working"" in the vein of the city deal as Article 50 approaches. Mrs May said she wanted to get ""the best possible deal for the United Kingdom that works for everyone across the United Kingdom"". She said the objectives included a ""good free trade deal"" and co-operation on matters such as security. Later in the afternoon, Mr Jones warned the assembly's constitutional and legislative affairs committee there could be Supreme Court challenges if the UK government took back powers from Europe and then decided which were to be devolved. ""I think that's wrong,"" he said. ""That's not the way we read our devolution settlement. It is the way that many in the UK government see it."" He also told the committee, meeting in Newport, that it was ""not always clear"" that the Wales Office had ""much influence"" within the UK government.","Welsh support for the UK could be in doubt if Theresa May does not listen to concerns about devolution, the first minister has warned."

"Mrs McAreavey, 27, daughter of Tyrone Gaelic football boss Mickey Harte, was found murdered in her honeymoon hotel room on the island on Monday. Avinash Treebhoowoon, 29, appeared in court on Wednesday, along with two others. Police told the BBC on Thursday he had confessed to the killing. It followed the revelation that a lawyer for Raj Theekoy, who is charged with conspiracy to murder, said his client had spoken to police and implicated the other two men.

"West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service (WYFRS) said several acres of Ilkley Moor caught fire on Saturday after a day of soaring temperatures. The fire involves moorland above White Wells in Ilkley. Bradford Council is warning walkers to keep off the moors. Crews from 10 engines remained at the scene of the blaze overnight to damp down. Originally there were 14 crews at the scene but WYFRS said it had scaled back its response to the blaze. Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ""awful scenes"" on the moor were a reminder ""of why we urgently need to tackle climate change"".

"The city council announced a Â£3.5m deal with airline Emirates to rebrand the Spinnaker Tower earlier this month. The decision upset 10,000 people who signed a petition against a branding plan as red and white are the colours of football rivals Southampton. More than 100 litres of red paint, bought in readiness for the work, will now be given away to good causes. Following ""collective feedback"", new plans show the tower painted blue and gold. Blue is the traditional colour of the city of Portsmouth and its football team. 'Laughing stock' Donna Jones, leader of Portsmouth City Council said: ""We have listened to the public and created a new blue, gold and white design that is in keeping with suggestions from residents. ""[It] gives us a unique opportunity to promote Portsmouth around the world."" She said there was ""no change at all to the financial deal"" following the U-turn. ""We wouldn't have to do any of this if we weren't so desperately short of money. We have a primary school places crisis at the moment - this money is going towards building new classrooms."" However Portsmouth's Liberal Democrat opposition said the saga had made the city the ""laughing stock of the country"". Councillor Ben Dowling said: ""It's good that the new design isn't red but we still have some fairly serious questions about the process that has taken place. ""Most Portsmouth people are asking 'why didn't we just get asked in the first place?' - someone surely would have pointed out that red wasn't the best idea."" The council said 115 litres of red paint already purchased by the airline would be made available to charities and community organisations in Hampshire. Sir Tim Clark, President of Emirates said: ""We listened to the feedback and worked with the council to adapt the designs in order to create something that Portsmouth residents will be proud of."" An application for advertising consent has been posted on the Portsmouth City Council website. It states: ""Brand logo and brand name will be adhered to the tower legs and lower ground signage base."" There are currently 13 objections to the plans on the planning site. A number of them, made before the new design was released, ask for full plans to be made available for public consultation. One states: ""As no pictorial representation accompanies this application it is impossible to judge the acceptability of what is proposed. Therefore I object."" The tower is to be called the Emirates Spinnaker Tower in time for the America's Cup World Series sailing event in July. Branding will remain in place for five years. If advertising consent is approved the council will be permitted to have branding on the tower until June 2022. The 560ft (170m) tower opened in 2005 and is owned by the council but run by a private company. It is believed a planning committee meeting is to be held on 7 July to discuss the application.",A Portsmouth landmark is to be painted blue and gold following an outcry over the use of red in the previous plan.

VisitNorway said travel to Norway from the US rose 37% between January and March compared to 2013. It said it had seen a 350% increase in visitors to its North American website compared to normal following last winter's release of Frozen. It also said the number of people searching for flights to Norway from the US rose by 153%, according to the website Flight Tracker. The airline Norwegian Air Shuttle has reported a 52% increase in passengers on routes from the US to Oslo in March 2014 compared to March last year. Figures for visits from the UK are expected to be released later this year. Frozen was influenced by Norway's landscape and also Hans Christian Andersen's story The Snow Queen.

"It follows the intervention of England's medical director in an email to his Welsh counterpart. Sir Bruce Keogh said data on rates in six Welsh hospitals was worrying but not adequate to ""form a view"". The Welsh government has already ruled out an inquiry, and that position has now been backed by the RCN leader. Tina Donnelly, the RCN's director in Wales, said she was not convinced by calls for an inquiry, and argued that it did appear to be supported by published data. ""We've got to put the patient at the centre of this, this should not be politicised,"" she said. 'Duty bound' However, speaking on BBC Radio Wales, Ms Donnelly added: ""Where there are legitimate concerns raised by the public about the care that their next-of-kin - or their nearest and dearest - have had in Welsh hospitals, we are duty bound to investigate that."" Health Minister Mark Drakeford said data for England and Wales could not be compared and claimed it was a Conservative Party attempt to ""drag the Welsh NHS through the mud"". Sir Bruce Keogh's intervention came amid heightened tensions between the governments in London and Cardiff Bay over the Welsh NHS. David Cameron has repeatedly criticised the performance of the Welsh NHS and the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay during Prime Minister's Questions. Statistics published last year by the Welsh government showed 11 out of 17 district general hospitals in Wales had higher death rates than should be expected. But the health minister has insisted that the latest published figures show an improving picture.

A Welsh government review has been ordered into the alleged neglect of Lilian Williams, an elderly patient at two of the board's hospitals, who died in 2012. Mrs Williams' son Gareth has, with others, call for the ABM board chief executive Paul Roberts to resign over the issue.

"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent Following Brexit the UK decided not to remain in Erasmus - a European Union (EU) programme that helps students study in other countries. Instead, the UK government has replaced it with a new scheme named after the mathematician Alan Turing. NI students will be able to access both the Erasmus and Turing schemes. That is because the Irish government has said it will enable students in Northern Ireland to continue to participate in Erasmus. Irish Universities Minister Simon Harris is expected to outline how that will happen in the coming months. Students from Northern Ireland will need to temporarily register with Irish higher education institutions to participate. However, on Saturday, the UK government has revealed more details of the Turing scheme. A website with funding and eligibility details has gone live to enable universities, colleges and schools to prepare applications to the programme. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis said Turing would enable students from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland to study and work abroad. He said the new scheme would boost access to overseas study. ""I look forward to continuing to engage with Northern Ireland education institutions, so that as many of our students as possible, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are able to participate in this scheme, allowing them to meet like-minded people from across the globe and enhance their employability prospects,"" he said. Overseas placements and exchanges under the Turing scheme are due to begin in September 2021. The UK government said Turing would target students from disadvantaged backgrounds. They have also set a target to recruit more international students to UK universities. However the governments in Scotland and Wales want their students to have the same continued access to Erasmus as students in Northern Ireland have.","Students, colleges and universities in Northern Ireland have been urged to take part in the UK replacement for the Erasmus scheme."
"By Elise JenkinsBBC News That is because the shopfront of Facefood in Roath bears a striking resemblance to Facebook's logo. The manager of Facefood said many people had been taking pictures of the distinctive facade, but confirmed his business had not approached the rather larger social network website. Facebook has confirmed it is examining the use of the sign. Facefood opened only this week in City Road, but pictures of its logo have already excited lots of comment on social networks, including Twitter. One tweeter speculated on whether Facebook would be in touch with Facefood, some found its branding funny, while others wondered if it was part of a chain. Facefood manager Samir Bougaci, who is originally from Algeria and who now lives in Cardiff, said the business had not sought permission from Facebook. ""We have not spoken with Facebook - we have not heard from them,"" he said. Mr Bougaci said he and his business partner did not believe there would be ramifications as a result of adopting the design. He said they had heard of different shops around the world along similar lines. A quick internet search reveals a number of shops also called Facefood in different countries, such as the United States, Egypt, France, Syria and Germany which also use a similar logo. ""It's different from Facebook, it's different words,"" he said. Mr Bougaci said the idea had come to them last January and developed the idea from then. Mr Bougaci, who is also the patisserie chef and trained in Algeria and France, said: ""Lots of people have been interested and they have been coming in and taking pictures."" He added: ""Business has been OK. Lots of people have been coming in. ""It cost a lot of money to get everything, the signs."" A Facebook spokesman told BBC Wales: ""We're looking into it,"" but would not comment further. Since Facebook was founded in 2004 it has become a multibillion-dollar corporation. Chief executive and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg reported last month that the site now has more than one billion people worldwide using it every month.","The sign outside one juice bar and patisserie in a Cardiff suburb is new, but seems strangely familiar."
"By Bethan LewisBBC Wales education correspondent Campaigners say employing classroom cover through agencies has led to lower pay and poorer terms and conditions. There are about 4,500 supply teachers in Wales, covering for sickness absence and professional development. One leading agency denied taking an excessive cut and said it gave teachers ""regular and consistent work"". Llyr Gruffydd AM, Plaid Cymru's education spokesman, said he had been approached ""by a number of very demoralised supply teachers"". One could only find supply work in Denbighshire through an agency and this left her Â£115 a day pay reduced to Â£85. ""Another is considering giving up a job he's done for 18 years because of the drastic cut in pay and lack of any personal development or pension payments,"" he said. Another supply teacher said after nearly 20 years he feels he will be forced to leave. ""What was wrong with the previous system whereby schools worked with supply staff directly and paid teachers properly without exploiting them? It was very simple and worked for decades."" The issue has been raised before in recent years but the campaign group Fair Deal for Supply Teachers is now organising a lobby outside the Assembly next Wednesday. ""Welsh supply teachers are fed up with delays, prevarication, inquiries and reports,"" said a spokesman. CASE STUDY Angela Sandles, a former nurse, from Monmouthshire, qualified as a primary school teacher in 1999 and worked in Blaenau Gwent for 12 years. She has been a supply teacher for the last six years, so she could also spend time as a foster parent. ""It's far different from classroom teaching. Some experiences can be fantastic, everything is laid out for you. But you can get a call late in the day, you might not have any work left for you, you have to think on your feet. It's not for the faint hearted but it's enjoyable because we only do this job because we care passionately about education."" She said most supply teachers in Wales were now employed via agencies rather than directly by local authorities. After deductions she said she could be paid around the minimum wage. Ms Sandles described the situation as ""diabolical"" and said some supply teachers were turning to pizza delivery to make ends meet. ""Supply teachers are voting with their feet and leaving and looking for alternative employment,"" she said. ""There are lack of opportunities to be paid properly, get proper continuous professional development and a broad spectrum of experience in schools. Newly qualified teachers are being signed up to agencies and guaranteed work. But once they work for an agency they find it hard to gain the broad range of experience schools are looking for. ""I'm coming up to retirement shortly but I'm fighting for younger teachers who need to be looked after. ""Wales should look to Northern Ireland where supply teachers are on a central register, and get them to be paid, if not initially to scale, but at least the Â£135 [a day] minimum that the agency is charging to a school. Give us that money. We can fill out our own own self-assessment form and do tax and national insurance."" Mr Gruffydd said it is two years since an Assembly committee recommended a more strategic all-Wales approach for supply teachers, based on Northern Ireland's system. He wants a not-for-profit agency with more money going directly to teachers. New Directions has a three-year contract until next summer as a preferred source of supply teachers for 22 councils, but more than 50 different agencies are operating. Gary Williams, director of New Directions, which has 3,135 teachers on its books in Wales, said they provide regular, consistent work and a guaranteed payment scheme for up to 150 days a year. He denied the agency took a 30-40% cut. ""We provide teachers with training and regular work. Why they have concerns about this system I don't know,"" said Mr Williams. ""We've been here for over 20 years and thousands of supply teachers have worked for agencies. We have head teachers now who worked for agencies back in the day."" The Welsh Government said school governors had the flexibility to decide how best to meet their staffing and supply needs. ""There is nothing to prevent schools from directly employing supply teachers,"" said a spokesman. He said they were examining the findings of an independent taskforce and working closely with teachers and unions to develop proposals to implement the recommendations.","Supply teachers are having to take on extra jobs to make ends meet and many are considering quitting the profession, it has been claimed."

"Nearly 200,000 more people were in the centre this year compared to last, taking the total to nearly nine million - 1.5 million more than predicted. It comes despite fears that shoppers would leave the city because some high street names have closed stores. Experts say the rise could be due to new homes, offices and a university campus being built in the area. According to the council's service plan indicators and targets, footfall for Newport city centre stood at 8,939,472 in the year 2011/2012. That is a rise of 192,638 on the year 2010/2011 and 1,504,633 more than the council predicted for 2011/2012. It follows figures from the National High Street Index which show a 7.6% rise in the number of people in Newport City Centre this June compared to last. According to this study Cardiff saw a 1.6% drop - and Swansea a 4.5% drop. James Urquhart, the co-owner of Total Toys, has moved from a stall in the city's indoor market to a bigger shop on the high street because of the rise in footfall. ""We're seeing a bit of an increase because we're seeing more shops re-opening,"" he said. ""One of the people down town, called Missy, he shut for a while but now he's back. Obviously for him to come back there must be an increase - he was talking about going to Cwmbran, but he's come back to Newport as well"". 'City landscape changing' It is difficult to pinpoint any one reason for the rise in footfall, but some experts believe it may, in part, be down to new housing in the centre, professional services relocating to the city and the new University of Wales Newport campus on the banks of the River Usk. Dr Jonathan Deacon, a reader in Marketing and Entrepreneurship at the University of Wales Newport says the city landscape is changing. He said: ""We have to rethink and redesign what our city centres are all about - and the city centre of Newport has taken a brave step in saying that maybe it's not just about retail, that it's not just about office space - it's about this kind of mixed activity, so dwelling spaces as well as commercial spaces"". The rise in footfall comes after fears that Newport was losing shoppers to other shopping centres in nearby Cardiff and Bristol, along with Cwmbran, where there is an out-of-town retail park. Big high street names, including Marks and Spencer, Next, Burton and Topshop, all shut stores in the city centre last year. But in March it was announced that plans to revamp Newport's shopping centre with the Friars Walk development for John Frost Square had been approved. Work is likely to start on the Â£100m development next year to create a new shopping centre and a department store, along with a six-screen cinema, eight restaurants and cafe. A car park with 360 spaces is included in the plan.","The number of people passing through Newport city centre has risen ""significantly,"" council figures show."

It also plans to open up more of the historic walls around Denbigh, giving access to walkers, and providing guided tours. The castle is due to close next month to allow work to get under way. Work on the castle began soon after Edward I created the Lordship of Denbigh, which he granted to Henry de Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln, in 1282. Much of the castle, the town walls, and other historic features still remain, according to county archaeologist Fiona Gale. From next February when the castle reopens, Cadw wants to make the building a ""key heritage visitor attraction"", according to Heritage Minister Huw Lewis.

"Katrina Percy first stepped down in August, but was given a new advisory role specifically created for her. The Trust's board said public feedback had led it to decide it was ""no longer possible for her to continue"". Ms Percy, who will leave with a Â£190,000 payout, said she felt ""great sadness"" but agreed with the decision. The public response, she said, had caused her to reflect and decide to ""leave the trust with immediate effect and seek other opportunities"". On the subject of Ms Percy's settlement, NHS Improvement said: ""We know that this won't please some who think she ought to have received no payment at all. ""In situations like this, a perfect deal is not possible. ""But the strong legal advice we have received is that to do anything else would have a much greater cost to the public purse and, as a consequence, would go against good management of public money."" 'Public concern' A Southern Health spokesman said it was looking to pass on her duties, which involved giving strategic advice to GPs, ""sooner rather than later"". The ""important work"" could be shared among several of the trust's GPs, he suggested. Ms Percy had stepped down from her previous role as chief of Southern Health amid ""media attention"" after the trust failed to investigate hundreds of deaths. Despite resigning as CEO after months of pressure, Ms Percy was controversially retained as an advisor on her existing pay and benefits package of nearly Â£250,000 a year. The interim chairman of the trust admitted to BBC News at the time no other candidates had been considered, but said it was a ""finite role for a 12-month period"". He resigned his post three weeks later. Southern Health's board said it had ""received correspondence from the public, patients and families expressing their concerns"". ""Both the Trust and NHS Improvement believe it is no longer possible for Katrina to continue in her new advisory role,"" it said. ""Katrina shares this view and we have worked with NHS Improvement to come to a settlement where she will leave Southern Health with immediate effect, to pursue other opportunities."" Ms Percy faced months of criticism for the way her trust failed to investigate patient deaths when she was chief executive. In June, the trust accepted responsibility for the death of 18-year-old Connor Sparrowhawk, who drowned in a bath at Slade House in Oxford. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest, which has supported Connor Sparrowhawk's family, said the resignation ""should mark the end of Southern Health's denial of responsibility for systemic failings and the start of vital work to protect the lives of the people in its care"". But campaign group Justice for LB - LB was Connor's nickname, and stands for Laughing Boy - called the settlement ""utterly disgraceful"". ""We listened to feedback, reflected, decided she wasn't employable and rewarded her with quarter of a million,"" it tweeted.","The former head of troubled Southern Health NHS trust, who was controversially moved to a new post, has quit following months of pressure."
"The Labour leader told the BBC the way decisions were taken in the party after his re-election had to be opened up. He also sought to build bridges with MPs critical of him by saying the ""vast majority"" have no fear of being barred from standing at the next election. It came as one union leader told MPs to stop ""knifing"" their leader. Unite boss Len McCluskey said he believed ""only a rump of right wingers"" would continue to oppose Mr Corbyn following his re-election and he should be allowed to lead without having ""to pluck knives out of his back."" Speaking to the Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn acknowledged there were ""differences of opinion"" between him and many of his MPs on policy but said there was also a ""great deal of unanimity"". 'Thirst for change' He said Labour's growing party membership - which has swelled to more than half a million since the general election - now held greater sway and Labour MPs would be expected to fall into line with its support for a tough message on anti-austerity and public ownership. But he played down talk that MPs judged to be out of step with the direction of the party could be deselected in the run-up to next general election. MPs have warned of a purge linked to proposed changes to constituency boundaries in 2020 and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has warned that, if this happened, it could lead to a split in the party similar to the one in the early 1980s. Mr Corbyn said the relationship between an MP and their constituency was ""complex"" but added: ""Let's have a democratic discussion and, I think, the vast majority of MPs will have no problem whatsoever."" Mr Corbyn said he wanted a less top-down approach to policy making, with more input from grass roots activists and the party conference, which began in Liverpool on Sunday, at the ""centre of concluding policy debates"". ""There is a lot of thirst for change out there,"" he said. ""People want to see things done differently."" After Mr Corbyn secured 61.8% of the vote to comfortably defeat his challenger Owen Smith, there has been speculation that a number of Labour MPs who resigned from the shadow cabinet in the summer in protest at Mr Corbyn's leadership could be willing to return. Mr McCluskey said the majority of MPs would now be willing to serve under Mr Corbyn and the media should ""watch this space"". But former shadow health and education secretaries Heidi Alexander and Tristram Hunt have already ruled out a return to the front bench and Mr Smith has also said he won't serve under his rival. It is thought a number of MPs are only prepared to return if elections to the shadow cabinet - which were scrapped in 2011 - are reinstated. Labour's ruling National Executive Committee discussed the issue on Saturday but no conclusions were reached. 'Greater good' Amid calls for unity, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said it was time for opponents of Mr Corbyn to fall in line, telling the BBC News Channel they needed to work for the ""greater good"" by providing a strong opposition. She was speaking after Labour peer Lord Mitchell became the first representative to quit the party after Mr Corbyn's re-election. The businessman, who was ennobled by Tony Blair in 2000, said he was concerned about Mr Corbyn's ""lack of leadership qualities"" and he would never become prime minister. The peer also said he was alarmed by the rise of anti-Semitism within sections of the Labour movement and Mr Corbyn's ""lukewarm"" response to it. In response, Mr Corbyn said the comments were ""unfortunate"" and there is ""absolute unity in the party of opposing any form of anti-Semitism"". Winning mandate In his first set piece interview since his re-election, Mr Corbyn told Andrew Marr he supported a huge programme of public investment in the economy, funded by extra borrowing and an increase in corporate taxation. He also called on the government to be more open about the progress of the Brexit negotiations amid confusion about when Article 50 would be triggered. While supporting the current defence budget, he appeared to cast doubt on plans by MI6 to recruit 1,000 extra staff, saying the security service's proposed expansion wasn't ""particularly necessary"". On foreign policy, he said there should be an inquiry into Russian bombing in Syria and also suggested British troops should not be protected from future legal action over alleged abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan - after calls for an end to ""vexatious"" claims by PM Theresa May. This, he said, would be a ""step too far"" as British soldiers had to respect international law. Conservative Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson suggested that Mr Corbyn did not pose a serious threat to the government, telling Andrew Marr his ""left-wing 1970s"" economic programme was ""extremely dangerous"".","Jeremy Corbyn has vowed to give more say over policy-making to grass-roots Labour supporters to help build a ""more equal and decent society""."
"Chief executive Karl Koehler said the changes were vital if the company was to remain competitive. He pointed to the UK's high business rates and ""uncompetitive"" energy costs as factors in the decision. In 2012, 600 jobs went from Tata sites in Wales. It still has 7,000 staff with just over half working at Port Talbot. The Welsh government said the news would be of concern to Tata staff, but was encouraged that the company planned to make the redundancies through voluntary means. A consultation process lasting at least 45 days will begin shortly. 'Competitive future' The company said in statement the job losses would reduce costs and enable it to compete in an era of lower market demand. Mr Koehler said: ""Steel demand and prices are likely to be under pressure for some years. Our business rates in the UK are much higher than other EU countries' and our UK energy costs will remain uncompetitive until new mitigation measures come into effect. ""These proposed changes then are vital if we are to build a competitive future for our strip products business in the UK."" The company spends Â£60m on electricity in Wales alone, and pays about 40% more for the electricity than competitors in continental Europe. The government introduced measures in the last budget to reduce energy costs for heavy industries but they do not come into force until 2016. Mr Koehler said they would do everything possible to support staff ""through this unsettling time"". He added the company had invested over Â£250m in the past two years in state-of-the-art technology and were making further investments in its hot strip mill in Port Talbot and at a site in Llanwern in Newport. UK Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""This is understandably a difficult time for the workforce at Tata Steel in south Wales as the company tries to weather challenging market conditions. ""I have been in close contact with the chief executive at Tata Steel and understand they will offer voluntary redundancy packages and cross match people to other parts of the business to try and avoid compulsory job losses."" Councillor Peter Rees, deputy leader of Neath Port Talbot council, said: ""Whilst we appreciate that the steel industry is under pressure and accept Tata's need to remain competitive, this announcement is a bitter blow for the local community and south Wales."" He said the council would help workers find alternative employment and help those considering setting up their own business. Tata Steel in Wales Tata employs around 7,000 people across Wales. A total of 3,800 people work at Port Talbot, meaning just over 10% of staff there will lose their jobs. In Newport, 600 are employed at Llanwern and 350 at the Orb Electrical Steelworks. Trostre in Llanelli employs 750, while the site at Shotton in Flintshire has 850 working there. 'Concerns' Roy Rickhuss, chair of the UK trade unions' steel committee, said they were very concerned at the news and would do ""all we can to support those affected by the announcement"". He added: ""We recognise the company has been dealing with a long-term downturn in European steel markets for more than five years. ""However we have also expressed our own concerns about possible under-manning within strip products and in Port Talbot in particular. ""Therefore, it is vital that this is not just an exercise to just reduce costs by cutting jobs but takes a considered and objective view as to the numbers required to run and maintain the plant to make steel safely and productively."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""Tata has demonstrated its commitment to Wales by investing nearly Â£400m in the strip business over the past two years. Despite this investment it is clear that the industry is still being adversely affected by high energy costs in the UK. ""We continue to work with Tata to ensure we create and sustain a thriving steel industry in Wales but repeat our calls for the UK government to implement measures to reduce the burden faced by energy intensive companies in Wales."" Welsh Secretary David Jones said: ""It is very disappointing to hear that Tata Steel has had to make the decision to reduce its operational workforce at its Port Talbot site and my immediate concerns are with those employees and their families who may be potentially affected by redundancies."" In a joint statement Aberavon Labour MP Hywel Francis MP and David Rees AM said: ""We were assured that the usual process of consultation will be undertaken and key issues of long term sustainability of the plant and safety will be paramount."" Liberal Democrat AM Peter Black called the announcement sad news for the workers. ""The Welsh government needs to act quickly so those workers who are facing redundancy will know what options are available to them,"" he said. Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said it was concerning, adding: "" In difficult global economic circumstances it is important that Welsh government is able to listen and respond to companies' needs and demands, such as through business rates support.""","Around 400 jobs are to go at the Tata steelmaking plant in Port Talbot, the company has announced."
"Routes across London, Kent, East Sussex, Lancashire, Essex and Glasgow are among the lines to be shut. Network Rail, which controls the UK's railways, says 95% of the network will be unaffected and it is the least disruptive time to do this work. Bus replacements are planned but journey times are likely to increase. London Paddington will be closed for four days between Christmas Eve and 27 December with Great Western Railway advising passengers to travel by 23 December ""at the latest"". Between 23 December and 1 January, there will be no Greater Anglia trains between London Liverpool Street and Ingatestone or Billericay. Elsewhere, buses will replace trains between Preston and Lancaster from Christmas Eve until 27 December. Over this period, those travelling between London and Glasgow will also face longer journey times as passengers are advised to go via Edinburgh. Southeastern trains will not be running to London Bridge, Charing Cross or Cannon Street from 23 December to 1 January. Network Rail's chief executive Mark Carne said most of the network is open for ""business as usual"" but some routes will be ""heavily affected"". He strongly advised passengers to plan ahead this Christmas. ""We know that our railway is up to 50% quieter than usual during the festive period, so taking on and delivering these huge transformational schemes at this time of year minimises our impact on passengers.""","Rail passengers are being advised to travel earlier to avoid disruption over the Christmas period, with more than 200 sets of engineering works planned."
"Rapid test kits will be provided twice a week to pupils and anyone in their household or support bubble regardless of whether they have symptoms. They will also be available to adults who work with schools, such as bus drivers and after-school club leaders. Meanwhile, nearly two million people aged 60 to 63 in England are being invited to book their vaccine. From Monday, people in that age bracket will start receiving letters explaining how to book a jab through the national booking service, NHS England said. Nearly 20 million people in the UK have now received their first dose, with the government aiming to offer a first dose to all adults by the end of July. Asked whether vaccine passports or certificates should be used to help open up the economy once this point was reached Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr this threw up ""complicated, ethical issues"". However, he said the idea could be ""relevant"" for ""reopening parts of our country like mass events"" and that a government review was under way. The chancellor said the rapid progress of the vaccination rollout did not mean coronavirus restrictions could be eased earlier than set out in the prime minister's roadmap and he could not ""guarantee"" there would be no further lockdowns. He said he had seen no signs that new variants of the virus were circulating in the country despite cases rising in some parts of England - but stressed it was important people continued following lockdown rules. Home testing for secondary pupils will be twice weekly, with parents expected to carry out the testing at home after three tests in school. They will be encouraged but not mandatory, with pupils from year one upwards able to take a test, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Tests will also be available to nursery school staff, the DHSC said. Public Health England said testing would help ""uncover hidden cases"" and break chains of transmission and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would ""provide yet another layer of reassurance to parents and education staff that schools are as safe as possible"". Tests will be available in-person via workplace testing, at local authority testing sites or through a new ordering service that will allow people to order the kits online to collect. Anyone who tests positive will need a secondary PCR test to confirm the result of their home test. Meanwhile, more than three in four people aged between 65 and 70 have now taken up the offer of a vaccine, NHS England said. Last week, invites began to be sent out to 64-year-olds and those aged 50 to 60 are set to be invited ""shortly"", the NHS added. It said the vaccine rollout was gaining ""fresh momentum"", with medical director Prof Stephen Powis urging anyone who has been invited to take up the offer. ""It doesn't matter when you were invited you can still come forward and protect yourself and others,"" he said. The vaccine supplies are expected to increase in March, said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England chief executive. ""We're planning for further acceleration as we head towards Easter."" People can use the national booking service to reserve a slot at NHS vaccination centres or at pharmacies. Those who cannot go online can call 119 free of charge. NHS teams are also visiting those who cannot travel to a vaccination service. BAME plea It comes as leaders from 60 black-majority churches in the UK issued a call to their congregations on Sunday to get the vaccine, urging worshippers to seek out the facts about the vaccine from trusted sources. Data has suggested people from black and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are being vaccinated at much lower rates than white people. The Bishop of Dover, the Right Reverend Rose Hudson-Wilkin, who is among the alliance of Christian leaders, said: ""Don't let misinformation rob you of your opportunity to protect yourself and others."" The Duke of Cambridge has also urged people to get vaccinated. According to the government's latest figures, more than 19.6 million people in the UK have now received their first dose - equivalent to more than one in three adults. The number of people who have had their second jab has risen to 768,810.

"The club, formed in 1856, created a set of 10 laws known as ""Cambridge Rules"". These helped formalise the game and ""elements"" of them appear in the Football Association (FA) rules drawn up in 1863, the FA said. The university said the National Football Museum award recognised its ""pivotal role"" in football history. Before club members drew up their original rules, players around the country posted up makeshift versions at playing fields and agreed to stick to them before the game began. More news from Cambridgeshire This often resulted in unruly games, widespread disagreements and frequent brawls. Cambridge University Football Club's founders Henry De Winton and John Charles Thring are believed to have formed the club in 1846 but the first official record of its name and rules date from 1856. Dr John Little, president of the modern-day Cambridge University Football Club, said: ""In Cambridge it was decided it would be better if one set of rules was agreed on, so that everyone could play against each other."" Known as the ""Cambridge rules"" they were pinned on trees on the city's large public playing field, Parker's Piece. The club now claims ""unofficially"" to be the ""oldest club in the world still playing,"" the university said. Although Sheffield FC, founded in 1857, is recognised as the oldest club by the Football Association, CUAFC was given a plaque in 2006 by the FA in honour of its 150th anniversary, ""giving its foundation date official recognition"".

"Under the proposals, the current Asda supermarket would be redeveloped and new shops, cafes and restaurants built on the Red Oak car park site. Plans by developers Sovereign Land also include the building of a hotel and leisure complex in Central Square. It said it would complement the Â£250m Southwater scheme, which is being built by Telford and Wrekin Council and leisure developers Citigrove. Sovereign said it was holding a three-day consultation event in the shopping centre, from Thursday. Work could start next Spring, once Asda had relocated to its new store on the old civic offices site, it said. Telford and Wrekin council has given its backing to the plans. Council leader Kuldip Sahota said: ""It's a very exciting time and these ideas, subject to planning approval, would give Telford a mix of leisure and retail that most destinations would die for.""",Plans for a Â£200m revamp of Telford Shopping Centre have been revealed.
"A report by Scottish Enterprise pointed to a number of major field developments which were under way or planned. It said a total of Â£44bn in capital expenditure was expected to be invested in the sector between 2012 and 2016. The agency also identified 86 new fields which were under development, or on which work could begin by 2016. These included the Â£2.5bn development of the Laggan and Tormore gas/condensation fields in the West of Shetland area. In addition, major new investments were under way on 12 existing fields, such as Forties and Schiehallion. Scottish Enterprise's Spends and Trends report 2012-2016 said these developments would in turn ""create significant opportunities for new contracts for the supply chain"". David Rennie, director of oil and gas at Scottish Enterprise, said: ""We know that the remaining recoverable resources on the UK Continental Shelf should ensure production for decades to come and the high level of activity, as set out in this report, will create significant opportunities for companies in the sector. ""The industry-led Oil and Gas Strategy has already highlighted the importance of the sector for the Scottish economy, and the development of a number of new and existing fields play a key role in this."" Energy Minister Fergus Ewing said the report clearly demonstrated the vast potential of the oil and gas sector in Scotland. He added: ""With more than half of the value of the North Sea's oil and gas reserves yet to be extracted, up to 24 billion recoverable barrels with a potential wholesale value of Â£1.5 trillion, I am sure the sector will remain an enormous economic resource for decades to come.""","Prospects for the oil and gas sector in the UK Continental Shelf ""remain strong"" over the next five years, new analysis has suggested."
"Helen & Douglas House in Oxford employs 149 staff and provides specialist palliative care for the terminally ill from children to adults aged 35. But Elizabeth Drew, chair of the trustees, said the organisation had to adopt a ""prudent approach to reduce the service in line with what we can afford in order to keep the hospice open"". The changes will take effect in August. The hospice estimated its income over the last five years was Â£52.3m, against costs of Â£55.9 million. A spokeswoman said it was overspending by about Â£1m each year, and would run out of money in two years if changes were not made. As well as carrying out a review of its 37 charity shops it will also make cuts around the senior leadership team. It blames a ""challenging and highly competitive fundraising environment"". Ms Drew said: ""We have been working for some time to reduce our operating costs and despite savings made last year we reluctantly conclude that these were not sufficient to sustain the organisation for the long term."" She added: ""The changes we are about to make will ensure the charity is able to provide specialist palliative care to terminally ill children, young people and their families for decades to come. ""We are confident that this places the organisation on a firm foundation from where it can evolve to meet the emerging needs of our young patients."" The charity said it would help find alternative arrangements for the young adults and families currently in its care.

"Blackpool Council said it was the first local authority to use AI technology to detect damage to roads. It uses satellite images to inspect roads in seconds rather than sending engineers, and was trialled in Anchorsholme and Bispham. The earlier detection of potholes means repair costs can be lowered. The technology, piloted in summer and now rolled out permanently, detects the damage before using a traffic light colour-coding system to determine what action should be taken. The council said 5,145 potholes had been fixed in North Shore at a cost of just under Â£450,000, which would have cost Â£1.5m using traditional methods. 'Significant savings' The savings will be used to improve more roads, the authority added. Councillor Fred Jackson, cabinet member responsible for highways, said the project would deliver ""significant savings"" and benefit all road users. He added: ""Blackpool Council is on a dynamic journey to deliver a better Blackpool and drive regeneration. More efficient road maintenance technology can play a key part of that ambition."" Steve Berry, head of local roads at the Department for Transport, said: ""We hope Project Amber will act as a showcase of what can be achieved by local authorities working in partnership with the supply chain to achieve lower whole life costs in highway maintenance through the use of surface treatments.""","An innovative pilot scheme using artificial intelligence to assess potholes has saved more than Â£1m of taxpayers' cash, a council has said."
"The Kent airport closed last May, seven months after being bought by Ann Gloag, co-founder of the Stagecoach Group. She subsequently sold a majority stake of the 700-acre site to regeneration specialists for redevelopment. The Commons Transport Select Committee said Mrs Gloag should make clear who would benefit from any redevelopment. A spokeswoman for Mrs Gloag said she would not be commenting on the MPs' report into smaller airports, which follows evidence given to the select committee in February. In a statement, regeneration specialists Chris Musgrave and Trevor Cartner said the stake they had bought ""gives us a controlling interest, and future redevelopment rests with us"". ""Mrs Gloag's stake in no way gives her control over the site or the joint venture company, though she will benefit from the successful redevelopment."" Mr Musgrave and Mr Cartner said their interest was ""solely in redeveloping the site for the benefit of the local economy"". ""The fact remains Manston Airport, as pointed out in the MPs' report, has not proved economically viable despite the millions spent to make it a success,"" they added. 'Public uncertainty' Campaigners fighting to keep the airport open petitioned Thanet District Council following its closure asking it to compulsorily purchase the site. In December, the council considered a compulsory purchase order (CPO) involving US investment firm RiverOak as the indemnity partner, but decided not to proceed with it. However, in the select committee report, MPs said Kent County Council (KCC) should have done more to support Thanet as it considered the CPO. They said KCC had failed to fulfil its ""strategic oversight function as the local transport authority"". KCC leader Paul Carter said the authority ""worked very closely with the district council"". ""I've read the details of what we said we'd do and we've done everything we could possibly have done in helping and supporting Thanet District Council."" He said the Thanet-commissioned study into Manston concluded that unless the owners had Â£100m to start off with, the viability of the airport would always be ""enormously challenging"". ""What I would like to see is the owners of Manston Airport creating significant employment opportunities for the people of east Kent and helping to support and grow the east Kent economy,"" he added. 'Pulled rug out' Conservative MP for North Thanet Sir Roger Gale, who is in favour of keeping Manston open, said the select committee had ""absolutely got a point"" and criticised Mr Carter. ""The county council passed a resolution unanimously supporting the airport and Thanet council in its endeavours to go for a CPO. ""Fairly shortly after that, the leader of Kent County Council pulled the rug out from under Thanet."" Sir Roger claimed Mr Carter was ""distracted by the possibility of a development site"". Earlier this month, a government review was ordered into the decision not to go ahead with the CPO. The committee concluded that although welcoming the decision, ""the uncertainty faced by the public and other interested parties could have been reduced if it had not taken three months before the Department for Transport acted"".",The former owner of Manston Airport has been told by MPs to make details of her deal with its new owners public to counter claims of asset stripping.
"By Joey D'Urso & Daniel Kraemer BBC News Parliament's register of interests shows that Boris Johnson has received far more than the others. The data also shows how much money MPs have earned on top of their Â£79,000 salary, and Mr Johnson is way ahead of his rivals on this as well. What are the rules? MPs must declare any money that someone might ""reasonably consider to influence their actions or words as an MP"". The amounts details of donors are published in the Register of Members' Financial Interests every two weeks. What do we know? Since the leadership campaign kicked off, the hopefuls have registered a flurry of direct donations. The vast majority of this money is to fund leadership campaigns, though a small element of each total may be for a local party or other activities. Mr Johnson is way out in front for these kinds of donations, raking in almost a quarter of a million pounds since October. More than Â£50,000 of his donations this year has come from machine manufacturer JCB, as well as Â£20,000 from the company's chairman, Lord Bamford. The biggest single donation to leadership candidates since the election was from Jonathan Wood - a hedge fund manager - who gave Mr Johnson Â£25,000 last month, and Â£50,000 for office and staffing costs last October. Jeremy Hunt received Â£10,000 from Andrew Law, another hedge fund manager recently valued at Â£485m, who has given the Conservative Party more than Â£150m in the last four years. The next day, Mr Law gave Sajid Javid Â£10,000. Speeches and writing The register of interests also gives information about money that MPs have earned on top of their basic salary. Lots of parliamentarians make money from writing, making speeches at private events, or doing consultancy work for businesses. BBC analysis of the register of interests since the 2017 general election shows that Mr Johnson has earned far more than anyone else. Several candidates have had outside earnings of zero over the past two years because they have been ministers for all of this time. Until recently Mark Harper, a trained accountant, was earning Â£3,000 per month for advising a law firm. Rory Stewart earned money from book royalties and Dominic Raab from newspaper columns. But nobody's earnings come anywhere close to Mr Johnson's - since resigning as foreign secretary in July 2018 he has received Â£23,000 per month for a weekly column in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, and Â£73,000 for books and articles. His biggest source of income is eight speeches he has made at private events over the past few months. Boris Johnson paid speeches since November 2018 What about ministers? There are strict rules for ministers and outside employment - Mr Johnson's surge in extra earnings began when he left the Foreign Office last summer. Michael Gove has been in the cabinet since the last election, so has had no outside earnings. But during his time on the backbenches between July 2016 and June 2017, he made almost Â£150,000 on top of his MP salary, for work including speeches and a weekly column for the Times newspaper. Cabinet ministers are entitled to more than Â£70,000 on top of their MP salary of Â£79,468. How much can they spend? According to a leaked document obtained by Sky News, the Conservative Party is imposing a spending limit of Â£150,000 during the campaign. However, this only covers money spent since the campaign officially got under way on Friday. Anything earlier than this, such as Â£56,000 spent on Facebook adverts last week by the Dominic Raab campaign, does not count. In an election campaign there are legal limits on spending, monitored closely by the Electoral Commission, with expenditure published online. In the Conservative leadership race, any limit is imposed by the party.",In recent weeks the candidates to become Conservative leader - and prime minister - have collected tens of thousands of pounds in campaign donations.
"The prime minister hosted the meeting at the Aston Martin car factory at St Athan, Vale of Glamorgan. With a year to go before Brexit, she told BBC Wales: ""The sense that I get is that people are coming together."" Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones said Brexit ""has to happen"" but done in a ""sensible"" rather than ""crazy"" way"" Mrs May was in St Athan as part of her whistle-stop around the UK to mark one year to go until Brexit. She told BBC Wales' political editor Nick Servini: ""What I've been doing today in the four nations of the United Kingdom is hearing from people, from businesses, from mothers, from farmers, hearing about their hopes for Brexit, hearing about the issues they want to raise with me but also hearing about the opportunities that will come to the UK when we leave the EU. ""It's not just about getting the right trade deal with the EU - it's also about ensuring that we can take the opportunities for trade around the rest of the world that will open up to us. ""We're getting on with it and that's my message to the European Union,"" Mrs May added. Asked if people were still deeply divided over Brexit, she said: ""I think they see now ... that we need to ensure that we have got the right arrangements in place, that we've negotiated that good trade deal and that people can see certainty for jobs and prosperity here in the UK, but also that we are taking the opportunities around the rest of the world."" First Minister Carwyn Jones told BBC Wales: ""Brexit has to happen. The question now is whether it is done in a completely crazy way or is it done in a sensible way. For me, it's got to be sensible."" He said the ""crazy"" way would be ""leaving very quickly, no deal with the European Union, no access to the EU single market, leaving the customs union and then disappearing hoping that the world will give us living"". ""We need to make sure that we have the best relations that we have with our closest and most important market. If we ignore that then nothing else will replace it,"" Mr Jones said. ""That means farmers will suffer and jobs will suffer. We don't need to do that."" He added: ""We can leave the EU - we can do it in a way that is sensible not one that exists in the realms of fantasy which some in the Conservative Party and in UKIP, that's the world they are living in.""",Theresa May has said she is committed to making Brexit a success after meeting south Wales business leaders as part of a UK tour.
"Charges vary but the average cost in England is Â£39 per week. Carers, visitors and staff have been sharing their experience with the BBC. Here is a selection: John West in Melton, Suffolk: During the last five weeks my mother-in-law has spent 12 days in Ipswich hospital. She is 92, blind and needs a wheelchair for any movement of more than a few metres. My wife and I spent over 36 hours in the hospital as we made a point of being there during meal times. We could afford to pay the parking fees but there are lots of people who can't. I think it's unfair and I believe that hospital parking charges should be abolished. This would assist people who cannot afford to visit their loved ones because of the charges and possibly help the nursing staff as we did."" Sheila Davies in Plymouth: Hospital parking is a nightmare. My husband had a very rare form of lymphoma, he was very ill for nine months and getting him to hospital was difficult. I had to take him to the entrance, park on double yellow lines, drop him off and leave him waiting there while I went and found a parking space. There were pay on return parking areas but it was so stressful if you couldn't find a space there as you always had to have the right change for pay and display. Some days we were in hospital all day and it could cost Â£12.00. Eventually he was admitted until he died. It was the most stressful and unhappy time of my life. I understand the money shortage in the NHS and under normal circumstances I would not object to paying parking charges. But it was already a very difficult time for us, and this was an added stress I just didn't need. Andy Bowater tweets: Dr Richard Rathbone in Hay on Wye: My wife has an incurable cancer. For years we have attended regular monthly sessions with her consultant at Hereford Hospital. In addition she has to attend a clinic for infusions, blood tests, x-rays and emergencies. The car park charges Â£3.50 per hour, the most expensive parking in any UK hospital. Our journey to and from is about 90 miles and on top of this we have to shell out whatever parking charges have accrued. It's double punishment. Endure an incurable chronic disease AND pay outrageous amounts of money. Teresa Breed in Marlow, Buckinghamshire: I am a pensioner and cancer patient myself and have to go to hospital for regular check ups. I am always very aware of the time I leave my car in the car park, and if I have a long wait I get very stressed about how much this is going to cost me. I have also taken very sick people on visits to the hospital. Waiting around with them for hours has cost me a lot in parking charges. I find it disgusting that people are making money out of the sick and those caring for them. I think that all hospital parking should be free. A student nurse wrote and sent us a picture of her parking changes: Our university used to pay for us to park in the car park but they have stopped because it is too expensive. They advise us to get the bus, which would take me over an hour and a half using three buses or park 15 minutes away and walk. Alan John in Scarborough: My 85-year-old mum just spent five weeks in hospital. I never spent a penny on parking out of principal. I parked up on street and walked to hospital. This is just another tax and shows what a society we have become. Zoe Pitts' son attends the local children's ward in Kettering: The daily parking charge is Â£7.40 but can be charged more than once in a day if you have to leave the site. In my case I need to go home occasionally to see my other children and have a wash. If I go home once a day then weekly parking costs in excess of Â£100. The situation causes a great deal of stress for families at a time when they have more important things to worry about. I shouldn't have to choose between going home to see my other children and eating for example! Lorraine Phillips tweets she is not happy that staff pay for parking too: Compiled by Sherie Ryder",A bill to exempt carers from paying hospital car parking charges is being debated in the House of Commons.

The crossings came after a Â£28m deal between the UK and France to double police patrols on French beaches. Meanwhile, Kent County Council has announced it has begun accepting unaccompanied migrant children for the first time in four months. In August, amid a rise in the number of children arriving alone, the authority had said it could no longer care for them safely. Earlier this month the Commons Home Affairs Committee heard the number of crossings had increased ""alarmingly"". The minister for immigration compliance, Chris Philp, told MPs turning migrant boats back to France could be a ""critical component"" in tackling the surge in crossings to the UK. More than 8,294 people have successfully crossed the English Channel in about 631 boats so far this year. In 2019 there were 1,844 crossings and 299 in 2018.

The first stage will take riders through the Yorkshire Dales to Harrogate. Day two of the Tour will start in York and end in Sheffield. The race then moves south for the third stage from Cambridge to London, where it finishes. 'Dream scenario' Speaking near Masham, North Yorkshire, about 25 miles north of the end of stage one, Mr Prudhomme said he could not wait to see British cyclists cheered along by large crowds in Yorkshire. He said it would be incredible to watch sprint specialist Mark Cavendish heading into Harrogate - the end of stage one and home to the former world champion's mother. ""I can imagine for Mark Cavendish this first stage of 2014 is the most important sprint of his life,"" Mr Prudhomme said. ""A win in Yorkshire, at his mother's place, for a yellow jersey.

"By Bethan LewisBBC Wales education correspondent Its first major review suggested life skills such as dealing with grief and arranging a mortgage should be part of children's education. It called for the new curriculum to be amended on the basis of its findings. The Welsh Government agreed life skills were important and the new curriculum would develop ""capable learners"". Education Minister Kirsty Williams will address the recommendations when the Youth Parliament meets on Friday. The report identified ""large gaps"" in the life skills being taught in schools as well as too much emphasis on exams. ""We currently leave school with a handful of skills but no knowledge on how to speak in public, clean, maintain healthy relationships, buy cars, apply for mortgages, road safety, and many other skills that are needed to succeed in life"", it said. What do young people think? More than 2,500 young people were questioned as part of the Welsh Youth Parliament's research. It suggested that more than eight out of 10 young people had been taught about internet safety and dealing with bullying, only around one in 10 had learned about dealing with grief or political education. When asked which life skills should be taught, almost three-quarters of the young people questioned chose life-saving and dealing with stress. Kyra, 15, from Ysgol Nantgwyn in Tonypandy, agreed children should be taught more life skills generally to prepare them for leaving school. ""A lot of people probably come out of school after having so much support and then we just don't, it's all gone, and a lot of people are going to be lost from that,"" she said. Tomas, 14, said financial literacy was one of the most important skills. ""Learning to spend your money responsibly is a good skill, because when most young people leave school, they... don't even know the difference between a credit and debit card, get a lot of debt and you spend your life paying back debt,"" he said. ""It's going to affect you for the rest of your life."" The Welsh Youth Parliament report said it was clear pupils were not being taught the subjects they valued, and said politicians and schools should ""listen more to young people when making decisions on their education"". How should life skills be taught in school? The report found that life skills were often ""crammed"" into personal and social education days, which are viewed as ""days off"" by pupils. Survey results also suggested teachers did not feel comfortable in delivering the lessons and some were worried about ""not being in touch, and getting things wrong"". The report said the Welsh Baccalaureate was not ""successfully achieving its aim"", and therefore a new life skills qualification or certificate should be introduced for 16-year-olds. Other recommendations included a dedicated life skills lesson in schools every fortnight, a life skills coordinator in every school and a national life skills commissioner to oversee how it is taught across Wales.

"They said there had been a ""small but concerning"" number of drug users admitted to hospital over the weekend. Officers believe heroin may have been laced with synthetic opioids, including fentanyl. Tiny quantities of the drug are potentially fatal, even to touch, police said. Fentanyl is sometimes prescribed legally as a painkiller for the terminally ill in the form of a skin patch or nasal spray. It is about 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine. 'Possibility of overdose' A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""The potency means investigating officers need to wear protective clothing to handle the substance. A number of deaths in recent months have been seen across the UK linked to fentanyl."" Chris Faldon, nurse consultant in health protection for NHS Borders, said: ""Those in contact with heroin users should be alert to the increased possibility of overdose arising from heroin cut with these synthetic opioids. ""They should watch carefully for the signs of an overdose. ""Symptoms include trouble breathing or shallow breathing; tiredness; extreme sleepiness or sedation; inability to think, walk, or talk normally; and feeling faint, dizzy, or confused. ""Be prepared to call 999 immediately for an ambulance if someone overdoses and administer naloxone (the drug used to reverse the effects of heroin overdoses) if available and competent to do so.""",Police in the Borders have warned of a risk of overdose linked to heroin which may have been mixed with a painkiller which is 50 times more potent.
"70 acres of land at Carse of Gowrie on the Errol estate, east of Perth, will be devoted to housing the solar panels. The 14MW scheme is expected to be operational by March, and will generate electricity all year round. Bristol-based firm Elgin Energy has designed the site. It is being built by Canadian Solar which will initially operate the facility. Canadian Solar will cover the site with enough panels to power more than 3,500 homes, via the National Grid. Errol Estate was one of the first locations in Scotland to be identified as a potential solar farm site. Property services firm Savills Smiths Gore said the project was proof that large scale solar systems work well on the east coast of Scotland. Developers are continuing to source solar sites across Scotland with a view to developing schemes that are financially viable without subsidy support. Thomas McMillan, Savills Smith Gore's energy director, said: ""Solar technology has a far greater role to play in Scotland's energy mix than many people might realise - due to reducing installation costs and a climate of support from the Scottish government, we are continuing to see an appetite from developers to take forward new development sites, even with reducing subsidy support from the Westminster government."" The Scottish government announced it would retain a ""grandfathering guarantee"", where a project is guaranteed the same level of support for its lifetime, for key policies supporting investment in solar farms, despite Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) proposals to end the protection in England and Wales. Mr McMillan said: ""This announcement came at a crucial time for Errol, and it was instrumental in bringing this project to fruition.""","Construction has begun on Scotland's largest solar farm - which will have 55,000 solar panels."

In January last year, a day after their first conversation, he phoned up ""Chantelle"" via WhatsApp, requesting she sexually touch herself, the court heard. Giving evidence, Mr Dowd said that when he starting talking to ""Chantelle"", he believed it was an adult woman looking to enjoy ""younger girl-older man role-play"". Asked why he had started using the site, the father-of-two, said: ""I wanted to go on there to find adult women who were interested in sharing some erotic conversation with me."" 'Great actors' When the user declined to send him pictures, Mr Dowd said, this served as ""confirmation"" he was talking with an adult.

"Welsh Affairs Committee chairman David Davies said the first minister was asked to give evidence to the committee ""to spell out exactly"" the offer. The Welsh Government support is said to be worth more than Â£100m. But Mr Jones said he will not appear until the UK government confirms its backing for the project. In January 2017, a UK government-commissioned review of tidal lagoons recommended the project should go ahead. But UK ministers have yet to give their approval, citing concern about the cost to taxpayers of the subsidy required for the energy produced. During Welsh Questions in the Commons on Wednesday, Monmouth Conservative MP Mr Davies said: ""If there's a serious offer from Welsh Labour to support tidal lagoons the Welsh first minister should reconsider, come before the committee and tells us exactly what it is that he is offering."" Mr Jones has said that Welsh Government support - said to be worth more than Â£100m - depended on the UK government's commitment to the project. In a letter to Mr Davies, he wrote: ""Given our support is conditional on support from the UK government I think it would be more timely to wait until the UK government has confirmed its support for the tidal lagoon. ""At the moment I have little to add to what I have already said but once the UK government support has been confirmed I would be happy to attend the committee."" Replying to Mr Davies's question, Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns confirmed that officials from the Wales Office, Welsh Government and the UK government's department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy met in Cardiff last Friday to discuss the offer. He suggested Mr Jones should agree to the invitation to appear before the committee.

Shadow Welsh Secretary Christina Rees told the Commons that thousands of skilled jobs in Wales and England were earmarked to supply the lagoon but were at risk ""because the UK government can't make a decision"". Mr Cairns told her: ""This is something I really would like to happen. We'd like to see progress on this but clearly it must be value-for-money. ""You need to look at the jobs that will be created in the long-term and not those thousands of jobs you talked about because the project itself would deliver 40 or more jobs.""",Carwyn Jones has been criticised for not giving evidence to MPs about Welsh ministers' offer to help with the costs of a proposed Swansea Bay tidal lagoon.

"By Danny ShawHome affairs correspondent Eurofins Scientific was infected with a ransomware computer virus a month ago, which led British police to suspend work with the global testing company. At the time, the firm described the attack as ""highly sophisticated"". BBC News has not been told how much money was involved in the ransom payment or when it was paid. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was a ""matter for the victim"" as to whether a ransom had been paid. The agency, which is investigating the attack, said: ""As there is an ongoing criminal investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment."" Eurofins previously said the attack was ""well-resourced"" but three weeks later said its operations were ""returning to normal"". It said it would also not comment on whether a ransom had been paid or not. It added it was ""collaborating with law enforcement"" in the UK and elsewhere. The ransomware attack hit the company, which accounts for over half of forensic science provision in the UK, on the first weekend in June. Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files. Messages sent by the perpetrators demand a payment in order to unlock the frozen accounts. Eurofins deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year. It carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK. Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012. 'Court hearings postponed' An emergency police response to the cyber-attack was led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) to manage the flow of forensic submissions so DNA and blood samples which needed urgent testing were sent to other suppliers. It has led to delays in forensic science provision and is understood to have caused some court hearings to be postponed because information on the results of analysis conducted by Eurofins was not accessible. The ransom is likely to have been paid between 10 June, when Eurofins issued a lengthy statement about the attack, and June 24 when it published an optimistic update, saying it had ""identified the variant of the malware used"" in the attack and had strengthened cyber-security. It said: ""We are continuing to work intensively with leading cybersecurity experts to further secure our current systems and infrastructure and to add enhanced security features and measures to protect our systems and data."" ""The investigations conducted so far by our internal and external IT forensics experts have not found evidence of any unauthorised theft or transfer of confidential client data."" 'Reassurances' The NPCC refused to comment on the ransom payment but police sources said ""excellent progress"" had been made in dealing with the fall-out of the cyber attack. Police and law enforcement agencies in the UK are still not submitting new samples to Eurofins for analysis but the company says it is working towards giving them the assurances they need for fresh work to restart. The Crown Prosecution Service said: ""We are working to make sure all hearings remain fair and based on reliable evidence. While investigations are ongoing, prosecutors will assess the impact on a case by case basis. ""Cases where forensic evidence does not play a major role will continue as âusual if all parties agree. ""If âtest results provided by Eurofins are central, we will seek to adjourn cases for the shortest possible period."" Eurofins is the third major forensic science problem to hit law enforcement following the collapse of Key Forensic Services and a criminal investigation into alleged irregularities at Randox Testing.","The UK's biggest provider of forensic services has paid a ransom to criminals after its IT systems were disrupted in a cyber-attack, BBC News has learned."
"Snowdonia National Park Authority has two wardens on the mountain with another on a seasonal contract. Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team (MRT), which dealt with 202 callouts in 2016 compared to 193 in 2015, said more were needed to give advice to walkers. The Welsh Government said Â£400,000 extra had been given to the authority since 2013. Secretary of Llanberis MRT, George Jones, said having more wardens available would mean visitors could be spoken to and given safety tips, hopefully preventing some callouts. ""We react and there is only so much that we can do,"" he said. ""A successful year for us would be a decrease in the number of incidents, not an increase."" Snowdonia, like the other two national parks in Wales, has seen its funding cut in recent years. But the park's chief executive Emyr Williams told Newyddion 9 the priority within the current budget was to ""maintain the compliment of wardens"" on Snowdon. The number of people visiting the mountain has reached 600,000 per year and Llanberis MRT works with a team of 53 volunteers. Its vice-chairman, John Grisdale, said: ""If you turn back several decades we were turning out to 40 or 50 incidents a year. ""It has been quite a phenomenal growth over the last few years. Snowdon is like a honey pot - one of the busiest mountains in Britain."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Mountain rescue teams do great work and as the adventure sector continues to grow there is no doubt rescue teams will need the help of educators in minimising the risk of people needing their assistance.

"By Jordan DaviesBBC News The rare weather phenomenon of temperature inversion could trap the plant's emissions over Cwmfelinfach, an Aneurin Bevan health board boss said. Residents raised the issue before Caerphilly council approved the plans in December. The firm involved said emissions would have a ""negligible"" impact. Dr Gillian Richardson, executive director of public health at Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, has written to officials at Natural Resources Wales (NRW) recommending they ""exercise caution"" when considering granting the plant a permit. The environmental body is consulting on whether to approve the development. 'No safe threshold' Temperature inversion is where cold air is trapped in a valley by warm air above, preventing clouds and smog from escaping. Residents opposing the development have argued it could also trap emissions. The health board said temperature inversion was not taken into account in the original air quality assessment. It recognised that any emissions would be within legal limits. But Dr Richardson said new data showed the development would cause ""significant short-term local air quality deterioration within an area of deprivation, including vulnerable populations"". She claimed ""there is no known safe threshold of exposure"" to an emission like nitrogen dioxide, which can irritate lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections, such as influenza. The proposed plant would turn 100,000 tonnes a year of household, industrial and commercial waste, which would normally go to landfill, into fuel. The company behind it, Hazrem Environmental Limited, said nitrogen dioxide could be produced by any kind of factory. A spokesman said: ""The initial air quality assessment which was provided to NRW was based on a worst case scenario, as the exact specification of the dryer had not been received at the time of the permit application back last year. ""The dryer specification has now been decided on and the supplier has said that the NOx (mono-nitrogen oxides) emissions will be closer to 50mg/m3 rather than the predicted 300mg/m3 used in the air quality assessment. ""This updated information will be passed to both NRW and Public Health Wales for their consideration."" A Caerphilly council spokesman said: ""In considering a planning application such as this, a broad range of assessments and surveys, including those on air quality and transport are given careful consideration before a decision is determined."" NRW operations manager Jon Goldsworthy added: ""When we consider any application we look at the potential impact it could have and consult with health specialists. ""As part of the permit determination we will consider all the information available to us before we make a final decision.""",A health official has raised concerns that emissions from a planned waste processing plant in Caerphilly county may affect residents' health.
"The US billionaire bought the hotel and golf course for an undisclosed sum in 2014 and subsequently added his name. The golf course and most rooms in the hotel have now reopened following a Â£200m refurbishment. The presumptive Republican nominee will attend the official reopening on 24 June - one day after the EU referendum. Mr Trump said: ""Very exciting that one of the great resorts of the world, Turnberry, will be opening today after a massive Â£200m investment. ""I own it and I am very proud of it. ""I look forward to attending the official opening of this great development on 24 June."" Mr Trump is likely to be the Republican candidate in the US presidential election in November after seeing off a host of rivals in the primaries. Ban on Muslims The outspoken billionaire has been a controversial figure during the campaign, most notably calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US following the San Bernardino shootings in California. This prompted a petition advocating a ban on Mr Trump coming to the UK, which attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures. The size of the petition triggered a three-hour debate at a Westminster committee room, which ended without a vote being taken. Home Secretary Theresa May can - and does - sometimes prevent people from entering the UK because of things they have said. However, the Home Office said she does not use these powers lightly; only ""if she considers their presence in the UK to be non-conducive to the public good"" or if they are people who ""seek to harm our society and who do not share our basic values"". Mr Trump's comments on Muslims were described as ""divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong"" by Prime Minister David Cameron, who later said he stood by those remarks but would work with whoever was elected president. Mr Trump later moved to defuse any tension between the two by saying that he had been asked to visit Downing Street and expected to ""do just fine"" with Mr Cameron. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Mr Trump's comments on Muslims ""offensive"". She said: ""Mr Trump's views are repugnant, and they clearly do not represent the mainstream views of people across America."" His arrival in Scotland later this month is likely to be contentious with the fallout from Mr Trump's comments in the primaries still fresh in many people's memories. Turnberry is on the rota of courses that can stage the Open Championship and Mr Trump previously said that was a factor is his decision to purchase the resort. The Ayrshire course is Mr Trump's second in Scotland, following on from his Aberdeenshire resort at Menie, which opened in July 2012.",US presidential hopeful Donald Trump is to attend the official opening of the revamped Open venue - Trump Turnberry in Ayrshire.
"""I'm happy we can come back to our home but obviously there is a degree of concern there,"" Jackie Dickenson said. The council has allowed the move while in talks with owners of West Bay Residential Park Homes in Somerset. The park said soil tests would help to establish the ""nature"" of the erosion. Mrs Dickenson and her husband Tom were moved into temporary accommodation in March when Somerset West and Taunton Council condemned their park home and another at the Watchet site as unsafe. A spokesman for the owners, RS Hill and Sons Ltd, based in Fareham, Hampshire, said: ""After further discussion with residents, we listened to their concerns and felt we needed to learn more about the precise nature of the situation affecting the site. ""We suspended all enforcement action, and instructed a specialist company to carry out further soil tests."" The company said the tests had been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. 'Not the safest place' Since the Dickensons were moved, the continued erosion has seen their garden fall on to the beach below. Deputy leader of the council, Benet Allen said: ""We've granted them an extension so they can go back in while they're negotiating what's going to happen next. ""But looking at the picture you can see that the sea is rapidly eating away at that cliff and that anyone who lives in a caravan right on a cliff edge is not in the world's safest place."" Since March, five other park home owners have received a letter from the site owners telling them to move their homes off the land ""with immediate effect"" for their own safety. But some residents believe the erosion has been caused by poor drainage. Helen Davies, who owns a home at the park, said: ""The initial meeting with our landlord was very fraught, lots of tears and adamant that we will not be leaving our homes based on these incomplete surveys that our landlord has provided.""",A couple whose mobile home is in danger of falling off a cliff edge have been told they can return while its future is decided - even though their garden has fallen on to the beach.
"The wind warning, which will affect 11 counties in the west of the country, is in place from 14:00 GMT on Wednesday until 03:00 on Thursday. Meanwhile, the rain warning affects much of south-eastern Wales and lasts from 16:00 until 23:59 on Wednesday. The Met Office warned transport could be delayed in the weather. A fog warning has also been issued from 19:00 on Tuesday until 13:00 on Wednesday and affects eastern parts of Powys, Wrexham, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Monmouthshire. The forecaster said there could be some short-term losses of power in the wind, while flooding at a few homes and businesses is likely in rainy areas.

"It would see an online book of remembrance installed in a purpose-built structure in the London landmark. More than 7,300 names have already been entered into the book as part of the cathedral's Remember Me project. It is hoped the memorial would provide a reflective space for visitors to remember loved ones. St Paul's set up the online book to enable families, friends and carers to record and mourn those who have died as a result of the pandemic. It is open to people of all beliefs. The campaign for the memorial, which is being carried out in partnership with the Daily Mail newspaper, is hoping to unite people from across the UK who are grieving the deaths of family and friends. More than 127,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, government figures show. The online book would sit in a new portico structure which would take a year to build. It has been designed by Oliver Caroe, the cathedral's surveyor of the fabric, whose mother died of Covid-19. He said it would be a ""fitting memorial"" to those who have died and would be ""part of the fabric of St Paul's and part of history for centuries to come"". ""There will be many families like mine who never have had an opportunity to gather; to properly acknowledge thanks for the lives lived and to appreciate carers and clinicians we will never have met,"" he said. The memorial would be built on the site of an earlier porch which was destroyed by a bomb in 1941 during World War Two. Visitors would be able to call up entries in the online book, including a photograph of those who have died and an epitaph written by their loved ones. The Very Reverend David Ison, dean of the cathedral, said: ""The physical memorial at St Paul's will anchor the online book in a place where significant events and people have been commemorated for many centuries."" He said he hoped the memorial would be a ""way of inspiring reflection, prayer or lighting a candle"". London is already home to the National Covid Memorial Wall, which consists of thousands of painted hearts on a wall opposite the Palace of Westminster.",A campaign is being launched to raise Â£2.3m to build a memorial inside St Paul's Cathedral to those who have died as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.
"In an interview with the Independent, Owen Paterson said they could be condemning millions of people in the developing world to a premature death. Mr Paterson backed a letter from international scientists calling for the rapid development of ""golden rice"". But campaigners say the benefits claimed for the rice are misleading. 'Dark shadow' Mr Paterson told the newspaper: ""It's just disgusting that little children are allowed to go blind and die because of a hang-up by a small number of people about this technology. ""I feel really strongly about it. I think what they do is absolutely wicked. There is no other word for it."" Mr Paterson did not specify any particular groups in his interview but also said opponents of GM technology were ""casting a dark shadow over attempts to feed the world"". BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Paterson was known as a strong supporter of GM crops but his language seemed certain to raise hackles with those who took a different view. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokeswoman said it was Mr Paterson's strong personal view. 'Cause for outrage' People in the developed usually world get enough vitamin A from their diet by eating foods like cheese, yoghurts and eggs. But deficiency is a common problem in developing countries, and is estimated to affect between 140 million and 250 million children under the age of five. Vitamin A is needed for healthy skin and eyes and to help strengthen the immune system so that the body can fight infections. Deficiency can lead to blindness, illness and death. Supplements are available and the World Health Organisation advocates routine administration of vitamin A in countries where deficiency is a problem. High doses of vitamin A can be harmful, however, particularly in pregnancy Meanwhile, in a letter to US journal Science, a group of leading academics has accused Western non-governmental organisations of fuelling opposition to the development of GM technologies. They wrote: ""If ever there was a clear-cut cause for outrage, it is the concerted campaign by Greenpeace and other non-governmental organisations, as well as by individuals, against golden rice."" Environmental campaigners such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth have said there are more effective solutions to vitamin A deficiency. Mr Paterson also used the interview to defend the government's handling of the badger cull - aimed at preventing the spread of bovine TB - against criticism from animal welfare groups. He said: ""I cannot understand anyone wanting to tolerate this disgusting disease. ""I find it incomprehensible that these badger groups don't see that this is a horrendous disease for the badgers themselves.""","Opponents of the development of a type of genetically modified (GM) rice enriched with vitamin A are ""wicked"", the environment secretary has said."
"The overall number is down 11.7% - that is nearly double the drop in England which stands at 6.5% over 2012. The figures also showed a 3.9% drop in Scotland whereas in Northern Ireland there was a rise of 0.5%. The statistics were published by university admissions body Ucas. The general deadline for applying to start university in autumn is 15 January. However, students can still apply later. An Ucas spokesman said the December sampling point was a few days before the end of term for many schools and suggested that many applications would have come in after that. He pointed out that in previous years up to 40% of applications have come in during the final month before the deadline. Dr Philip Dixon, director of the education union Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL) Cymru, said he was ""surprised"" by how big the drop in Welsh applications was, but he said it could be due to a ""variety"" of reasons. He said some people could not afford to go to university in the current economic climate. ""But I also think youngsters are pretty savvy and they know the market and a lot of them are looking and thinking I could go to university for three years, come out with Â£40,000 of debt and won't be guaranteed a good, high paid job anyway,"" he said. ""They see their brothers and sisters and neighbours go to university and coming out and working in Tesco - not becoming lawyers or doctors. ""They can only get the sort of jobs they would get if they hadn't gone away. ""So I think some of them think they might as well try their hand in the job market now."" 'Early data' Stephanie Lloyds, president of the National Union of Students (NUS) Wales, said the figures looked worrying ""at face value"". ""But we need to be careful not to jump to conclusions,"" she said. ""A huge number of applications come in the final month, which is just days away from ending for most courses on 15 January. This downward trend could easily reverse. ""Our seemingly huge drop in Wales equates to about 1,500 fewer applicants, whilst England has nearly 16,000 fewer applicants."" The Welsh government spokesperson said that the ""early data"" would soon be out of date and that 40% of applications often come in the final month. ""The decision to go on to higher education is one that only individuals can make,"" a spokesperson said. ""Some young people may choose to find employment or pursue vocational training. ""Whatever their choice, we strongly believe prospective students from Wales should not be deterred from applying to attend any university in the UK due to a lack of funding or support. ""That's why we are providing what we believe is the most equitable student finance system we have ever had, offering financial support wherever students choose to study."" Universities in the UK can now charge up to Â£9,000 a year in tuition fees. The Welsh government helps pay any increase in fees for students in Wales, wherever they decide to study in the UK. It means students pay about Â£3,500 with the Welsh government paying the rest of the fee through a grant.",There has been a sharp drop in the number of students from Wales applying to universities in 2013.

"Arriva Rail North staff will walk out for three days from 8 July, while Merseyrail staff will strike on 8, 10 and 23 July, the final day of The Open. Workers at Southern also plan to walk out on 10 July. The RMT is in dispute with the rail companies over driver-only-operated trains which they say would be unsafe and lead to widespread job losses. The strike will also clash with the British Style Collective, the Clothes Show's big event in Liverpool from 7 - 9 July. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said any responsibility for disruption to services lay with the companies and their refusal to enter meaningful talks with the union. ""It is that flagrant disregard for the safety issues at the heart of the dispute which leaves us with no option but to press on with the campaign of strike action,"" he added. However, Richard Allen, deputy managing director for Arriva-run Northern, said he was ""deeply disappointed and hugely frustrated"" by the announcement of further action. ""Only this week we wrote to RMT again, urging them to engage in meaningful modernisation talks with us. ""We have been clear that for all our conductors we are prepared to guarantee jobs and current pay, and continue with annual pay reviews, if we can reach agreement with RMT,"" Mr Allen said. He added fresh industrial action would not solve the dispute. Merseyrail's managing director Jan Chaudhry-van der Velde criticised the timing of the strike which he said was designed to ""cause maximum disruption to people attending the last day of the Open Golf at Royal Birkdale"". Mr van der Velde claimed the company ""brought several new initiatives to the table in the last round of talks, the RMT is unprepared to work with us to find middle ground"". ""While we, as always, will do our best to minimise disruption, our passengers should not be made to suffer at the hands of the RMT, and the Liverpool City Region should not be caught in the cross-fire of a national dispute directed by unions in London."" The latest strike announcement comes as a long-awaited report into the troubled Southern rail franchise has blamed the unions for widespread disruption over the last year.","Train passengers across England are to be hit by further strike action, RMT officials have said."
"The Badger Trust argued the ""controlled shooting"" in Gloucestershire and Somerset should only take place with independent observers overseeing it. Defra lawyers said the monitoring was only intended to run in the first year. Ministers believe killing badgers will curb TB in cattle but opponents say shooting is not the best way to do it. 'Beyond moving goalposts' The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would not comment while the High Court case was in progress. ""However, we have always been clear that the Independent Expert Panel's (IEP) role was to oversee the six-week pilots in the first year of the culls,"" a spokesman said. ""Overseas experience shows a comprehensive strategy is the way to make England disease free... [which] includes cattle movement controls and vaccinating healthy badgers."" David Wolfe QC, for the Trust, said the IEP had concluded the controlled shooting ""was not effective or humane"". Mr Wolfe accused Liz Truss, current Defra Secretary, of breaching a ""legitimate expectation"" that independent experts would monitor the whole pilot cull until it was decided whether or not to roll it out more widely. He told Mr Justice Kenneth Parker, sitting in London, that the government had broken a promise, thus threatening to undermine public trust in future assurances given by government departments when controversial issues were raised. ""The secretary of state has gone beyond simply moving the goalposts [and] she is now seeking to sack the independent referee."" Scores of anti-cull supporters, many with faces decorated with badger stripes or wearing badger masks and costumes, demonstrated outside the Royal Courts of Justice during the one-day hearing on Thursday.",A High Court hearing to decide whether this year's badger cull should go ahead without independent monitoring will give its judgement at a later date.
"The festival runs until 6 October in Scotland's national book town. Ms Lumley said she was ""terribly touched and flattered"" that people would turn out to sit and listen to her ""roaming on"". She has also given her backing to a campaign to create a centre for children's literature in Dumfries. The talk by the star of Absolutely Fabulous was a sell-out event on Saturday. ""I do love it,"" she said. ""I love talking to people and I love sharing with them the excitement and ridiculousness of my own life. ""I love taking questions from the floor - people intrigued by some of the things I have been lucky enough to do. ""I am as old as Methuselah,"" she joked. ""So ask me it, I was there!"". Festival director Adrian Turpin said she Lumley proved a big attraction at the event - even if that had caused some unexpected problems. ""There was one point where we actually ended up stopping the traffic as Joanna Lumley came out and people were taking pictures with their mobile phones which doesn't usually happen at book festivals - or in Wigtown,"" he said. He added that there were a lot of good events to come. ""I think it is a strong programme this year - especially the midweek that we have particularly worked on building up,"" he said.

"Some experts have suggested it may be necessary to address falling rates of immunisation and a surge in diseases like measles. Matt Hancock told an event at the Tory conference he had taken legal advice this week on how to go about it. Unvaccinated children were ""putting other children at risk"", he said. The uptake of the MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine in particular has been declining in many countries. The reason is not clear. Rates dipped in the 1990s following publication of a report linking MMR to autism, but partly recovered after that research was discredited and disproved. However, the volume of anti-vaccine sentiment on social media has been swelling and in March, the head of NHS England warned ""vaccination deniers"" were gaining traction online. Speaking at the event organised by the Huffington Post, Mr Hancock said: ""I'm very worried about falling rates of vaccinations - especially measles. ""For measles, the falling vaccination rates are a serious problem and it is unbelievable that Britain has lost its measles-free status."" He added: ""The worst thing is if you don't vaccinate your child and you can, then the person you are putting at risk is not only just your own child, but it's also the child that cant be vaccinated for medical reasons. ""Maybe they have cancer and their immune system is too weak. ""I don't want the debate to put people off because there is absolute clarity on what the science says and what the right thing is to do."" The health secretary has said before he was willing to look at ""all options"" to boost England's vaccination levels, including compulsory immunisation - and while he did not want to ""reach the point"" of imposing jabs, he would ""rule nothing out"". Mr Hancock appeared to firm up his stance at the conference in Manchester on Sunday. ""When the state provide service to people then it's a two-way street,"" he said. ""You have to take your responsibilities too. ""I have received advice from inside government this week on how we would go about it and I am looking into it very seriously."" Measles is highly infectious and can cause serious health complications, including damaging the lungs and brain. There were more than 82,500 cases in Europe in 2018 - the highest number in a decade and three times the total reported in 2017. In England, the proportion of children receiving both doses of the MMR jab by their fifth birthday has fallen over the last four years to 87.2%. This is below the 95% said to provide ""herd immunity"", the level considered by experts to protect a population from a disease.","The health secretary has said he is ""looking very seriously"" at making vaccinations compulsory for all children going to school in England."
"Basil McCrea was speaking after a very public falling-out between himself and deputy leader, John McCallister. First, there was a clash over a last-minute decision to change the party's designation from ""unionist"" to ""other"" two days before polling day. Then, allegations of inappropriate sexual activity were made against Mr McCrea, which he strongly denies. Earlier, Mr McCallister had called for Mr McCrea to step aside as leader while an investigation was carried out into the allegations. Mr McCallister claimed the party re-designation issue was an attempt to derail the investigation which he had instigated. Speaking at the European election count on Monday at the King's Hall in Belfast, Mr McCrea said he was taking legal action but would not be drawn further. Mr McCrea and Mr McCallister lead NI21, which they launched together in June 2013. They left the Ulster Unionist Party to set up a new ""confident, generous and progressive pro-UK party to step forward and build support for a modern Northern Ireland in the 21st century."" On polling day last week, Mr McCallister called for Mr McCrea to step aside while allegations of sexual impropriety on the part of Mr McCrea against former party worker, Ashleigh Murray, 23, are investigated. Mr McCrea denies the allegations. Amid turmoil within the party and the very public falling-out between Mr McCrea and his deputy leader NI21's European candidate Tina McKenzie resigned from the party executive and said she was quitting active politics. In the local elections, NI21 took one seat. Speaking at the European election count on Monday, Mr McCrea said he had come to thank all the people that fought his party's campaign. ""I am not shy when it comes to talking about things but I cannot say anything because I am instigating legal action,"" he said. ""My lawyers have said to me; 'You cannot speak'. It's an instruction and those matters will de dealt with through the proper channels."" Earlier, Mr McCallister said he spoke to Mr McCrea on the telephone for 25 minutes on Saturday. He said he told him that no party leader could function ""with all this going on"". Disagreement arose between the men last week after the party re-designated as 'other' rather than 'unionist'. Mr McCallister alleged that decision was an attempt to derail an investigation into the claims of inappropriate sexual activity by Mr McCrea. Mr McCrea has denied any wrongdoing. Speaking to BBC News NI on Monday, Mr McCallister said: ""My focus over recent weeks was, and still is, on getting the independent investigation into these allegations and issues. ""Getting that and only that, is my prime focus and continues to be for the next week or however long that takes to complete."" 'Difficult days' He said he rang his party leader ""mainly to ask how he is"". ""Obviously, it has been a difficult few days for Basil and his family on a personal level,"" he said. ""I then... repeated that call that no party leader can function with all of this going on in the background, even to step aside without prejudice, to let at least the party function. ""We have to find, when this report comes out, mechanisms of, if there are recommendations, how we deal with that, how we take it forward. ""Of course, I'll be sharing the report with the Northern Ireland Assembly as well, to see what issues or lessons are there for them."" Asked if Mr McCrea said he would step aside, Mr McCallister said: ""He neither said he would or he wouldn't. We talked about it, but he didn't give a direct answer. ""He seemed remarkably chirpy on the phone, considering all,"" he said. Mr McCallister said he had no control over the timing of the controversy. He said the issue of re-designation was ""very much about stopping this investigation going forward"". He said the investigation could not be moved aside while the party dealt with issues such as recent resignations. Asked about his intentions for the future, Mr McCallister said he was going to complete his duty of care to the staff and members of the party.","The leader of Northern Ireland's newest party, NI21, has said he is taking unspecified legal action."
"Norfolk County Council said it plans to employ more social workers and school staff to tackle issues highlighted. Ofsted said tens of thousands of children were being denied a ""decent education"" and Norfolk's most vulnerable were not being safeguarded. Labour council leader George Nobbs said there was a need for ""decisive action"". He said Â£2.7m would be immediately spent on employing an outside agency to provide 40 social workers for six months, until the council can recruit its own staff. Funding of Â£2.3m has then been put aside to pay for council staff for two years. 'Legacy of underachievement' Mr Nobbs said a further Â£1.5m would go towards schools, including the appointment of improvement advisors and intervention officers, and Â£10m would support children with special educational needs. ""Ofsted has clearly signalled we need to take decisive action in Children's Services,"" said Mr Nobbs. The council said the investment would be funded by a Â£10m government grant, with the one-off spends coming from efficiency savings and the remaining Â£2.3m being made available in next year's budget. Ofsted inspectors criticised the county council's children's services department earlier this year, saying it failed to properly safeguard children and believed the most vulnerable were being put at risk. Inspectors also found the council had taken too long to challenge weak schools, leading to a ""legacy of underachievement"". In June, children's services head Lisa Christensen decided to retire following pressure to resign by Norfolk's MPs, with Sheila Lock becoming the department's interim boss.",A council criticised by the education watchdog and MPs for its failing schools has said it will invest an extra Â£16.5m in children's services.
"By Reevel AldersonBBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent Holyrood's Public Petitions Committee said that while good practice did exist the overall picture was ""piecemeal"". The committee's report said more research was needed into the ""hidden"" problem so the full scale of exploitation could be established. Charities who had called for the inquiry have welcomed the report. The committee pointed to a number of complexities surrounding the issue, including the fact that young people sometimes did not recognise themselves as victims, a normalisation of intimate sexual relations and online and mobile technology allowing peer sexual bullying and ""sexting"". It said education programmes showing young people how to recognise and challenge sexual exploitation and bullying should be made available across all communities in Scotland. The investigation began after the child protection charity Barnardo's handed in a petition calling for new research into the nature and scope of child sexual exploitation in Scotland and urging new government guidelines. First-hand accounts The committee's report included powerful first-hand accounts which have been made anonymous. One victim, known as Jessica, said when she was 14 she was involved with a group of older children who introduced her to drugs which she could not afford to buy. ""My new mates said that it was fine and introduced me to a new boy in the group,"" she said. ""After I had slept with him, I realised that I'd been used, but it was too late. I ended up hooked on drugs. ""The need and the want became more and more. Next thing was, he made me sleep with one of his friends to clear a drugs debt.â In a series of recommendations the MSPs said Scotland lacked a clear strategy to deal with the problem, although they recognised there was no hard evidence on the full extent of child sexual exploitation (CSE) and bullying. They called for further research to improve the way it was being tackled. Committee convener David Stewart said there was a very real danger that CSE would continue to be hidden if the full extent was not uncovered. ""The committee recognises that although there is a lot of positive work being done, it can be piecemeal. ""It lacks the clear leadership and co-ordination needed to tackle effectively the sexual exploitation of our children."" The Labour MSP told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""It did appear to us that there were gaps in the system. There's evidence of not enough co-ordination, certainly evidence of lack of training. ""We also need to look at using existing legislation in a much more comprehensive way. For example, we find that Risk of Sexual Harm Orders are not being used sufficiently. ""And we have good legislation like the Protection of Children and Sexual and Prevention of Sexual Offences Act 2005. ""Frankly, it's not being used."" Barnardo's Scotland welcomed the report. 'Lack of focus' Its director, Martin Crewe, said: ""The sexual exploitation of children is a sickening crime, and I think the committee has been shocked by the evidence Barnardo's Scotland and others have presented. ""We launched out petition on this subject in 2011 because of concerns from our frontline staff about a lack of focus on tackling the sexual exploitation of children in Scotland. ""The committee took on board these concerns, and have identified a series of important measures in the inquiry that followed our petition to tackle sexual exploitation of children."" Among the other recommendations in the report were: A spokesman for the Scottish government said it did not tolerate any form of child abuse, and the wellbeing and safety of children and young people was paramount. 'Significant issue' He added: ""That's why we have already taken several important steps including working with child protection experts to produce a report examining the problem of child sexual exploitation in Scotland and established an expert working group to build on the progress made in strengthening the support for vulnerable young people. ""While we will consider the recommendations of this report, it is welcome that both the committee and working group findings recognise progress has been made. We are also further updating the National Child Protection Guidance and other work to ensure robust procedures are in place for all children at risk."" Matt Forde, head of service for child welfare charity NSPCC Scotland, described the committee's report as a ""critical step forward"". He added: ""There is no doubt that child sexual exploitation is a significant issue for young people in Scotland, and one which requires a coordinated, national solution. ""While children from all walks of life - and from the most loving of families - can be affected, some will inevitably be more vulnerable than others. For this reason, the committee's recommendation on tackling other factors such as neglect, which put children at particular risk, is most welcome. ""There is still a great deal we don't know about the extent of child sexual exploitation and its long-term impact on victims, however we do know that interventions must be appropriate and timely. ""Importantly, we need to dispel the myth that CSE is simply the outworkings of 'unsavoury' generational norms. It is not - it is child abuse.""",MSPs have called on the Scottish government to develop a co-ordinated national approach to tackle the sexual exploitation of children.
"Bailey Sumner, from Blackpool, died from head injuries at Easter 2011. The SwampFlyer ride at Greenwood Forest Park near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, had been open only a week. The Dolgellau inquest heard that a mountaineering clip had been passed through a ""false loop"" in the rope supporting him. Park owner Stephen Bristow said the mistake should have been spotted during safety checks. ""The training required them to be absolutely rigorous about what they were doing,"" he told the inquest. Pathologist Dr Anthony Caslin said Bailey died after suffering a brain injury due to a fractured skull following a fall from height. 'Symbol of tragedy' The inquest jury heard Mr Bristow had taken a decision to open a zip wire at the park in November 2010 and after researching and taking advice had opened SwampFlyer on 17 April 2011. The ride was removed immediately after Bailey's death. Mr Bristow said: ""I didn't want it to remain there. It was a symbol of tragedy."" He said he had received professional guidance before opening the ride and had not been warned about the risk of a false loop. The park had used a voluntary Health and Safety Executive (HSE)approved scheme of safety inspections, and an expert had passed the ride as safe. ""We get the best advice we can find,"" Mr Bristow said, adding there was no legal requirement to have an inspection. The court heard there was ""top-quality equipment"" and staff were trained to check equipment. 'False loop' Det Sgt Gary Williams told the inquest that Bailey became detached from some lanyards which remained on the cable. The karabiner, a metal loop, was still attached to the loops of the harness. ""It was our opinion the karabiner had been attached to the false loop and as soon as weight had been applied it became detached,"" he said. Philip Mitchell, a chartered mechanical engineer from Leicestershire, who inspects roller coasters and other equipment, said such a tragedy had never occurred before. Kevin Elliott, the lawyer for Greenwood Forest Park, added there was a plethora of HSE guidance but none highlighted the potential peril in Bailey's case. Coroner Nicola Jones said the delay between Bailey's death and the inquest being held was down to a police investigation and the Crown Prosecution Service. She told the jury: ""What we want to know is how he came to die. This isn't a court that deals with any issues of blame. Nobody is on trial here."" The inquest continues.","An 11-year-old boy who died after falling from a Snowdonia zip wire ride had been wrongly attached to the equipment, an inquest has heard."
"By June KellyHome affairs correspondent, BBC News Naked selfies, dating apps and casual sex are covered in a wide-ranging Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) review. The CPS says prosecutors must understand that many teenagers believe sexting is part of ""everyday life"". It follows criticism over record-low rape convictions in England and Wales. There has also been a big drop in cases being taken to court. The CPS says it has worked with victim support groups to produce this new guidance aimed at challenging long-held rape myths and stereotypes. It found such stereotypes are common, such as believing that wearing a short skirt is proof of implied consent to sex. However prosecutors also need to understand that technology has changed the way people communicate and behave. Siobhan Blake, CPS rape lead, said: ""It's vital that our prosecutors understand the wider social context of these changes. For example, many teenagers believe that sending explicit photos or videos is part of everyday life. ""Our prosecutors must understand this and challenge any implication that sexual images or messages equate to consent in cases of rape or serious sexual violence."" Changes have also been made to guidance in cases involving same sex violence and when there are victim vulnerabilities, with a focus on psychological and mental health issues. The latest statistics for rape convictions in England and Wales are due out on Thursday. The last quarterly figures in July showed convictions at an all-time low. In 2019-20, 1,439 suspects in cases where a rape had been alleged were convicted of rape or another crime - in 2016-17 there were 2,991 convictions. The number of prosecutions also fell from 5,190 in 2016-17 to 2,102 in 2019-20. At the same time the CPS launched ""a five-year blueprint"" to reduce the gap between reported cases of sexual violence and those which come to court. Over the past five years, cases reported to police and initially recorded as rape have risen sharply to 59,747, but the number making it to court in that time has more than halved. Rebecca's story In 2017 Rebecca began a relationship with a man who lied to her that he was a police officer. In reality he was a convicted criminal with a history of violence. She discovered this after he threatened her with a knife, punched her, tried to break her hand and raped her. After the attack Rebecca says she had some seemingly normal WhatsApp exchanges with her attacker because she was terrified of him. She was told by CPS lawyers that because of this he would not be prosecuted. Rebecca says she was left suicidal by her experience and she's unsure whether she would advise other complainants to come forward. She describes the timing of this new guidance - with rape convictions at a record low in England and Wales - as a whitewash. ""I hope the myth-busting training starts with the CPS lawyers who specialise in rape and serious sexual offences. In my view they are the problem,"" she says. ""I have seen first hand how the CPS strategy is to pull apart a case and play the 'odds' game. ""Their approach is to second guess what a jury will decide. The lawyers are fixated on conviction rates and funding, not on representing victims."" Rebecca says that while a focus on digital communication might help younger complainants, it won't be relevant to older victims. ""Rape doesn't discriminate. It is endemic and it happens to people of all ages. There are swathes of people who do not get involved in sharing naked pictures or sexting."" The End Violence Against Women coalition and their lawyers at the Centre for Women's Justice are currently involved in legal action over rape prosecutions. In a case due to be heard early next year, they are mounting a court challenge that will examine rape prosecution policy and practice. Sarah Green, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""The new guidance for rape prosecutors is welcome if it enables those who prepare cases for court to predict and reject sexist stereotypes about rape and to really consider the impact of trauma on how rape survivors may present. ""Rape prosecutions are at an all-time low - with just one in 70 reported cases going to court. We hope therefore that this new guidance will be accompanied by comprehensive new training for all prosecutors and a clear message from CPS leaders that improvement here is expected and is a top priority."" Fay Maxted, chief executive of the Survivors Trust, said it was important to dispel misconceptions and misunderstandings. ""Negative stereotypes and myths about rape victims are pervasive in society, creating a toxic environment where victims and survivors fear they will be judged or disbelieved.""","Prosecutors in rape cases in England and Wales need to be aware of changing sexual behaviour in the digital age, when deciding if a case should go to court, new guidance says."

"Three men and a woman died in 2015 at Wood Treatment Ltd in Cheshire when the four-storey building collapsed. The Health and Safety Executive said after the blast staff removed cladding in 2016 without being told about the asbestos, although the firm was aware. The company was fined Â£2,000 at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court and must pay Â£3,000 costs. Wood Treatment Ltd, of Tunstall Road, Bosley, pleaded guilty in August to a breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act. Following the explosion in July 2015, the company was told by the HSE to fit new explosion-relief panels to an asbestos cement-clad warehouse. Although an external company had been hired, they did not work with materials that contained asbestos and staff at the wood processing plant removed them instead. After the panels were installed, the old asbestos sheets were cut to size and refitted to fill holes left in the wall, the HSE said. Although the company was fully aware of the asbestos and had an asbestos survey and action plan, the HSE said the information was not shared with employees and measures not put in place to contain the risks involved. HSE inspector Ian Betley said: ""Asbestos is responsible for thousands of deaths in the UK every year but it only becomes dangerous when it is broken up and fibres are released into the air. ""Asbestos should only be removed by specialist contractors, Wood Treatment Ltd put workers at risk by not following the correct safety procedures.""

"By Nick DermodyBBC Wales News Elizabeth Taylor was already a Hollywood star. And when she and Richard Burton met, their love both on and off camera became a global sensation. The passion and the turbulence between Burton and Taylor is laid bare in his diaries, to be published in the autumn. He wrote more than 400,000 words in pocketbooks, desk diaries and loose paper until just before his death at the age of 58 in 1984. Unsurprisingly, they include much about his volatile relationship with Taylor, which included marrying her twice. He is also frank about his drinking, his ambivalent feelings toward his own talent and the career that brought him such success. The Burton-Taylor story began in 1963 when they met on the set of Cleopatra, at the time the most expensive film ever made. Just like the parts the played in the film, Mark Anthony and Cleopatra, they became the most famous couple on the planet. They were the pinnacle of the 60s jet set - Burton even bought Taylor a private jet - yet their temperaments and talents were in constant conflict with the passion they aroused in each other. He was gifted son of a Welsh miner whose escape to Oxford helped him become a man of erudition, insight and self-knowledge, as well as a hell-raiser. In Taylor, he met his match, and someone who could bring him to heel. In November 1968, he wrote: ""I have been inordinately lucky all my life but the greatest luck of all has been Elizabeth. She has turned me into a model man but not a prig, she is a wildly exciting lover-mistress, she is shy and witty, she is nobody's fool. ""She is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography, she can be arrogant and wilful, she is clement and loving. She is Sunday's child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her and she loves me."" The following year, he wrote: ""I awoke this morning at about 7 o'clock. I stared at Elizabeth for a long time. I held her hand and kissed her very gently. Probably no woman sleeps with such childish beauty as my adorable difficult fractious intolerant wife."" Burton's generosity extended to more than just buying his wife expensive treats. It also included helping her towards the Oscar he was never able to win, according to one of his biographers, Melvyn Bragg. In his hour-long BBC programme on the man and his writings, Inner Voices - The Burton Diaries, Bragg notes that it is obvious to those who look carefully how Burton coaxed an Oscar-winning performance from his wife when they played opposite each other in the 1966 drama Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Burton and Taylor were married first from 1964 to 1974 and then again from 1975 to 1976. He married five times in all. His diaries were left to Sally Hay, who Burton married in 1983, the year before he died in Switzerland in 1984. She gave them to Swansea University in 2005. 'Secretly ashamed' They contain references to a claim that dogged him throughout his life - that he had somehow squandered his talent by working for the big bucks of Hollywood when others would have preferred him to continue on the stage, in London and not on Broadway. In August 1971, he wrote: ""My lack of interest in my own career, past present or future is almost total. All my life I think I have been secretly ashamed of being an actor and the older I get the more ashamed I get. ""And I think it resolves itself into a firm belief that the person who's doing the acting is somebody else."" Like his father, Burton died from a cerebral haemorrhage. He died at his home in August 1984. The Richard Burton Diaries, edited by Professor Chris Willliams, of Swansea University, will be published by Yale University Press in October.",He was the boy from the Welsh valleys whose rugged looks and voice of gold made him a star of stage and screen.

"It has been made by a local artist for the Essex Wildlife Trust from discarded plastic items picked off a beach at Walton-on-the-Naze. A number of seals along the east coast have had to be rescued after becoming trapped in waste strewn across beaches. The rubbish seal, named Poly (after polystyrene), was unveiled on Saturday at the trust's Naze Centre. Its creator Sue Lynas, who regularly works with recycled materials, said she was approached by the wildlife trust who said ""as I was a rubbish artist would I like to have a go at making something"". Poly was made entirely of rubbish collected by litter pickers from the local beach. ""But what you see here is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Mrs Lynas said. She said most of the beach waste was plastic - including a toy dinosaur, a Barbie doll leg, crisp packets, cotton buds - and some items which were more than 20 years old. ""I was pleased that we found very few plastic bottles, so the message about those may be getting through,"" she added. Sir David Attenborough's Blue Planet II series raised awareness of the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution and the environmentalist and broadcaster has called for the world to cut back on plastic to protect ocean life.

"Alzheimer's Society Cymru is calling for training to help GPs to recognise the symptoms and to improve diagnosis. Welsh Government records suggest that around 500 people under 65 were diagnosed with early onset dementia in 2017-18. However the charity suggests the real figure could be five times that number at about 2,500. Elin ap Hywel, 57, of Llanilar, near Aberystwyth, is a poet but has been unable to write poetry since her symptoms developed. She said she was ""terrified"" before her diagnosis last year and has now had to stop working and driving. ""There was something in my brain that had decided that it didn't want to do anything,"" she said. ""It was frightening. It's very hard to explain it, but it's horrible. ""I couldn't understand what my partner was saying. It was just terrifying. ""I remember we were on holiday in Hamburg when I first noticed it. We were hoping for a beautiful getaway but I was completely locked up and thinking 'what if I lose them?' I can't speak German."" About 40,000 people in Wales live with the condition that is often associated with older people. However Alzheimer's Society Cymru said there needs to be more awareness of early onset dementia. They warned that younger patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as having anxiety, depression or the menopause. Menna Boynes, from the charity, said: ""It's not just the public who think that dementia is an older people condition. ""If a young person goes to their GP with symptoms, dementia as a possibility doesn't occur to a GP at that stage. If [they] had training, that would improve diagnosis rates."" The Welsh Government said it has launched a learning and development group within its dementia action plan to ensure medical staff have greater knowledge and skills. Elin ap Hywel is part of the largest group of early onset patients in the world, gathered by the Cardiff University Dementia Research Group in an attempt to identify genes which increase or decrease the risk of the disease. Alun Meggy, from the research group, said, ""Developing a treatment is the holy grail - but there's a long way to go.""","As many as 2,000 younger people in Wales could have undiagnosed dementia, a charity has warned."
"Douglas FraserBusiness/economy editor, Scotland John Swinney has done what he had signalled, and kept the first year of a Scottish Rate of Income Tax at the same level chosen at Westminster. It was a safe centrepiece to a cautious, pre-election draft budget, signalling priority areas for the SNP re-election campaign - housing and childcare to the fore, with innovation and digital investment for the economy. The allocation put in place defensive measures to fend off opposition attacks on the Scottish government's performance, notably on policing and college funding. And it took the safe option of continuing to freeze council tax, for a ninth year, but by so doing, John Swinney increased the strength of case for reform of local taxation. So no big deal on tax? Well, not quite. The nature of Holyrood politics has started to change fundamentally. Whereas MSPs have 16 years of experience of distributing a block grant and balancing the books, they have ventured into riskier waters. Progressive They now have the powers to alter income tax, and are on course to get much more substantial powers still. And they have to set a rate. Even if there's no change, it's a choice. The democratic view of this is that it makes MSPs accountable for the money they raise. One economic view is that they now have to learn how the use of tax powers can have unintended consequences. Tax changes create incentives to change behaviour. Take, for instance, the new and devolved tax to replace Stamp Duty - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. For its introduction last April, John Swinney did something unusual - he shifted the tax burden from buyers of cheap houses to buyers of expensive ones. It was a clear choice for a more progressive tax, with 7% of transactions leaving the buyer worse off than under Stamp Duty. George Osborne followed the new design of transaction levy - though with a less progressive range of rates. This showed that ideas can be pinched, and that two very similar countries are likely to find they adopt similar approaches to taxation, however much the rhetoric is about divergence. That was underlined by the decision to increase the transactions tax on 'additional homes' - second homes, holiday homes and buy-to-let properties. George Osborne did it last month. John Swinney did it this month. But LBTT has introduced a new dimension to life at Holyrood. If budgets are to be balanced, the tax revenue from such taxes can't veer too far off course. Governments need an understanding of how much any tax or tax change could raise - and if that revenue isn't raised, they need the flexibility to borrow or find other ways of keeping a level playing field. 'Reasonable' The Scottish Fiscal Commission has been set up, with the official role to provide assessments of the soundness of tax and spend forecasting. While its report, published at the same time as the draft budget, said Mr Swinney's forecasts are ""reasonable"", it was less complimentary about the means used to get to them. It detailed how the Scottish government needs to gain expertise, and data, with which to forecast more accurately. That is after forecasts for LBTT revenue, in its first seven months, has come in Â£31m adrift from one set of Scottish government forecasts. There was a failure to judge correctly how much transactions for the most expensive property would be brought forward to avoid the new charge. The commission said it was ""increasingly concerned"" about the absence of an understanding of how behaviour change can alter tax revenue, and that a great deal of work had to be done on the effect of the supplementary charge on the property market. If MSPs are only now figuring out that transactions tax can change behaviour, they are going to have to get more robust, reliable data with which to model the impact of income tax. Unlike property, taxable income is a lot easier to move to places where it will be taxed less. And given that there is a high reliance on top earners to pay Scotland's income tax - more than 20% of income tax contributed by the top 1% of earners - it is rather important that there is an understanding of what happens if you hit high earners with higher taxes. Patchy The other key message from this budget is about public sector reform. We've heard lots about that, going back to pre-SNP days at St Andrew's House. The results have been patchy to disappointing. John Swinney put fresh impetus into that. Once again, he wants councils to work more closely together and more efficiently. There was a hint that, if they do, the pain of their finance cut could be eased. He wants more digital access to public services, and smarter procurement. And he moved the focus on protecting the health service financially, to challenging it to change the way it works. Such reform, he said, is at least as important as more money. And not reforming will undermine the ability of the NHS to meet rising demand from an ageing population, and rising expectations of what health technology can provide. That could put MSPs into new territory of confronting the power of the public sector professions and of other vested interests. It is another signal that governing is about a lot more than distributing cash and giving away free stuff.","Scottish taxpayers will have an 'S' at the start of their tax code, but otherwise won't see much difference in their tax bills and pay slips."

During those early days, as people scrambled to understand the pandemic, internet search engines went into overdrive. Our vocabulary changed and almost overnight we all became familiar with PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), lockdown, quarantine, contact tracing and the R number. It was a steep learning curve. On 27 February, journalists were huddled into a room at the Health and Social Care Board's Belfast HQ to hear confirmation of the first Covid-19 case in Northern Ireland. At that stage there was no social distancing. A hard tone to strike We became aware of the symptoms: fever, dry cough, headache and possibly shortness of breath. And we learned that those who were severely affected could die. For the media, striking the right tone was hard. While not wanting to sound alarmist or send panic through the country, the public had to understand that we were dealing with a global pandemic. Cases continued to spike across Europe and as we watched the death toll rise in Italy, on 19 March came the news everyone had been dreading. Shortly after 17:00 GMT I was contacted by a source saying Northern Ireland had its first Covid-related death. In a live studio interview, I told viewers that an elderly man had passed away with the virus. We reported that, while it was Northern Ireland's first statistic, he was also possibly a husband, father and grandfather. Stories of loss Some days stand out more than others. Addresses by the prime minister and taoiseach (Irish PM) underlined the gravity of the situation. Lockdown brought an eerie silence, hospitals began to fill up, pregnant women attended appointments alone and people continued to die with the virus. There have been countless stories of loss to tell - among them Brenda Doherty whose mum Ruthie was one of the first to die with Covid. Her family were unable to bury Ruthie in her favourite red dress or kiss her goodbye. I have interviewed Brenda several times over the past 10 months - each time it has been heartbreaking. I spent many days broadcasting from our box room lit by my little red lamp. For me, like everyone else, the small things have taken on greater importance - especially a weekly cup of tea in the garden with my parents. We've all also spent a year of having to give things up. I have watched my son miss school and his precious football. My daughter has been doing her university placement, not in Surrey, but from our box room and sitting under that same red lamp. There have been many important moments including filming in Altnagelvin Hospital at the height of the pandemic. We saw first-hand how hospital staff worked flat out caring for very sick people while keeping others alive. A lot of controversy has centred on how Covid has been tackled in care homes. Again, along with cameraman John Morrissey, I spent a day watching, listening and reporting on the lives of very vulnerable men and women in care. We end the year on a slightly more positive note. Just slightly. Promises of a vaccine became a reality on 2 December. That was a good news day. There are still mountains to climb, including another lockdown to get through and a new variant of the virus has emerged. Most of us will be glad to see the back of 2020, but look forward with hope to 2021.",2020 has been a year like no other.
"In his first Commons statement in his new job, Mr Davis said the forthcoming negotiations would be an ""exciting and considerable challenge"". The UK's departure will be formally triggered ""as expeditiously as possible"", he said. Opposition MPs accused him of ""waffle"" and lacking detailed proposals. Mr Davis was flanked by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox - who both campaigned for Brexit - as he addressed MPs on the progress made since the 23 June vote to leave the EU. He said the referendum had delivered an ""overwhelming mandate"" and that there would be no attempt to ""delay, frustrate or thwart"" the result. ""Naturally, people want to know what Brexit will mean - simply put, it means leaving the European Union,"" he said. 'Beyond doubt' Mr Davis said the government would be guided by ""clear principles"" - the search for a national consensus, putting the national interest first, acting in good faith towards other EU countries, aiming to ""minimise uncertainty"" and to put the ""sovereignty and supremacy of this parliament beyond doubt"". He faced questions - including from former Tory minister Nicky Morgan - about the importance of retaining access to the EU single market, saying he did not accept this would involve a ""necessary trade-off"" with accepting the free movement of people. He later said that if a requirement of single market membership was to give up control of UK borders ""that makes it very improbable"". Urged by ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith to confirm that taking control of the UK's borders was ""not negotiable for any other deal"", he said Prime Minister Theresa May had ""made it very plain that the current status of immigration cannot go on and we will bring it to an end as part of this process"". Mrs May has rejected one of the key pledges of the Vote Leave campaign - a points-based system for EU migration. Mr Davis said the PM had been concerned this system was ""too open-ended"" and in fact wanted a model that would be ""more robust, not less"". There was also a suggestion from former Conservative Cabinet minister Owen Paterson that the UK could accept all EU laws onto the statute book before abolishing the ones it did not want. 'Empty platitudes' Mr Davis said it was not quite so straightforward, because of the way EU law interacts with domestic statutes. The government says it will not trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which begins two years of formal negotiations, this year and has yet to set out in detail what it wants to achieve from the talks. Responding in the Commons, Mr Davis's opposite number, Labour's Emily Thornberry, said: ""The spin before today's statement was so much promise - we heard we were going to hear what the government's strategy for Brexit was. ""But what we've heard instead hasn't been a strategy, it hasn't been a thought out plan, it's just been more empty platitudes from a government that just continues to make it up as it goes along."" And the SNP's Tommy Shepherd urged the government to consider ""in good faith"" the case for Scotland to negotiate its own separate arrangement with the EU. Speaking later to journalists, Mr Davis said the EU negotiations could turn out to be ""one of the most complicated in history if not the most complicated"" but that securing a free trade agreement without undue strings attached was not out of the question. ""About forty countries have free trade agreements with Europe without any deals on migration, without any deals on money,"" he said. ""If we do a free trade agreement with Europe it will be beneficial for both sides, as it were, on its own two feet, without having to pay anything to do it. That's what we're aiming for.""","The government will seek a ""national consensus"" and ""take the time to get it right"" as it leaves the EU, new Brexit Secretary David Davis has told MPs."
"When he was elected in November last year George Ferguson said he hoped to provide 1,000 new homes each year by 2016. He said only about ""40 or 50"" houses would be built this year and gave a revised target of 600 homes by 2017. Labour's housing spokesman said the situation in Bristol was getting worse, not better. More than 14,000 people are on Bristol City Council's waiting list for affordable homes. Mr Ferguson said: ""It won't be achieved by the end of my first term. I was always very careful not to give specific figures. ""It looks as if we will only have built less than 60 affordable homes this year - maybe 40 or 50. 'Huge leap' ""I will see my way to multiplying that by a factor of 10 by 2017, but even that is a huge leap in the way we're currently doing things."" Assistant mayor Mark Bradshaw said ""There were all sorts of targets during the mayoral campaign. ""What we've seen since 2010 is a sharp fall in the number of new homes being completed in the city."" He said there was potential to build about 500 homes in the city on sites that already had planning permission. ""Because of cuts to the way we fund affordable homes we are dependent on the private sector and housing associations,"" he added. Independent George Ferguson become the first directly-elected mayor of Bristol in November 2012. Labour housing spokesman Ron Stone said Mr Ferguson had ""fallen woefully short on delivering much-needed homes for Bristolians"". ""The mayor wants to lay the blame at everyone else's door, but nearly a year in Bristol's housing problem is getting worse, not better,"" he said. Mr Stone said his party's solutions to the problem included re-using council-owned sites for small prefabricated developments, converting empty office blocks into homes and seeking ethical investment from pension funds for social and affordable housing. 'Trapped in hostels' Paul Noblet, from youth homelessness charity Centrepoint, said: ""The mayor is not alone in struggling to get new affordable homes built in the country's big cities. ""The reductions in social housing grants and the refusal to let councils borrow against their assets to build new council homes means local authorities are hugely dependent on developers and housing associations to cut housing waiting lists. ""Centrepoint and Cambridge University research found that across the country almost a million homes below market rents will need to be made available by 2021 to meet demand. ""If this massive shortfall is not addressed then more and more young people will be trapped in hostels, unable to live independently. ""Whilst building new homes is part of the solution, we also need to keep bringing empty homes back into use and making much better use of the private rented sector to house those in need.""",The mayor of Bristol has admitted his target for building affordable housing in the city will not be met.
"The remarks by Tatiana Gfoeller, Washington's ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, are revealed by the website Wikileaks. She said Prince Andrew, a UK special representative on trade, criticised the Serious Fraud Office probe of an arms deal between BAE and Saudi Arabia. Buckingham Palace has not responded to the reports about the prince. In the cable, written in October 2008 and published on the Guardian newspaper's website, Ms Gfoeller recounts details of a brunch in the Kyrgyz capital Bishkek with British and Canadian business people. Summing the event up, she writes: ""Astonishingly candid, the discussion at times verged on the rude (from the British side)."" Under the sub-heading ""Rude language a la British"", she wrote that ""[Prince Andrew] railed at British anti-corruption investigators, who had had the 'idiocy' of almost scuttling the Al-Yamama deal with Saudi Arabia"". She said the prince also criticised Guardian journalists - ""who poke their noses everywhere"" - for investigating the deal. Ms Gfoeller said Prince Andrew told her that the UK, Western Europe and the US were now ""back in the thick of playing the Great Game"" - a reference to the 19th Century struggle between the British and Russian Empires for control of Central Asia. ""More animated than ever, he stated cockily 'and this time we aim to win',"" she wrote. Those at the meeting were discussing potential investment in Kyrgyzstan, but the ambassador reported that Prince Andrew used the comments of one of the participants to criticise France. She wrote: ""Emboldened, one businessman said that doing business here is 'like doing business in the Yukon' in the 19th Century, i.e. only those willing to participate in local corrupt practices are able to make any money... ""At this point the Duke of York laughed uproariously, saying that: 'All of this sounds exactly like France.'"" Former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the prince's comments were ""unwise"" but he added: ""Anyone who is in public life in the modern world has to take into account that even remarks they make in a private context may end up on the public table. It was very unwise remarks to make."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""He's always been known to be a blunt speaker, that doesn't actually surprise anyone. Let's hope that he learns from this experience."" Labour MP John Mann told BBC2's Newsnight: ""If these comments by Prince Andrew are accurate - and of course we don't know that yet - then clearly it's of public interest that they are out there, so that he can judge whether he is performing the role well and government can make that judgement as well. ""Prince Andrew will need to think through if he is actually carrying out this role to the best of his abilities."" The Guardian has defended its publication of information from Wikileaks, but the Foreign Office has said that it puts national security at risk. Despite this, the Foreign Office insisted its relations with Washington would not be damaged and the US ambassador in London, Louis Susman, said he was confident the relationship would remain close.","A US ambassador wrote in a secret cable that the Duke of York spoke ""cockily"" during an official engagement, leading a discussion that ""verged on the rude""."
"HMS Echo was sent into the Black Sea earlier this month, after Russia seized three ships belonging to Ukraine's navy and their crews. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has visited the ship in the port of Odessa. He said the presence of the British ship shows support for Ukraine in the face of increased Russian aggression. It will be followed by other Royal Navy ships as part of a more constant British presence, he said. Nato has recently stepped up its operations in the Black Sea with increased warship patrols. There are increasing tensions between Russia and Ukraine over access to the area off the coast of Crimea. Russian forces seized control of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in March 2014, in a move condemned internationally. Mr Williamson paid a pre-Christmas visit to HMS Echo soon after it docked in Odessa on Friday. He said the ship was there to send a message to President Putin that Britain stands in solidarity with Ukraine. ""What we are saying to Russia, what we are saying to President Putin - they cannot continue to act with no regard or care for international laws or international norms,"" he said. The defence secretary made a point of meeting the families of the 24 Ukrainian sailors who are still being held and are now awaiting trial in Moscow. HMS Echo is not expected to sail through the Kerch Strait near Crimea - close to where the Russian Navy rammed, shot at and seized the three Ukrainian Navy vessels in November. Moscow has described the Royal Navy vessel - which is used to collect data about the ocean - as a spy ship.","A Royal Navy ship which has been sent to Ukraine will send a strong message to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the UK's defence secretary says."
"The early negotiations will take place by videoconference, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, with the first round of talks expected to last two weeks and further sessions approximately every six weeks. Ministers say they will drive a ""hard bargain"" as they seek to lower tariffs on exports and boost trade in services. But Labour warn food standards and workers' rights could be ""sacrificed"". Although US President Donald Trump has said he hopes to negotiate a quick deal, international trade agreements typically take many years to complete. The UK government has estimated that eliminating tariffs and reducing other trade barriers with the US could boost the economy by between 0.07% and 0.16% over the next 15 years, depending on the exact terms. But critics of Brexit say improved terms with the US cannot compensate for a more economically distant relationship with the EU, with whom the UK is negotiating a new trading relationship after its exit on 31 January. Ahead of the start of the US talks, International Trade Secretary Liz Truss said the goal was to open up new markets for UK businesses, bring in increased investment and create new jobs across the whole of the country. ""Increasing transatlantic trade can help our economies bounce back from the economic challenge posed by coronavirus,"" she said. ""As we sit down at the negotiating table, be assured that we will drive a hard bargain to secure a deal that benefits individuals and businesses in every region and nation of the UK."" Each side will have about 100 negotiators working on their teams. The UK delegation is being led by Oliver Griffiths, a senior official at the Department of International Trade. The first round of discussions, which have been delayed for several weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak, will cover trade in goods and services, digital trade, two-way investment and support for small and medium-sized businesses. Asked how long the overall process would take, Downing Street said both sides wanted to make progress as quickly as possible. In an 180-page document setting out the UK's objectives in March, ministers said they hoped to lower trade barriers faced by British car manufacturers, ceramics makers and producers of products such as cheddar cheese. The UK has vowed to maintain consumer and environmental standards and protect the National Health Service, insisting that drug pricing and tendering of health services will not be ""on the table"". But the US government wants more access to UK markets for its farmers, which opposition parties and consumer groups have warned would likely necessitate a relaxing of standards. 'Proper scrutiny' One major sticking point is the existing UK ban on imports of chicken washed in chlorine and other disinfectants, which the EU has urged the UK to uphold but which the US argues is not based on scientific evidence. Washington has also indicated that it wants to be able to veto the UK's ability to strike deals with ""non-market economies"", amid growing US tensions with China. Woody Johnson, the US Ambassador to the UK, said the trade talks were a ""huge opportunity"" for both countries. But shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said the UK should be ""wary"" of President Trump's intentions given he faces re-election in November. ""That is a recipe for a trade deal designed for the benefit of the major corporations behind American industry, farming and healthcare, which will have very real implications on workers' rights, environmental protections, the food we eat and our beloved NHS,"" she said. ""Labour will insist that any proposed trade deal is subject to proper scrutiny, and we will not let the interests of the British people be sacrificed to boost the profits of US corporations."" The US, which published its outline for trade talks in February 2019, accounted for nearly 19% of all UK exports in 2018 and 11% of imports. While the EU remains the UK's largest trading partner, total exports to the US in 2018 were worth more than twice the amount of any other single country.",Talks between the UK and the US on a post-Brexit trade agreement are to get under way on Tuesday.
"By Nicholas WattNewsnight political editor A message has been passed through informal channels from EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to top figures in David Davis's department. The UK would first have to agree the broad principles of the payment. The principles for EU citizens in the UK would then have to be agreed. Once these two principles have been agreed - on the financial settlement payment and EU citizens - Mr Barnier is prepared to open up the negotiations to cover all areas and the nature of the UK's future relations with the EU. This would meet the UK demand for the negotiations on the UK's future trade deal with the EU to be discussed in parallel with the Article 50 talks. Prime Minister Theresa May will trigger Article 50 - which have to be concluded within two years - in the final week of March. The exact sum of the divorce settlement would be agreed later in the negotiations. Amid reports that the UK could face a bill of between â¬34bn (Â£30bn) to â¬60bn (Â£52bn), Mr Barnier is saying the exact sum will be determined on the EU side by the EU's Court of Auditors towards the end of the two year negotiations. The ballpark in Brussels is that the EU has liabilities of around â¬600bn (Â£520bn). The UK would be responsible for around 12% of that, producing a rough figure of â¬60bn (Â£52bn). Former Finnish prime minister, Alex Stubb, who recently met Barnier, explained the thinking in Brussels to BBC Newsnight. Mr Stubb said: ""Basically what's going to happen is that Article 50 is triggered and a few key principles will be agreed - say the principles of finance or the principles for EU citizens and British citizens in Europe - the big things. And then at the same time in parallel you can start negotiations on a future relationship."" Mr Barnier is telling the UK that the main principle of the financial settlement is that the UK will have to honour the legal commitments it made as a full member of the EU. The key element will be the cohesion fund which is used to pay for infrastructure projects in deprived parts of the EU. This accounts for around a third of the EU budget which lasts until 31 December 2020. All cohesion funding has been agreed for the current seven year budget and the UK would be expected to honour the commitments it gave when the current seven year EU budget was agreed by David Cameron in 2013. The UK will not be responsible for its full share of the budget up until 2020 because the EU agrees on large parts of the seven year budget on an annual basis. Any commitments agreed once the UK has triggered Article 50 will not have to be funded by the UK. Mr Barnier will also table what are described as ""standing commitments"" in Brussels made by all member states. These cover two key areas: Nicholas Watt is political editor for BBC Newsnight","The UK has been told it will not have to agree the exact sum of its financial exit settlement in the early stages after Article 50 has been triggered, BBC Newsnight has learned."
"On Saturday, 3,000 people - mostly teenage boys - rode through the capital, pulling tricks and stopping the traffic. Jake, 19 - also known as Jake 100 - set up the Bikestormz project with his friend Mac after his best friend's older brother was stabbed to death. ""I quite literally want people to put their knives down and pick their bikes up,"" Jake told the BBC. ""Hence the slogan Knives Down, Bikes Up."" Jake is from east London, where ""some of his friends"" were stabbed. ""It really made me think about what I could do to change things in my community,"" he says. ""We wanted to bring young people together, take them off the streets and give them something uplifting to do."" He thinks riding together makes violence less likely. ""They've never been in a fight whilst riding their bikes,"" he says. But not everyone was as positive. One local resident said the cyclists ""had no concern for their own safety."" ""Hundreds of young people were cycling down Battersea Park Road,"" she said. ""Some were doing wheelies and standing on their bikes whilst moving."" One eyewitness said he was walking to a bus stop by Battersea Park when he saw the group come round the corner on their bikes. ""On three instances I saw cars swerve to avoid a full on crash,"" he said. ""It was total chaos."" You may also be interested in: Jake admits it ""is a bit dangerous"". ""But the buses don't move,"" he says. ""The local police support us and they cordon off the areas. Only the odd car driver beeps at us."" Clarence Watts, who lives in Southwark with his mum, was one of the bikers at the ride on Saturday. He describes it as ""life-changing"". ""It was amazing to see people riding together in support of such a great cause,"" he says. ""We rode together as a family."" His mother, Patrina Watts, was also there: ""I was there to show my support for my son and all riders,"" she says. She called Mac, one of the project's founders alongside Jake, a ""role model for the youth around London"". Jake says everyone is welcome to join them on their rides - and no prior experience is necessary. There are two London Bikestormz events a year, he says. And there are rides all over the UK which have been inspired by Bikestormz. ""People come and they don't know how to do any tricks but they have a great time,"" he says. ""As soon as you start slapping rules on kids they aren't interested. So this allows kids some freedom in a very positive way. ""I feel proud of everyone for coming on Saturday.""

"Ann Clwyd, who has been Labour MP for Cynon Valley for 33 years, said her argument in favour of action was about human rights rather than weapons of mass destruction. She added her frequent visits to Iraq made her fear for her safety. Ms Clwyd was speaking to BBC Radio Wales ahead of the publication of her autobiography, Rebel With a Cause. ""Some of my best friends in the House of Commons were on the left of the Labour Party and they were opposed to the war but yet they followed my argument that for me it was about human rights,"" she told Sunday Supplement. She said her three decades in Parliament had been dominated by human rights issues, especially those in support of Kurds in Iraq. ""I absolutely knew nothing at all about those [weapons of mass destruction],"" she said. ""I was there in February 2003 just before the start of the war and for the first time ever the Kurds said to me there's no other way - meaning that they needed outside help. ""We helped them re-build civic society, trained them to stand in elections. I went to the first election they had after Saddam and I know what we did and the Americans did as well to try and re-build the Iraqi society."" 'Frightening' She said she flew to Iraq about 25 times after the war. ""We didn't know quite when the flights were leaving Kuwait,"" added Ms Clwyd. ""We had to be ready to go and fly in the dark and then they had to manoeuvre the plane quite often because there were ground to surface missiles being used and we knew that some of the manoeuvres were to avoid what they thought was danger on the ground. ""There were a few occasions like that which you know were frightening, but I suppose I've always been keen on adventure."" Ms Clwyd, who criticises Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, also said she did not regret changing her mind about standing for re-election in 2015 after previously saying she would stand down. She added Mr Corbyn still deserved loyalty. ""I chaired the Parliamentary party and I know there were always an element that want to get rid of the party leader, and I can't tell you how many times that has happened while I actually was in the chair,"" she said. ""That person is elected as party leader and we have to back that person... Jeremy Corbyn is the leader, and he has to have our loyalty.""",A veteran MP has said she still has no regrets about her support for the second Iraq war.
"Thomas Channon, from Rhoose in Vale of Glamorgan, was celebrating finishing his A-levels when he fell about seven floors over a knee-high wall at the Eden Roc complex in July 2018. The inquest at Pontypridd was told steel bollards have since been built. He was the third holidaymaker to die there in a year, the inquest heard. Returning a narrative conclusion, coroner Graeme Hughes said ""simple steps"" of erecting a fence were not instigated after the death of Thomas Hughes from Wrexham in June 2018. ""These steps would have in all probability prevented Tom [Channon] meeting his death"", Mr Hughes added. He said Mr Channon was likely to have been ""intoxicated and fatigued"" but added: ""I do not find Tom was ridiculously drunk or out of control"". A post-mortem examination found Mr Channon was just under twice the legal drink drive limit. The group of eight had been drinking in the early hours of 12 July, having watched a World Cup football match. One described Mr Channon as ""drunk"" and dancing. Another said he had been ""disorientated"" in the bar. They last saw him at about 04:00 and became concerned at about 10:00 when they realised he was not at the hotel. The inquest heard the spot where Mr Channon fell was ""dangerous"" due to the low height of the wall and the large drop. Mr Hughes said he was not recording a conclusion of accidental death as there was an ""absence of evidence"" of how Mr Channon ended up at the base of the wall. Speaking after the inquest, Mr Channon's mother Ceri said she was glad there had been ""recognition"" from the coroner that the death could have been prevented. ""We felt from the word go that all they needed to do was put a sign up,"" she said. ""Somebody just needed to alert the boys that something had happened there [five weeks earlier] but nothing had been done.""","The death of an 18-year-old at a resort in Magaluf could have been prevented if simple safety steps were taken, a coroner has said."
"Nicola Sturgeon said three new mobile testing units would be deployed this week, with the first operational in Glasgow later on Tuesday. The number of tests that can be carried out at regional testing centres will also be increased. ""Technical issues"" with the test booking system are also being resolved, the first minister said. On Monday, some people were being directed to centres in England or Northern Ireland after requesting a coronavirus test. Ms Sturgeon said: ""We have always known that there will be fluctuations in demand for testing. That's why we have contingency plans in place and these contingency plans are already being activated."" The three new mobile testing units will increase capacity by between 1,200 and 1,500 tests per day. In addition to more testing being available at the UK government-run regional testing centres, Ms Sturgeon said additional capacity would be introduced at NHS Scotland facilities to manage local demand. This will include drive-through testing facilities in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. Eleven ""walk-through"" centres will also be introduced, adding capacity for another 3,000 tests per day. The first of these will be opened in St Andrews in Fife, the first minister said. ""We will continue to implement these plans to further increase capacity as we head into winter, as we have always been preparing to do,"" she said. ""But we will also continue to work to ensure appropriate contingencies are in place for periods when we have higher than expected demand for testing."" Currently, an average of about 14,000 Covid-19 tests are being carried out each day in Scotland. This includes tests by NHS Scotland and UK government labs, which operate the regional testing centres, care home portal and home tests. In total, more than 480,000 people in Scotland have been tested for coronavirus since the outbreak began. The first minister also acknowledged the issues some people had faced when trying to book a test, saying these had occurred across the UK following a ""major spike"" in demand for testing. It has led to some people in Glasgow and the central belt being directed to Penrith in Cumbria for test. Another woman, from Ayr, told BBC Scotland she had been told to travel to Belfast for her grandson's coronavirus test. People living in England have faced similar issues, with one person from Ilfracombe in Devon being directed to a test centre in Swansea - a 350-mile (563km) round-trip taking more than six hours. It is understood that some people in Newcastle have also been told to travel to Scotland for their test. Ms Sturgeon said this ""shouldn't be happening"" and work was being carried out to fix the problem. ""Where any technical issues do arise - as, unfortunately, with a system of this scale and complexity they sometimes do - we will endeavour to have those sorted as quickly as possible,"" she added.","Covid-19 testing capacity in Scotland is to be increased following a ""major spike"" in demand."
"About 1,700 university students at Manchester Metropolitan University have been told to self-isolate after 127 tested positive for Covid-19. Anna Billaney said: ""I'm studying textile and design, I can't do that from my bedroom."" ""I feel like this lockdown will have a big impact on the mental health of a lot of the students."" She added: ""I just feel completely neglected; there's been little in the way of pastoral care."" Students in accommodation blocks at Birley campus and Cambridge Halls have been told to stay in their rooms for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. The university says the lockdown is ""necessary"" to prevent the spread of Covid-19 to other students, staff and the local community. It has offered financial support, a package of care, food parcels and online learning to those affected, but many are worried about food. Aslan Warburton, who is one of 12 in a flat in Birley, said: ""We're all trying to get deliveries, but that's the same for 2,000 people, so a supermarket trying to deliver that much food to that many people is not going to be an easy thing."" Natasha Kutscheruk said: ""We're only allowed out for medical emergencies or to get food deliveries, but that's about it."" Her flatmate Joe Ward told BBC News: ""After these two weeks have finished, there's still going to be people who are positive with Covid and it's still going to be spreading around the accommodation. ""This could be going on for four weeks, six weeks, we just don't know, that's the issue. ""If I was made aware that this is how things would be and things would only be online, then I definitely would have reconsidered going to university this year. ""I would definitely like to think that there might be some sort of compensation."" Tom Gleave, who is living in Cambridge Hall, was already self-isolating after testing positive for Covid-19. He said the lockdown ""came down hard and fast and didn't really give people time to prep"". Lewis Fowles, 18, of Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, is also self-isolating after two people in his flat tested positive. Mr Fowles, who is studying acting, said: ""We've been told we can only go outside for a smoke which is pretty crazy. Supporting wellbeing 'paramount' ""It's a very strange atmosphere. My parents have brought me food for home but a lot of people are worried. ""This is hardly what I wanted for my first student experience - I mean I should have been going out and meeting people for Freshers Week. ""There have been lots of flat parties and there was one huge one with 100 people, which was pretty silly given the circumstances. ""But people aren't doing that any more as it's not allowed."" India Giles said: ""All of our flat has tested negative about two or three days ago, so we were all celebrating thinking we could go out. ""But they have a security guard on the door and you can't go out for shopping or anything like that."" Professor Malcolm Press, vice-chancellor of Manchester Metropolitan University, said ""supporting the well-being and educational needs of our students is absolutely paramount"".

"By Hazel ShearingBBC News New advice clarifies that people should use ""open spaces"" near to home, where possible. It follows confusion over whether people could drive somewhere to go walking, running, or cycling. Exercise is one of the few defined reasons that people in the UK are allowed to leave their home during the coronavirus pandemic. Derbyshire Police sparked a heated debate on Twitter this week when it shared drone footage of people walking in the Peak District, with a warning that daily exercise should not involve long trips or journeys in the car. Some Twitter users argued that those in the footage were not in the wrong as they were keeping apart from other people, while others classed driving to places as unnecessary. The prime minister, who has tested positive for coronavirus, said on Monday that people can take ""one form of exercise a day"" - either on their own or with people they live with. The government's official guidelines list running, walking and cycling as examples. But the initial guidelines did not advise if, or how far, people could travel in order to exercise. While the new advice does go further, it does not explicitly define what counts as ""local"", and whether or not people can use cars. Mike, 53, from Lancashire, had to put the mountain biking festival he usually runs on hold this summer because of the pandemic - but still takes his bike out for rides on the Yorkshire Moors. His house is a short cycle away, but a busy road means that he is unable to take his five-year-old with him. ""I don't want him riding up and down the main road outside our house, he's not quite ready for that yet,"" he told the BBC. ""But I know if I put his bike in the boot of my car and drive for half a mile, there are lots of countryside trails where he can ride safely along with me."" The RAC said before the release of the latest goverment advice that people shouldn't drive places to exercise, recommending instead that they use their gardens - where possible - or leave home ""on foot or by bike"". Superintendent Steve Pont, of Derbyshire Police, echoed this advice in an interview with the BBC's Today programme. ""Every time you're out in public, away from your home, there's a possibility you might catch or pass on the virus,"" he said. He added that unnecessary trips in the car or walks along cliff tops could lead to accidents, and put emergency service workers at risk. Mountain Rescue has also urged people to ""stay local"" and avoid travel ""unless it's essential"". Steve Lyons, 62, from Chippenham in Wiltshire, said that, initially, he could not work out what those people in the video posted by Derbyshire Police were doing wrong. ""In an ideal world you get in the car, you drive to somewhere nice, you go for a walk, and you drive home again,"" he said. ""But there will be instances where somebody gets hurt, somebody injures themselves walking, or a car breaks down... Are you putting people unnecessarily at risk who might have to come and recover you?"" He and his wife usually drive to a spot by a canal to go walking, but are now opting for walks in town instead. He said that even in London it is ""not impossible to get out your front door"" and walk somewhere apart from other people. However, Rose Drew, who is in her 50s and lives in York, said travelling by car enables her to get fresh air with her daughter, who has a disability. She thinks that maintaining a connection with nature is important for environmental and mental health reasons. ""Not everyone can get out to the countryside,"" she said, adding that people who live in cities ""don't want to walk around on concrete"" but might have cars to travel. ""How crowded can the Moors get? It's virtually impossible,"" she added. For Mike, too, exercise in open spaces is important for people's mental and physical health - and he said that staying healthy alleviates pressure on the NHS in its own way. But he thinks the guidance from the government on driving had ""not been as clear as it could be"". ""I think to simply say you cannot drive your car, get out of that car and take a walk seems to be going too far,"" he said.","The government has said people should ""stay local"" and not travel unnecessarily for exercise."
"Mr Braine was elected leader in August 2019, making him the party's eighth different leader since the Brexit referendum in 2016. He said he had wanted to unite the party but had been met with ""pre-emptive opposition"". UKIP has yet to comment but it's understood the party intends to appoint an interim leader shortly. The party has struggled to make an electoral impact in recent years, losing all its MEPs to The Brexit Party led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

"Under the plans it would be up to customers to opt in to receiving adult content when they sign up for a broadband contract. Currently most providers offer a range of filters and tools that have to be set up by parents to block pornography. Campaigners have said it is too easy for children to access explicit adult content on their phones and computers. Prime Minister David Cameron is due to meet internet service providers (ISPs) to discuss the measures. In a statement, Mr Cameron said: ""I want to fully explore every option that might help make children safer - including whether internet filters should be switched on as the default, so that adult content is blocked unless you decide otherwise."" Conservative backbencher Claire Perry has accused internet companies of being ""complicit"" in exposing children to pornography and ""dragging their feet"" on the issue. Shadow culture secretary Harriet Harman said ""keeping children safe online is a real problem and a concern for millions of parents"". She said: ""We need to work closely with the industry to develop blocking technology which is easy to use and effective so that parents have the control they need to protect their children."" 'Totally wrong' Nick Pickles, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, described the consultation as a ""positive step"". But he added that ministers should concentrate on making it easier for parents to take action rather than restricting access to websites. He said: ""Mass blocking of websites was rejected in the US for breaking internet security and in Holland because it doesn't work and drives criminals underground. ""The government should make clear they will not consider a policy that will make it harder to catch child abusers and put consumers at risk when shopping online. ""As recognised by Ofcom, it is trivial to get around an opt-in blocking system so it would be totally wrong for this to be used as an excuse to spy on all our internet activity."" The children's charity NSPCC said it was not in favour of any ""halfway house approach"" that would risk children ""viewing damaging pornography"". NSPCC chief executive Andrew Flanagan said: ""An opt-in system will help provide better protection by blocking unwanted material, which is where industry can play a leading role."" But he said no system was foolproof, and underlined the importance of the role parents played in protecting the children from pornography. Last year four leading web providers - BT, Sky, TalkTalk and Virgin - said they would offer customers the option to block adult content at the point of subscription.",The government will consult on new measures to protect children from internet pornography.
"By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter, BBC News He had spent much of the first 40 years of his life in the shadow of his older brother David, the former foreign secretary. He did the same course - Philosophy, Politics and Economics - at Oxford University, at the same college, and followed David into a similar backroom role in the Labour Party, albeit on different sides of the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown divide. The two even lived in neighbouring flats in the same building for a while. They both sat in Gordon Brown's cabinet, with Ed filling the less high profile role of climate change and energy secretary. Ed used to introduce himself at meetings as ""the other Miliband"". His stunning victory in the 2010 leadership contest caused a rift in the Miliband family that is still healing. Mr Miliband himself has admitted it has been more difficult than he expected. David was offered a shadow cabinet role but opted to leave British politics altogether, taking up a job as the head of the International Rescue charity in New York, avoiding speculation about rivalry with his younger brother that would surely have followed had he stayed around. So who is Edward Samuel Miliband? His supporters insisted during the leadership campaign that he was more ""human"", less aloof than David. He is a self-confessed maths ""geek"" who was a secret Dallas fan as a boy - they are hardly Bobby and JR, but Ed had enough of a ruthless streak to challenge his brother for the job long thought to be his. Marxist father was fierce Labour critic Mr Miliband has made much of the fact he went to an ordinary North London comprehensive school. And while this is true, his childhood will probably have been a little more colourful, and certainly more intellectually stimulating, than that of the average North London schoolboy. His father, Ralph, a Polish Jew who fled the Nazi invasion of Belgium in 1940, was one of the leading Marxist theorists of his generation - and a fierce critic of the Labour Party. Their mother, Marion Kozak, is also a well-known figure on the British left. Fast facts: Ed Miliband Growing up, their Primrose Hill home played host to the leading intellectuals and Labour politicians of the age, with dinner guests including Ken Livingstone and Tariq Ali. The family's basement dining room was the scene of high-minded and often heated debates between major figures on the Left. The Miliband brothers were always encouraged to chip into the debate with their own opinions and, apparently, Tony Benn was even known to have given the brothers a few pointers with their homework. ""[They were] very, very fresh lively, intelligentâ¦ and I must admit Ed amazed me by being able to do the Rubik's Cube... in one minute 20 seconds and, as I recall, just with one hand too,"" remembers socialist academic Robin Blackburn, a close friend of Ralph's. Ed has spoken of how he bonded with his father when he accompanied him on trips to the US, where Ralph worked as a lecturer. It is also where he became a fan of the Boston Red Sox baseball team. Leadership rivalry 'was huge strain for mother' But although he is sometimes said to be politically closer to Ralph than his brother, in truth the two Miliband brothers are worlds away from his brand of socialism. Although no lover of Soviet-style one-party rule or violent revolution, he had abandoned the Labour Party long before his sons were born, believing socialism could never be achieved through Parliamentary means. Ralph died in 1994, a few weeks before Tony Blair became Labour leader, but had viewed with unease his sons' part in creating what would become known as New Labour. Their mother Marion, an early CND activist and human rights campaigner, who is a leading member of the Jews for Justice for Palestinians group, and who, unlike Ralph, remained in the Labour Party, is thought to have been a greater influence on their political development. ""There's no doubt that Ed got a lot of his drive from Marion and a lot of his feel for nitty-gritty grassroots politics from Marion too,"" says Dr Marc Stears, politics fellow at the University of Oxford. Friends say the leadership contest between the brothers was a huge ""strain"" for Marion. She has even told people it would have been much easier had they simply become academics rather than politicians. David and Ed's background helped speed their way into Labour politics - Ed spent the summer after his O-levels doing work experience for Tony Benn, then a senior Labour left-winger. Mr Benn would reward him years later by backing his leadership campaign. By their teenage years, both brothers were fully fledged campaigners for Labour. Ed was never part of the ""cool"" set at school, although he has joked that he did not get beaten up too often. Number crunching skills attracted Brown's attention Ed has spoken about how the experience of seeing equally bright pupils, from less privileged backgrounds, failing to reach their potential had a profound impact on his politics and outlook. The more academically gifted of the two, Ed did better than David in his A-levels, following his brother to Corpus Christi College in Oxford, where he became involved in student activism. ""My best four weeks at university were when we had a rent dispute with the college,"" he told The Guardian in an interview. ""I wasn't particularly bookish; what really got me going was student activism, and mobilising people. It was quite a hard thing to recognise if you come from an academic family, but, if I'm honest, it's true. Politics always motivated me more than academia."" At the time, he was described as being less opinionated than his brother, who had a reputation as fiercely bright but rather socially inept. After briefly working as a television journalist, Ed was taken on by current deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman, then a shadow minister, as a speech writer and researcher. His number-crunching skills soon brought him to the attention of the then shadow chancellor. Gordon Brown ""burgled him off Harriet"", Charlie Whelan, Mr Brown's former spin doctor, has said. Diplomatic skills 'used to make peace with Blair's No 10' When Labour came to power, Ed was pitched into the never-ending turf wars between the Treasury and Downing Street, coming to be seen as one of Mr Brown's key backroom allies. He gained a reputation as something of a diplomat, whose skill at defusing rows was reportedly much in demand in the escalating battle between Brownites and Blairites. It is said that Ed would often be despatched from the Brown camp to make peace with Downing Street, where David worked as head of Blair's policy unit. ""I was the one who tried to bridge some of the nonsense that there was,"" is how he now describes his role. But he baulks at the usual description of himself as a ""Brownite"", claiming to be one of the least ""tribal"" of MPs. In 2003, he spent a year's sabbatical at Harvard University, to study and lecture at Harvard's Centre for European Studies, before becoming an MP for the safe seat of Doncaster North in 2005. He lives in a fashionable North London district close to where he grew up, with barrister wife Justine Thornton and their two young sons Daniel and Samuel. Ridiculed for his voice and appearance The couple, who had lived together for several years, got married in May 2011. Support from the trade unions proved decisive in Ed Miliband's Labour leadership victory, and he has sought to move the party on from the New Labour era, projecting a more left wing message on tax and inequality. He has also distanced himself from the Iraq War, calling the 2003 invasion a ""tragic error"" and saying he would have voted to give weapons inspectors more time had he been an MP at the time. His relationship with the New Labour establishment - most of whom backed David for the leadership - has been prickly at times, although Tony Blair buried the hatchet by giving a supportive speech during the general election campaign. But although the party has avoided the psychodramas and splits some had predicted after his election, Mr Miliband has had a far from easy ride as Labour leader. He was ridiculed from the beginning by the media for his voice and appearance, with cartoonists portraying him as Wallace, from the Wallace and Gromit animations. The mockery reached its zenith with a photograph of Mr Miliband struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. 'I am not from central casting' But there was also internal Labour criticism that he lacked the leadership skills to take the party back into power and that his focus on issues such as zero-hours contracts and taxing the rich was too narrow. He was not reaching out to the middle-income, southern England voters Tony Blair had gathered up to win three general elections. There were some unforced errors, such as forgetting to mention the deficit in his 2014 party conference speech and having to apologise for a grinning snap of him promoting the Sun newspaper. But he has endured the most sustained campaign of press criticism levelled at a Labour leader since the days of Neil Kinnock. Mr Miliband has made much of the way that he has stood up to vested interests - starting with Rupert Murdoch, over phone hacking, and then the energy companies, when he announced a planned price freeze. But his personal poll ratings have been among the lowest of any Labour leader, well below that of the party itself. He sought to do the only thing he could to counter the barrage of criticism about his style - attempt to make a virtue of it. ""I am not from central casting,"" he said in a speech last year. ""You can find people who are more square-jawed, more chiselled, look less like Wallace. ""You could probably even find people who look better eating a bacon sandwich. ""If you want the politician from central casting, it's just not me, it's the other guy. ""And if you want a politician who thinks that a good photo is the most important thing, then don't vote for me. ""Because I don't. Here's the thing: I believe that people would quite like somebody to stand up and say there is more to politics than the photo-op."" His Conservative opponents sought to make Mr Miliband's character an issue at the general election, constantly saying he was too weak and ""in the pocket"" of the SNP to be prime minister. But the Labour leader had a better campaign than many expected, and saw a boost in his personal ratings, from an admittedly low base. There were some mis-steps - his unveiling of a stone with six pledges carved in attracted mockery, even from sympathetic newspapers. But he showed a new level of self-confidence to go with the resilience he had always possessed, even managing to coin a catchphrase of sorts in a bruising Channel 4 interview with Jeremy Paxman. Asked if he was tough enough to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin, he replied, in a John Wayne style: ""Hell, yes, I'm tough enough."" He even became something of a sex symbol, with a Twitter-based #Milifandom campaign. But when the scale of Labour's election defeat became clear on the morning of 8 May, Mr Miliband resigned as party leader, saying he took ""absolute and total responsibility"" for the party's defeat.","He may have served in Gordon Brown's cabinet, but few people outside politics had heard of Ed Miliband before he was elected leader of the Labour Party in 2010, a post he has now relinquished in the wake of Labour's election defeat."
"The mine's owners, UK Coal, called the postal vote after members of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) rejected plans for a ""managed closure"". UK Coal is to shut the mine and Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire over the next 18 months. The firm said the pits faced ""instant closure"" if miners rejected the plan. The ballot paper asks the workers: ""Will you work to deliver the plan proposed for Kellingley Colliery to December 2015?"" Last week, UK Coal secured a Â£10m loan from the government to fund the closure of the two mines, which the company claims are uneconomic. 'Stark choice' After a meeting of about 250 members on Sunday, the union said it wanted the government to explore alternative options for keeping the pit as a ""going concern"" and called for further talks. Andrew Mackintosh, from UK Coal, said the company was ""forced"" into holding the ballot following the meeting. ""We have that stark choice of instant closure or the 18 months,"" he said. ""If we've got 18 months, everyone gets their redundancy, suppliers get paid, we close them down safely and it gives people the chance to look for a job."" Chris Kitchen, the general secretary of the NUM, said he thought his members would vote in favour of the plan. ""In order to fight to keep Kellingley open, we have to keep it open,"" he said.

"An investigation has been launched to find out what happened to the Â£3.2m underwater feature, in Boscombe, Bournemouth, after a recent inspection. The reef is also to undergo refinement works by creator ASR Ltd after a report found it needed a number of tweaks. Bournemouth council said it was ""erring on the side of caution"". The reef, which ran over budget and suffered a series of delays, was created to enhance waves using 55 giant sand-filled bags which are 225m (740ft) out at sea. It opened in November 2009 but has been criticised for not working properly. Local traders have argued it has added to the regeneration of the once-rundown town of Boscombe. Extreme sport The council said following a scheduled six-monthly inspection, it was advising people not to use the reef while it underwent further work and maintenance. It said a routine inspection carried out on 23 March showed that ""substantial changes"" had altered the profile of the reef structure which could alter current flows over it. Tony Williams, council executive director, said: ""We're aware that significant changes have altered the structure of the reef and we have commissioned further investigation to be carried out to provide more detail. ""Until we know further information we are erring on the side of caution and advising people not to use the reef. ""Given that surfing is an extreme sport and always includes an element of risk, health and safety surrounding the surf reef project has been paramount from the start."" New Zealand-based ASR Ltd confirmed it will return to carry out its own assessment. The council added it was ""optimistic"" the issues could be addressed and the planned refinement works implemented. Nick Behunin, managing director, said: ""We have only recently received the information from the preliminary inspection and we are currently evaluating it."" The council has withheld Â£150,000 from ASR after a specialist report found the reef had not achieved all of its objectives. It will pay Â£55,000 when work is finished and a further Â£95,000 if the improvements are successful. ASR has denied the reef failed and said it was only one of the criteria, the wave lengths, which it had not met the requirements.","Europe's first artificial surf reef off the Dorset coast has been closed due to safety concerns over ""substantial changes"" to the structure's shape."
"Mr Batten had been criticised by some in the party - including former leader Nigel Farage - for appointing far-right activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser. UKIP said its ruling body had voted ""overwhelmingly"" against a motion of no confidence. However it said it did not endorse Mr Robinson's appointment. He was barred from membership ""through his associations"", it added. Former EDL leader Mr Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - was jailed for 13 months in May for contempt of court, although his conviction was later quashed over procedural concerns. The case has since been referred to the attorney general. It was his third spell in prison since January 2013, having served sentences for mortgage fraud and a passport offence. However, after appointing Mr Robinson to advise on rape gangs and prison reform, Mr Batten said: ""He's a good person to have on side, a lot of people respect his stand on things and his courage."" Mr Robinson is expected to feature in a Brexit march in London on 9 December. UKIP said it had not organised the event, although members were ""free to attend"". UKIP's former deputy leader Suzanne Evans has quit the party over what she described as the ""perverse direction"" in which Mr Batten was taking it. She said she had hoped ""sense would prevail"" at the NEC meeting, but had been disappointed by the outcome. ""I feel I have no option but to join the thousands of other good, decent former UKIP members in walking out of the door in disgust at the radical change in UKIP's direction,"" she said in a Facebook post.

"Work by contractors to remove a grade II-listed seafront shelter has also started. The 1920s landmark was badly damaged and is being dismantled for repair. Ceredigion council aims to completely re-open the promenade to the public by Easter after it was battered by high tides and storms. Volunteers had been asked to join the promenade clean-up at 10:00 GMT and more than 200 turned out, with buckets and shovels. As well as students, one man had travelled from Gloucestershire to help clear shingle from the walkway. Elsewhere, the A487 in Newgale, Pembrokeshire, has been reopened after tonnes of shingle washed onto it during the storm. Engineers spent several days using earth moving equipment to move the shingle off the road and back onto the beach. Massive waves But it was Aberystwyth that was hardest hit by the heavy rain, strong winds and high tides. The town's shelter partly fell into a hole after its foundations were washed away as massive waves pounded the seafront on 6 January. Cadw, the body which looks after Wales' historic monuments for the Welsh government, has told Ceredigion council it wants the shelter to be repaired and replaced in its current position. The council has said it does not know how long the dismantling process will take or how much it will cost. But it is hoping to have the full length of road along the promenade from the harbour car park to the base of Constitution Hill open by late Sunday night. A council spokesman said the local authority would be able to start accessing the damage to the promenade walkway on Monday. ""Early signs are that there are three main areas to repair between the bandstand and Constitutional Hill,"" he said. ""Depending on weather conditions, the aim is to enable the public to use the promenade by Easter Monday, apart from the area which will remain fenced off around the bathhouse shelter."" Finally succumbed Aberystwyth seafront shelter has been used by couples, rowdy students, sodden holidaymakers and the homeless since it was built in the 1920s. The building has survived major storms in 1927 and 1938 and a plan to demolish it in 2010. But it finally succumbed to the elements during storms that lashed the seaside town last week. The Bath Rock shelter was built around 1923/24 and the earliest photograph is on a book from 1925. A Bath House had previously been on the site between 1810 and 1892. Local historian and former curator of Aberystwyth-based Ceredigion museum, Michael Freeman, said: ""Water was drawn in from the sea by a horse-drawn pump and heated up by a boiler to enable people who weren't able to go into the sea to have a bath or shower."" He added the bath house's foundations may be the root-cause of the serious damage to the shelter last week. ""The waves were able to punch a hole through the foundations because it would have been filled in with rubble when the shelter was built,"" he said. But it survived two major storms in the first two decades of its existence on 28 October 1927 and on 14 January 1938. The devastation caused by the hurricane-force winds that hit Aberystwyth seafront in 1938 was recorded by British Pathe in the aftermath of the storm. The cost of last week's storm is not known yet but the total bill in 1938 was Â£70,000 or about Â£2.5m by today's standards. In 2010 Ceredigion Council proposed to replace the two public shelters on the prom with new ones at a cost of Â£60,000. At the time the council said the shelter was becoming too costly to repair. But it was restored rather than scrapped in 2011 after it was made a grade II-listed building by Cadw.","Two hundred people volunteered to help with a clean-up of Aberystwyth promenade, a week after it was damaged by storms."
"Condor Ferries moved its Channel Island sailings from Weymouth to Poole in February amid structural problems which forced the closure of Weymouth Quay. The council said it expected to be in a position to award the building contract at the beginning of October. Its management committee unanimously approved Â£2m of works to allow the quay to reopen in March 2013. Under the plan, the quay would be rebuilt and a new terminal created. Advance works, including the removal of a walkway canopy and filling a void which had opened up in the structure, were completed in time for the 2012 Olympic sailing events in Weymouth and Portland. The authority said it was losing about Â£650,000 a year while Condor sailed from Poole. A spokesperson for Condor Ferries said: ""We look forward to hearing about the appointment of the contractor and finding out more about the project's completion dates.""","Repairs to a Dorset ferry terminal could start in October, according to Weymouth and Portland Borough Council."
"The Department for Transport will test noise-detecting cameras in various locations over the next seven months. The move comes after pressure from campaigners in rural communities who say some motorists illegally modify vehicles to amplify the sound. A motorcyclist group said bikers must ""embrace"" the change. Much like the way a speed camera works, if a microphone in an acoustic camera detects a vehicle breaching legal noise limits, it triggers a camera to take pictures of the vehicle registration number and any other relevant images to allow a fine to be sent out to the vehicle owner, the government said. The noise level deemed to be inappropriate is yet to be decided. All vehicles must comply with noise regulations to legally use the roads. But Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the cameras could help to combat the fact that police resources are too stretched for officers to easily enforce noise regulations on ""boy racers in souped-up vehicles"". ""This technology could provide an alternative to make sure those communities are protected against excessive noise, that the people who are acting illegally are prosecuted... it's a simpler, easier way of doing it,"" he said. Dr Jonathan Moore, who chairs a campaign group lobbying to reduce noise along the A32 in the South Downs National Park, said people are ""thoroughly fed up"" with motorcyclists who drive through villages ""hundreds of times a year"" at anti-social hours. While he welcomed the trial, he said he does not believe technology is advanced enough for acoustic cameras to prevent noise problems in rural areas. ""Where there are wide open spaces, I am not entirely sure that this will be effective,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Motorcycle Industry Association said cameras could reduce nuisance noise if they were used in the right way. Chief executive Tony Campbell said: ""Motorcycle manufacturers accept that they have a role to play and I think you'll see it more difficult to start tampering with vehicles in the future."" ""As an industry we're playing our part,"" he added.","Motorists with vehicles breaching legal noise limits could face fines if new ""acoustic camera"" technology is developed, the government has said."
"He told the Guardian he would stay in post while there were ""momentous events taking place in Parliament"". He added that it was not ""sensible to vacate the chair"" at the moment. However, Women and Equalities Committee chair Maria Miller disagreed, insisting ""no MP should stand by and allow the Speaker to continue in his post."" BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar says Mr Bercow's announcement is potentially a Brexit game-changer, which will anger a lot of Brexiteers because they suspect - rightly - that he is ready to help MPs construct a parliamentary roadblock to a no-deal exit. After his first election nearly 10 years ago, Mr Bercow said he intended to serve no more than nine years. He has since been re-elected unopposed again in 2015 and 2017. But on Tuesday, he told the Guardian newspaper: ""I've never said anything about going in July of this year. ""Secondly, I do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn't seem to me sensible to vacate the chair."" Mr Bercow has faced claims of anti-Brexit bias and overruling precedent on ""a number of key votes"". On Tuesday, he dismissed claims from some Brexiteers that because a no-deal exit is the default position in law, it will ""inevitably"" happen if no agreement is reached by 31 October with Brussels. And in March, he controversially ruled out MPs voting on Prime Minister Theresa May's deal for a third time unless the government asked a different question. Speaking to the BBC, Brexit Minister James Cleverly said he had ""long known that the House of Commons and the Speaker will do everything they can to prevent a no-deal Brexit."" Bullying The Speaker was also criticised after a report last year concluded that bullying and harassment in the House of Commons were not being dealt with due to an atmosphere of ""acquiescence and silence"". Conservative MP Mrs Miller said: ""The Cox Report was clear that the House of Commons needs a wholesale change in leadership... ""The Cox report specifically includes the Speaker in that recommendation, the most senior person in the House of Commons - no MP should stand by and allow the Speaker to continue in his post."" Mr Bercow has also personally faced allegations of bullying, which he denies. Analysis: By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent Between the lines of John Bercow's words is a message to the wannabe prime ministers. His intervention is a timely reminder to the Tory leadership contenders touting a deal or no-deal Brexit on 31 October that it may not be as simple as that. MPs have shown they will find ways to prevent the UK leaving the EU without a deal. And the Speaker has shown he is not shy of taking controversial decisions and setting parliamentary precedent. To some he is facilitating due scrutiny of the government, others accuse him of manipulating the process. But what matters is what the majority of MPs want and whether they can assert their will. John Bercow said Brexit had ""whetted the appetite"" of Parliament to have its say. The path may not be clear, the rules as yet unwritten, but it sounds like the Speaker may be preparing for a feast. Other MPs welcomed the Speaker's plan to continue, including shadow minister Steve Reed who tweeted: ""Speaker Bercow is quite right to stay on until the Brexit crisis is over, Parliament and the country needs his experience."" Labour MP Chris Bryant has said that when Mr Bercow does stand down, his successor must focus on ""tending to the wounds"" caused by Brexit rows and harassment scandals. Meanwhile, two female MPs - Gloria De Piero and Nicky Morgan - have called for the next Speaker to be a woman. What is the role of the Speaker? The Speaker, elected by MPs, is in charge of keeping order in the House of Commons. They pick MPs to speak in debates and can suspend those who deliberately break the rules. They also select which amendments will be voted on and decide whether or not to grant emergency debates and urgent questions. In addition to these duties any new Speaker will have to handle allegations of bullying and harassment in Westminster. The position is an impartial role and, once elected, the Speaker is expected to resign from their party. Read more on the Speaker's role. What questions do you have about Brexit?

"The firm went into administration last month. Highlands and Islands Enterprise has been selected as the preferred bidder to take over the assets of the company. But administrators KMPG said they had been unable to sell the business as a going concern, so the remaining staff will now lose their jobs. Edinburgh-based Pelamis Wave Power had employed more than 50 staff in the design, manufacture and operation of wave energy converters which it had been testing at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney. New body Administrators were called in after Pelamis failed to secure enough funding to develop its technology. The majority of Pelamis employees were made redundant following the joint administrators' appointment. The Scottish government announced it was establishing a public innovation company Wave Energy Scotland following Pelamis' demise and pledged to offer job opportunities for some of its staff. Highlands and Islands Enterprise is responsible for setting up the new body and delivering on its remit. Blair Nimmo, joint administrator and head of restructuring at KPMG in Scotland, said: ""Following the sales process, I am pleased to confirm that Highland and Islands Enterprise has been appointed preferred bidder in relation to acquiring the assets of Pelamis Wave Power Limited. ""Over the coming days we will be working to finalise the sale and are hopeful that the transaction can be concluded in the near future. ""Unfortunately, as no going concern solution has been found, the remaining staff will shortly be made redundant. We are working with government agencies to ensure employees obtain as much assistance as possible."" 'Great pity' A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are very pleased that Wave Energy Scotland has been named by KPMG as the preferred bidder for some of the assets of Pelamis Wave Power. ""It was always our aim to retain the intellectual property from device development in Scotland for future benefit. ""The HIE team delivering Wave Energy Scotland is now engaging with KPMG to complete the purchase."" She added: ""Scotland is determined to remain at the forefront of wave power innovation. ""We are delighted that these valuable intellectual assets will remain in Scotland and form the foundation of Wave Energy Scotland's programme."" WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: ""It really is a great pity to see Pelamis Wave Power close and staff lose their jobs. ""Marine renewables have the potential to play an important role in our future energy mix, helping to cut climate emissions and create jobs around our coastline.

"The cash from the We Love Manchester Emergency Fund will go to those who were in the foyer of the Arena on 22 May when the bomb was detonated or accessed it immediately afterwards. It is the first time cash from the fund has been made available to those without physical injuries. Up to 300 people could be eligible to receive a payment of Â£10,000. 'Functionally impaired' The payments will go to people deemed to have been ""functionally impaired"" and are no longer able to do things they could prior to the attack. Their presence on the night will be verified by Greater Manchester Police. Those who have already received payments of Â£60,000 or more from the fund will not be eligible. Earlier this month the police said 512 people were known to have been injured in the Manchester attack - including those with physical and psychological injuries. Sue Murphy, chair of the board of trustees of the fund, said: ""The people in the foyer of the Manchester Arena that night saw and heard things that none of us should ever have to see or hear. ""I am proud to be leading a charity which treats psychological injury as seriously as it treats physical injury."" She added that anyone experiencing psychological distress who was not in the arena that night should contact the Greater Manchester Resilience Hub. The We Love Manchester Emergency Fund was started hours after the blast. With the latest payments, Â£14m of the Â£18m fund will have been distributed. The first payments were made in June to the families of the bereaved, people who were in hospital for more than seven days and those who were hospitalised overnight.",Up to Â£3m from a fund for victims of the Manchester attack is to be given to those with psychological injuries.
"The court ruled Stylus Sports, which ran a bingo hall and amusement arcade on the pier, was entitled to a payout over the emergency closure in 2006. The pier was closed to the public after it was found to be structurally unsafe. It was further damaged by fire in 2010. The council said paying compensation would cut its spending elsewhere. Samuel Townend, barrister for Stylus Sports, said the company had been unable to do any business after the pier was shut. 'Loss of goodwill' ""Stylus Sports were concerned about the structural stability of the pier back in 2004,"" he said. ""They had structural surveys carried out and when Ravenclaw, who were their landlord, refused to do anything about it they passed that on to the council in January 2005. ""Had they acted earlier it is possible they could have avoided this compensation claim. ""There is loss of business and loss of business goodwill. It could come to several hundreds of thousands of pounds."" The East Sussex council bought the 140-year-old pier by compulsory purchase last year after Panamanian company Ravenclaw failed to respond to official notices to carry out repairs. Ravenclaw has not responded to approaches by the council for several years. Hastings Pier and White Rock Trust has now been awarded a Â£11.4m lottery grant to restore the structure and build a new visitor centre, with work expected to begin this summer. Kevin Boorman, spokesman for Hastings council, said the potential compensation bill was a ""massive amount of money"" that it would like to spend on the good of Hastings. ""This year we had to make 40 posts redundant because of budget cuts,"" he said. ""If we have to find that amount of money, that is (money) we can't be spending elsewhere.""",Hastings council faces a compensation claim of hundreds of thousands of pounds after losing a High Court battle over its closure of the town's pier.
"Lorna Fulton stood down from her role at Middlesbrough Town Hall in 2019 after the controversial entertainer was welcomed back to the venue. The tribunal between Ms Fulton and Middlesbrough Council was due to go ahead on Friday. However, it now no longer appears on the listings. In a now-deleted tweet, the former head of programming at the town hall said she was pleased the hearing was no longer going ahead and thanked her legal team. Officials from the employment tribunal offices in Newcastle confirmed to the Local Democracy Reporting Service that the case had been pulled ""out of the list"". 'Unwritten policy' Middlesbrough Council has declined to comment on the matter. In 2019, Middlesbrough Mayor Andy Preston scrapped an ""unwritten policy"" which apparently said the Grangetown-born comic, whose material some people find highly offensive, could not perform at the town hall. Ms Fulton stood down in response, and it is understood she and her family suffered abuse and threats of violence in the wake of her decision. Middlesbrough's Labour group has called on the council and Mr Preston to apologise to Ms Fulton for the distress she and her family had suffered. When it came to Chubby Brown performing, Mr Preston said he was a ""popular and controversial performer"". The mayor added: ""I personally don't like his brand of comedy but lots of people do. ""I don't believe it should be up to me, or anyone else, to decide which specific controversial comedians should be banned from Middlesbrough and which should be welcomed."" Mr Preston also condemned the abuse Ms Fulton had suffered. ""It's appalling that anyone should be subjected to such horrible abuse,"" he added. ""No-one deserves that.""

Among the actors posing for pictures were Martin Freeman, Sir Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly. The film is the culmination of director Sir Peter Jackson's The Hobbit trilogy. Sir Peter, 53, who finished editing the movie a week ago, said: ""Saying goodbye to the cast was like this agonising long torture over 10 weeks. ""But the real emotions will hit me in days to come."" The film stars Freeman as hobbit Bilbo Baggins alongside Sir Ian as Gandalf the Grey. Both actors paid tribute to the films' strong fan base and Sir Peter told the crowds: ""We hope you enjoy this film. We make it for you, for the fans and the people who enjoy these movies so I hope you like this one."" Freeman, 43, added: ""The reason I'm not sad is because we are handing it over to the audience and sharing it with you. You're the best fans in the world - you're loyal and mad - so thank you so much.""

"Unite is ""deeply concerned"" by plans which could see workers cut from the Hawk contract, servicing T1 and T2 jets. It was ""astounded"" at the proposals and ""deeply concerned"" the motive was political. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) and BAE Systems said they are committed to ongoing dialogue with employees. Unite said the plans would see work on the T1 moved to RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, which could lead to the loss of an initial 50-70 maintenance jobs at RAF Valley. ""In relation to the T2 Hawk there is a threat of greater job losses in the proposal, which could see a further over 100 jobs lost by 2033 based on the figures supplied to Unite,"" said a spokesman. 'Wrong time, wrong reasons' Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who is the MP for the Richmond area of Yorkshire, has championed bringing work to RAF Leeming and had hoped the Red Arrows would move there. Peter Hughes, Unite regional secretary, said the rationale for moving the T1 Hawk work to RAF Leeming ""does not add up."" ""We believe these are the wrong proposals at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons,"" Mr Hughes said. ""The MoD should be investing in the RAF Valley workforce for the long term rather than looking to cut jobs.""

Officers found him unresponsive outside the station at 05:30. PC Bhupinder Kalsi, based at Hillingdon borough, was dismissed without notice. Mr Malagardis's dog had been placed in Uxbridge Police Station kennels while he was treated at a nearby hospital the previous day.

After remaining ""for some time"" Mr Malagardis was physically removed from the station when he began to smoke for a second time. PC Kalsi then ""viewed a DVD whilst on duty, following Mr Malagardis' ejection from the front office,"" the Met's Unsatisfactory Police Performance meeting found.

"By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter Peter Mandelson Perhaps the most famous non-quitter of them all. In 2001, New Labour's ""prince of darkness"" was seething with indignation at twice being ejected from Tony Blair's cabinet. It all came boiling over in one extraordinary moment at his general election count. ""It was said that I was facing political ruin,"" said the newly re-elected Hartlepool MP, his voice straining with emotion. ""My career in tatters, apparently never to be part of the political living again."" Dramatic pause. ""Well, they underestimated Hartlepool. And they underestimated me. Because I am fighter and not a quitter!"" Mandelson's jaw-jutting, eyes-blazing cry of defiance drew ridicule from some but it worked like a charm. He did quit as an MP two years later - but only so he could be rehabilitated as a European Commissioner, and then, in one of the biggest comebacks in UK political history, as Gordon Brown's second-in-command and a member of the House of Lords. Others have had less luck with the phrase... Iain Duncan Smith IDS may hold the record for the shortest period between saying ""I'm not a quitter"" and quitting. The then Tory leader told his critics exactly what sort of character they were dealing with on the morning of 29 October 2003. ""I'm not a quitter,"" he declared ahead of a confidence vote by his MPs. By 7pm he was gone. Richard Nixon The disgraced US president first uttered the phrase in a speech in 1952, when he denied accusations he had abused a political expenses fund, in a groundbreaking televised address. It worked - and he was able to keep his place as Eisenhower's running mate. He reached for it again 22 years later in another televised speech, announcing his resignation as president over the Watergate scandal. ""I've never been a quitter,"" he told the American people, before proving himself wrong. George Osborne ""George is not a quitter. Nobody is going to back him into a corner,"" Mr Osborne's constituency agent told the Daily Mirror on the Sunday after the EU referendum. Theresa May didn't seem overly concerned about Mr Osborne's proud non-quitter status, however, and promptly fired him as chancellor. He stood down as Tatton MP 10 months after that. David Cameron ""Brits don't quit - we get involved, we take a lead, we make a difference, we get things done,"" said David Cameron in the run-up to June 2016's EU referendum. But he turned out to be one Brit who did quit - on the morning after losing the referendum, despite earlier insisting that he would stay in office whatever the result. Gordon Brown Mr Brown never uttered the immortal phrase. But he had it thrown at him by his great political friend Tony Blair, who according to a book by Sky News political editor Adam Boulton, thought Mr Brown would stand down before the 2010 general election because ""history showed Mr Brown to be a quitter not a fighter"". This sly reference to Peter Mandelson's dramatic show of defiance prompted a furious round of denials from Mr Brown. ""When you've set off on a journey, you have got to complete that journey,"" he said. His particular journey ended with defeat at the 2010 general election.","In a show of defiance, Theresa May has told her critics: ""I am not a quitter."" It's a phrase much loved by football managers facing the sack but politicians have used it a lot too, with decidedly mixed results."
"Economic and political uncertainty, fresh demands from airlines, and delays in approval for further expansion are behind the rethink, bosses said. The terminal was due to open in 2020, as part of an ongoing Â£600m plan to create capacity and improve facilities at the Essex airport. Stansted is consulting with airlines to ""future-proof"" the building. The airport said uncertainty over what border controls would be required after Brexit and wider economic doubts had also influenced the review. It is reconsidering the interior design of the building, to ensure it can use new technologies and install facilities - such as passenger lounges - that will appeal to the long-haul operators it wants to attract. It has also been waiting for more than a year for approval from Uttlesford District Council for its plan to increase passenger numbers. Stansted currently handles 28 million passengers a year, and has permission to increase capacity to 35 million. It wants to increase that number to 43 million. Brian Ross, of campaign group Stop Stansted Expansion, said there had been a recent dip in passenger numbers at the airport. ""There are a bunch of reasons for it but the fact is that Stansted is in decline rather than moving ahead,"" he said. ""So why would they have any urgency to build a new arrivals terminal? There isn't that urgency."" The airport denied passenger numbers had been a factor in reviewing the terminal.",Stansted Airport has put its new Â£150m arrivals terminal on hold while it reviews the plans.
"The made-up Elwyn Davies was second only to UKIP MEP Nathan Gill in name recognition, ahead of Jill Evans, Derek Vaughan and Kay Swinburne. The figures emerged in the 2016 Welsh Election Study. Cardiff University's Professor Roger Scully said voters were ""unlikely to notice"" the loss of MEPs after Brexit. But Mr Vaughan, a Wales MEP since 2009, said it is ""difficult"" for MEPs to get recognition. Prof Roger Scully, principal investigator for the Cardiff University-led 2016 Welsh Election Study, said it was probably unsurprising that Mr Gill came top given his higher profile role in the assembly election campaign. ""But none of the other Welsh MEPs were selected by a greater proportion of the study respondents than that legendary figure in Welsh politics 'Elwyn Davies' - whose contributions to our national political life I feel I need not elaborate upon,"" he said. Prof Scully, who spent the early part of his career studying in the European Parliament, said most MEPs are ""very hard-working individuals"". But he added: ""We will, of course, very likely be losing our MEPs when the UK leaves the EU. ""But on these results, it seems fair to say that most of the Welsh public are unlikely to notice."" Those surveyed were asked: ""Wales is represented by four members in the European Parliament. Which, if any, of the following people are among Wales' four representatives in the European Parliament?"" They were given only 30 seconds to answer, to prevent them from searching on the internet, and were given the choices of four entirely made-up names and two real MEPs. The findings suggest that Wales's four MEPs - UKIP's Mr Gill, Plaid Cymru's Ms Evans, Labour's Mr Vaughan and the Conservatives's Ms Swinburne - were picked out by members of the public who saw the names with a breakdown of 16%, 11%, 9% and 6% respectively. But the made-up Elwyn Davies was chosen by 12% of those who saw ""his"" name, beating all the MEPs apart from Mr Gill. Out of the remaining made-up names, David Sherwood was picked by 5%, Lynn Goodwin 5% and Jenny Green 5%. Labour MEP Mr Vaughan, in response to the Welsh Election Study press release, said: ""I have offices in South Wales and North Wales and do regular visits across the constituency but it is impossible to try to cover all of Wales in a way which ensures people recognise you."" The data was collected by YouGov via the internet in March 2016 and 3,272 people responded.","A fictitious MEP was recognised by a greater percentage of people than three real ones, a survey has suggested."
"Inverness Properties secured planning permission in 2014 for 16 homes at Viewhill, which is about half a mile from the location of the battle. The site has now been taken over by Aberdeenshire-based Kirkwood Homes. The 1745 Association has reiterated earlier opposition to the development because research suggests the site has close links to the battle. Kirkwood Homes has sought permission from Highland Council for what it calls ""minor alterations"" to the plans. Highland councillors had refused Inverness Properties planning permission. But, following an appeal by the developer, a Scottish government-appointed planning official granted permission with conditions in January 2014. The reporter agreed with Historic Scotland that it was unlikely that the proposal would have ""any impact on the character and ambience of the battlefield"". Fought on 16 April 1746 near Inverness, Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his Jacobite force were defeated at Culloden by a government army led by the Duke of Cumberland. The fighting took place over a wider area than the parts of the battlefield that are in the care of the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), which opposed the original plans for Viewhill. In a new statement, the 1745 Association said research suggested the government's lines may have extended to the site of the planned housing development. NTS added that when it originally opposed the housing project it was concerned it would lead to further development around the battlefield.

"The 35-year-old posted a video on Twitter of Millard Scott falling downstairs after being Tasered by officers in north London, in April. Speaking to ITV News, Mr Scott, 62, said he believed he would not have been Tasered if he were white. The Met Police said a review had found ""no indication of misconduct"". A spokesman for the force said officers went to the property as part of ""a long-running operation to tackle drugs supply linked to serious violence"". The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for an urgent investigation by the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Describing the incident as ""distressing"", Mr Khan said: ""It is absolutely vital that our police service retains the trust of the communities it serves."" Scotland Yard later said it would not refer the incident to the IOPC. It comes amid global protests against racism, inequality and police brutality, following the death of George Floyd, 46, in Minneapolis, in the US, after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck. Thousands of people have attended largely peaceful demonstrations across the UK in recent days to mark Mr Floyd's death, and highlight racial inequality in Britain. Wretch 32, whose real name is Jermaine Scott, shared the 36-second clip on his Twitter account with the caption: ""This is how the police think they can treat a 62 year old black man in Tottenham but this 1 happens to be my dad."" It shows Mr Scott falling down the stairs after an officer is heard to warn: ""Police officer with a Taser. Stay where you are.""

He said: ""The only people who have invaded our space are the Metropolitan Police. The only people who seem to ignore the guidelines put out there are the Metropolitan Police. ""It seems at this moment in time we are being singled out and targeted."" How often are Tasers used? Last year, police forces in England and Wales used Tasers on 22,059 occasions - but in only 2,473 occasions were they actually fired. On most occasions, the Tasers were drawn and aimed, but not actually discharged. Proportionally, black people have the weapons used against them eight times more often than white people. The use of Tasers has more than doubled in the five years to 2018-19, as more police forces are equipped with them. The College of Policing says that police officers must clearly communicate their intention to use the weapon and any use must be ""proportionate, lawful, accountable and absolutely necessary"". Wretch 32 told the broadcaster that there has been ""no progression"" and he now warns his own children to be wary of the police. He said: ""I've grown up in a household with a dad and uncle and I've watched them fight against police brutality.

'Contamination risk' ""We have noticed a significant and widespread increase in personal protective equipment being littered all over the country. So that's gloves and masks,"" she said. ""They are not only an environmental hazard, because they quite often contain plastic which is really damaging to our wildlife and our water systems, but they also pose a particular contamination risk.

"By Nicola BeckfordBBC Radio 4, The World at One A fifth of those on a DVLA ""high-risk register"" have been on it before. There are calls for more stringent checks before offenders are given back their licences. The government said it had tightened up rules, and drivers now had to prove they were no longer alcohol-dependent. Drink-drivers who are more than two and a half times over the legal limit, who have two or more drink-drive offences within a 10-year period or who refuse to give breath, blood or urine samples, are classed by the DVLA as ""high-risk offenders"". Using the Freedom of Information Act, the BBC discovered there are currently 230,149 banned drivers on the DVLA's scheme and of these, 42,207 drivers had been on it before. Their licences had been returned because they were considered safe to drive when their initial ban expired. But under rules introduced in June, when a ban expires, offenders can reapply for their licence only when they have passed a medical test to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent. However, this will apply only to new offenders - those convicted earlier can drive after reapplying for their driving licence. Provisional figures released on Thursday show that 280 people were killed in drink-drive accidents in 2012, an increase of about 17% compared with 2011. This accounts for 16% of all road deaths in Britain. Overall, deaths were down 8% on 2011, at 1,754. Police and road safety campaigners say the system of dealing with drink-drivers needs to be re-examined. 'Bitter experience' Insp Richard Auty, who has investigated collisions for the Metropolitan Police for 17 years, said he was surprised by the DVLA figure, adding that it was ""quite large"". He expressed doubts that the new testing system would address the problem. ""I suspect from the people that I've dealt with that whilst it will deal with the worst offenders, the binge drinkers that are able to control it will clearly not turn up to a medical drunk, so it won't effectively deal with those people. So I would suggest a mandatory driving test or extended driving test before you get your licence back would be a much greater deterrent."" In 2009, Anish Patel's wife, Catriona, 39, was killed by a serial offender while cycling to work. She was crushed under the wheels of his lorry outside Oval tube station in south London. The driver had three previous drink-driving convictions, had been disqualified 20 times and had three previous convictions for reckless driving. Mr Patel said: ""It was just a normal day and a few phone calls later and hours later your whole life gets turned upside down and changed forever. She was my best friend, she was the love of my life, she was my soulmate, we did absolutely everything together."" He felt angry and bitter when he learned about the driver's previous convictions. ""I just thought the biggest thing that shouldn't have happened that day was him being on the road and driving a 40-tonne tipper truck fully laden through one of the busiest junctions through central London. ""These people obviously are not operating by the same rules of the vast majority of the population operate by and I think that there has to be something done about serial offenders. It is too common an occurrence that people get convicted of drink-driving and they are back on the road either illegal or unfortunately legally. "" 'Get carried away' Johnny, a former serial drink-driver who stopped drinking through Alcoholics Anonymous, was caught three times in nine weeks. He was banned for two years and continued to drink-drive for 15 years but was never caught again. He said: ""I always thought of the consequences but unfortunately just the following morning. I was just going out for one or two drinks, get a bit carried away and invariably I'd end up drink-driving. ""I'm not convinced that a tougher sentence would have made any difference. How much tougher do you want it to be? You're going to lose your liberty, you're going to lose your job, you're going to lose your home. You're going to lose everything basically if you do it again. That never stopped me from driving."" Amy Aeron-Thomas, executive director of RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, said it was time to review driving bans and increase the number of breathalyser tests. ""There is public support for a five-year ban for first-time offenders. Now you are talking about repeat offenders, big-risk offenders - they deserve lengthy driving bans if not losing their licence permanently. ""We know with the decrease in road policing there are fewer breathalyser tests being given so there is a greater chance of them getting away with it."" Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ""Drink-drivers are a menace and it is right that we do everything we can to keep the most high-risk offenders off the road. ""That is why we have tightened up the rules which mean that they now have to take medical tests to prove they are no longer alcohol-dependent before being allowed to drive."" You can hear more on this report on BBC Radio 4's World at One at 13:00, or listen to it online here.","As new figures show the number of people killed in drink-driving crashes rose by 17%, the BBC has discovered that thousands of drink-drivers are repeat offenders."
"Southend and Broomfield hospitals said they were at the highest level of pressure, declaring internal critical incidents. However, Southend denied it was on high alert, despite a leaked email saying it had missed waiting time targets. Both said they had cancelled routine operations on Wednesday to cope. A leaked email to staff at Southend revealed 277 patients were admitted on Monday, with 101 being dealt with after the government's four-hour wait target. In the email, Southend's medical director Neil Rothnie said it had issued the internal critical incident due to the number of acutely unwell patients arriving at the emergency department. Mr Rothnie said that on the night and early hours of 1 and 2 January there were ""no medical or surgical beds"". He said ""ambulances were queuing for considerable periods of time throughout the night"" with many patients ""waiting for considerable time in the emergency department for speciality beds"". The hospital declared full capacity in the early hours of 2 January. As a consequence clinics were cancelled to free up clinicians. But a spokesperson denied the hospital was on high alert. ""An 'internal critical incident' is an escalation term used within the Trust that enables us to quickly mobilise nurses and clinicians,"" Yvonne BlÃ¼cher of Southend University NHS Foundation Trust said. She added that by cancelling clinics and non-urgent meetings, it could ""redeploy staff to clinical areas and keep patients safe should they require admission"". Meanwhile, a spokesman for Broomfield said it had been ""consistently busy"" over the holiday period. ""We are on internal significant incident and working with all of our partners across the system including EEAST [East of England Ambulance Service Trust] to ensure that the sickest patients are triaged and treated without delay,"" he said.",Two hospitals in Essex have reached capacity as a result of very high demand for services this winter.
"It is one of the highest stretches of motorway in the country, covering 36 miles (57.9km) between Lancaster and Penrith. The road, which incorporates the Lune Gorge, was opened on 23 October 1970. Photographs of the construction of the motorway, by John Laing Construction Ltd, have been preserved in a special Historic England archive. At the time, it was the highest section of motorway in the country at Shap, at 316m (1037ft) above sea level. The surveys for the M6 through Cumbria were done from the air, which was a first for the UK. Work on the Lune Gorge section of the road, between Killington and Tebay, began in October 1967 with construction carried out by civil engineering specialists John Laing Construction Ltd. At the time the weather and ground conditions were some of the most challenging faced by UK engineers, according to Highways England, which operates the motorway. Almost a thousand road workers were involved in the project, which had five separate construction contracts making up the new Lancaster to Penrith route. Mike Gellatley, a fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers and former London Underground chief engineer, remembered working on the project which was ""a constant battle against the elements"". ""Residents in the area were initially sceptical about the motorway but it totally transformed journeys,"" he said. ""In the days before the M6, a journey up to the to the far north and Scotland was a torturous adventure with vehicles often having to queue in winter to get past snow along the A6 at Shap."" The Roger Howe Bridge over the River Lune was built for the re-routed A685 during the construction of the M6, through the Lune Gorge. Keith Little, of Cumbria County Council, called the motorway a ""vital part"" of the development of the county's transport network. ""It made the county more accessible to the rest of the country and has enabled local businesses and residents to trade, travel and connect with the wider region,"" he said. The Lancaster to Penrith M6 was officially opened by Transport Industries minister John Peyton on 23 October 1970. At 236 miles (379km), running from Rugby in Warwickshire to the Scottish border, the M6 is the longest motorway in the country. It was not completed until 2008 when the Highways Agency finished converting the A74 between Carlisle and Gretna Green.

"Mr Corbyn is a guest speaker at an event at the FÃ©ile an Phobail in Belfast. He said he felt there was ""quite a lot of common ground"" among the NI parties. ""There has been some talks already but I think it has to go a lot further,"" he said. ""If we go down the road of imposing those welfare cuts and the cuts in living standards surely that has an effect on the political process, I think we need to have further discussions,"" Mr Corbyn added. ""I hope that the attempt at unification of all the Northern Ireland parties around this issue are going to be fruitful and the British government will talk again."" Northern Ireland's five main political parties signed the Stormont House Agreement last December. It was a wide-ranging deal that addressed some of Stormont's current financial difficulties, after a reduction in its block grant from Westminster. Sinn FÃ©in withdrew its support for the bill in March because of a row over the implementation of welfare reforms. Last week, Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness met representatives from the US State Department and influential Irish Americans, asking them to lobby the British government to give more financial support to Stormont. His trip coincided with a diplomatic visit to the US by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers, who has said a budget increase is not an option. Andy Burnham, Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall are the other candidates in the Labour Party leadership contest. Ballot papers will be sent out on 14 August, with the result to be announced at a special conference on 12 September.",Labour Party leadership contender Jeremy Corbyn has urged the Prime Minister to enter new talks with the Northern Ireland parties over the welfare reform budget.
"The chairman and CEO of News Corporation feared the scandal was threatening to taint other titles published under his UK operation, News International. However, the company has since been beset by further allegations of hacking and corruption, and has led to - among other things - the withdrawal of a bid to take full control of satellite broadcaster BSkyB, the arrest of numerous Sun journalists, and the resignation of Mr Murdoch's son James from several positions in the family business. A lawyer at the centre of phone-hacking litigation has warned that claims could also be brought against News Corporation in the US. Yet despite his company's involvement in several inquiries and police operations, Mr Murdoch - now 81 years old - has taken an increasingly hands-on approach to its problems. His profile as a key player in News International's fate became particularly prominent after he was questioned by British MPs in July 2011 - a meeting which was disrupted when an onlooker attacked the media mogul with a foam pie, leaving Mr Murdoch's young wife leaping to his rescue. He later went on to launch the Sun on Sunday, which sold 3.26 million copies in its first week - a figure not bettered by any UK newspaper for four years. The octogenarian even took to Twitter - reaching out to supporters and attacking further allegations against the company. He also agreed to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry into press standards. In July 2012, Mr Murdoch announced that he had resigned from a string of directorships controlling News Corp's UK newspapers - at NI Group Ltd, NewsCorp Investments and Times Newspaper Holdings. News Corp plans to split into two companies, separating its publishing interests from the more lucrative TV and film side. Mr Murdoch is expected to chair both businesses but to be chief executive only of the TV and film enterprise. Political manipulation Mr Murdoch, who inherited a taste for the press from his father, is no stranger to controversy. He began his career aged 22 when his father Sir Keith, one of Australia's most distinguished newspapermen, died and left his son a half share in two Adelaide papers. Born in Australia in 1931, Oxford-educated Murdoch had a natural flair for popular journalism and a tendency to fall out with his editors. Although he spent much of his career denying he interfered too much. ""I think that I give my editors tremendous freedom and the only people who claim that I don't give them enough freedom now are the people who wouldn't know how to use it,"" he once said. There was steel beneath the boyish exterior, as the British discovered when he arrived in 1968 to buy the News of the World. Within a year he had added the ailing Sun newspaper, relaunching it as an irreverent tabloid. Circulation soared thanks to its sex-and-sensation formula and it went on to became Britain's biggest-selling daily paper. But his papers were frequently accused of political manipulation, distorting the news to ensure his political allies won elections. His critics, of which there are many, have called him a vulgarian and a cynic who had degraded standards of journalism by pandering to a sensation-seeking public. His loyal admirers have always heaped praise onto him, applauding the businessman for his ruthlessness, energy, and astonishing willingness to take risks. In 1986, by now owner of the Times and Sunday Times as well, Mr Murdoch moved all four newspaper titles into a heavily fortified printing plant, and sacked 5,000 workers. The ensuing battles with pickets outside Fortress Wapping heralded a revolution in Fleet Street, and an end to over-manning and restrictive practices. A television revolution followed. Already the owner of the Sun, he went on to introduce Sky, the satellite TV service to Britain. Setbacks Despite critics calling it downmarket rubbish, satellite dishes soon became commonplace and Sky gobbled up its rival, BSB, to become hugely profitable. Before long, Sky could afford to bid more than hundreds of millions of pounds for the television rights to Premier League football. In June 2010, News Corp had been bidding to take over the 61% of BSkyB it did not already own. But the company abandoned the bid in July 2011 after the phone-hacking scandal emerged. In the US, where Mr Murdoch had bought 20th Century Fox, he won a bigger prize, establishing America's fourth television network. Along the way, he became a US citizen to circumvent rules banning foreigners from owning television stations. Fox shows like the Simpsons cartoon series sold around the world, but Mr Murdoch continued to suffer setbacks. In the 1980s his empire nearly crashed when its debts mounted to a staggering eight billion dollars. He survived to buy Star TV in Hong Kong, broadcasting by satellite to the whole of Asia. When the digital revolution swept television, promising many more channels, pay-per-view programmes, home shopping and home banking, Mr Murdoch's TV stations were at the forefront. But in Britain his monopoly of digital broadcasting technology led to fruitless calls for new rules to limit power. He dismissed any suggestion that he was too powerful. Global media mogul ""People say we're anti-competitive, when we do something which is open for anybody in the world to do,"" he once said. He closed down one newspaper, the loss-making Today in 1995, partly out of pique when the British government passed laws limiting how much of the media one company can control. During the Conservative's reign in the 80s and early 90s, Mr Murdoch's publications were generally supportive of the government, but that all changed when John Major eventually left Number 10. Prior to his election, Mr Murdoch invited Tony Blair to Australia. He also told his papers to tone down their attacks on Labour. The Sun went further, to the surprise of many, endorsing Blair at the 1997 election. But Mr Murdoch backed winners and made it clear that once the Labour Party's fortunes declined, it would switch allegiance. Mr Murdoch's involvement with politicians does not stop at the British government. He has had dealings with Canadian Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, US President Barack Obama and the former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd over the years. Married three times, he divorced his second wife, Anna, after 32 years together and tied the knot with TV executive Wendi Deng in June 1999. Mr Murdoch has always put his business interests first. He has taken huge gambles and created whole new industries. In the process, his opponents claimed, he manipulated governments, lowered standards and sidestepped regulations, to become the world's first truly global media mogul. He was stridently anti-monarchist in his views, rejecting the hereditary principle. Yet his sons Lachlan and James are primed to take up the reins of power in the Murdoch dynasty. In 2010, he was ranked the 13th most powerful person in the world in a list compiled by business magazine Forbes. Thought to be worth around $6.3 billion, he was ranked 117th wealthiest person in the world in 2011.","When media mogul Rupert Murdoch closed Britain's biggest newspaper, the News of the World, in July 2011 - after it became mired in allegations of phone hacking - he had hoped the move would draw a line under the scandal."

"At 35m (115ft) long, it is considered to be one of the longest in-situ corridor mosaics in the country. Visitors to the villa near Cirencester are able to watch archaeologists at work from suspended walkways which have been installed overlooking the mosaics. National Trust archaeologist Martin Papworth said: ""Hopefully we'll find some exciting things."" Victorian archaeologists uncovered and then reburied the mosaics about 150 years ago. Mr Papworth said his team were keen to see what lies beneath the soil. He said: ""We've lifted the old tarmac path that used to run along here when it was all outdoors and we're gradually working back through the 150 different layers worth of soil and we're excited by the bottom of it where we'll find this pattern mosaic."" The excavation is the culmination of Â£3m of redevelopment work which has seen Victorian buildings replaced, a new cafe built and a refurbished visitor centre opened at the villa. Archaeologists have been working since 2010 on the project to uncover the mosaics. David Thackray, head of archaeology at The National Trust, said the work being carried out was ""one of our most exciting archaeological projects and is something we've been trying to do for a very long time"". He said: ""This is going to be one of the longest mosaic corridors that is on public display in the country, if it all comes up nice and easily, and we hope it will add to visitors enjoyment when they come to Chedworth.""

"By Charlie JonesBBC News Anne Jones's family had owned the property in Easton Bavents near Southwold in Suffolk since 1925. A storm destroyed a large chunk of the cliff in December, leaving the building 30ft (9m) from the edge. It has since been demolished over a number of weeks, after being deemed unsafe by engineers, and the cliff has eroded by another 10ft (3m). ""The whole family is incredibly sad, my father won't even go down the lane because he can't bear to look at it. There is so much history there and we have rented it out to so many local people over the years,"" said Mrs Jones. ""It's quite depressing, it makes me angry. It feels so unfair that we have lost hundreds of acres of land and we just have to accept it, whereas more prosperous, populated areas get protected."" Easton Bavents was once a thriving village and England's most easterly point. Its church disappeared into the sea in the 17th Century and much of the land surrounding it has been eroded. Mrs Jones's great-grandfather Herbert Boggis used his life savings to buy the 400-acre estate in 1925, but it is now less than half that size. Over the past two decades, the house has crept closer to the cliff edge due to erosion. Juliet Blaxland rented part of the property, which is made up of three terraced cottages, from the family for 12 years. She was asked to move out just before Christmas. The author, who wrote a book about her time living there, said she was very sad to watch the house being dismantled and it was ""a great loss"" to the farm. Peter Boggis, who is Mrs Jones's mother's cousin, started building his own sea defences nearly 20 years ago to protect the area but was ordered to stop after losing a court battle. A government-funded scheme, which was approved in 2012 to help them relocate, did not work out and the landowners have been left to fend for themselves, Mrs Jones said. A spokesman for East Suffolk Council, which is part of the Coastal Partnership East group that manages the coast in the area, said it had ""worked hard... with property owners in Easton Bavents over the last 10 years to try and find ways to alleviate the challenges of losing your property to the sea"". He added they supported those who lose their property to erosion with a planning right to build elsewhere in the district. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

"The RSPCA comment came after an 8ft (2.44m) reticulated python was discovered near the Orwell Bridge, near Ipswich, on Monday. A black plastic bag and a pair of gloves were found near the snake. RSPCA inspector Jason Finch said no ""obvious health issues or injuries"" could account for the reptile's death. ""At this stage we do not know if the snake was dead when it was dumped at this location or if it had been abandoned and perished in the elements."" The charity said it was ""unlikely"" that it was an escapee as the location it was found in was relatively remote. ""Unfortunately, this sort of thing isn't unusual and we receive thousands of calls a year relating to reptiles, like snakes and lizards, many of which have been abandoned by their owners,"" said Mr Finch. ""Snakes often end up in our care when owners realise the commitment that is involved in meeting their needs and keeping them healthy."" Snakes are not able to produce their own body heat so they rely on their environment to maintain body temperatures. If they become too cold they may be unable to feed or move normally and their immune system will not work properly to fight disease, meaning the animal can become very ill.

"The Advertising Standards Authority said the companies did not do enough to prevent under-16s seeing the content. New rules governing children's advertising online came into force last July, adding to rules already in place for TV ads. The adverts featured on the companies' websites, apps or social media. In its ruling, ASA banned Cadbury's use of a storybook titled The Tale Of The Great Easter Bunny on its website, which featured children hunting for eggs. Chewits had four Facebook posts banned which featured Chewie the Chewitsaurus in a number of campaigns. And a so-called advergame app called Squashies World, where players match pairs of Squashies by flicking them towards each other, was also banned. Caroline Cerny of the Obesity Health Alliance said: ""Whilst today's rulings should be celebrated, the complaints demonstrate the blatant ways in which the food and drink industry attempts to exploit loopholes in the rules."" ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: ""The ban on HFSS [high in fat, salt or sugar] ads in children's online media is working, but it's important that we enforce it rigorously. ""These rulings show that we're doing that and will help advertisers understand where we're drawing the line."" Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, said it would now ""build upon our longstanding commitment to not market directly to children under the age of 16"". Swizzels, which makes Squashies, said the advergame it created was not designed to appeal to children and did not ""in any way"" encourage children to eat sweets. Chewits producer Cloetta said its Chewitsaurus was not ""developed to target under-16s"" and was instead targeted at ""parents and young adults"". Separately, YouTube star Zoella and Pointless Blog, run by her partner Alfie Dayes, were not found to have broken the ASA rules, after advertising the confectionary brand Ferrero.

"The explosion at Tilbury Port on 3 July was described as ""like a bomb going off"" with flames 75m (246ft) high. Essex Fire and Rescue said the cause of the fire was recorded as ""accidental"" and no-one was injured. ""Dust explosions like this are very rare but occur if the dust reaches a flammable temperature,"" it said. The port said it had commenced ""a phased start-up of operations at the terminal"" last week.

"Jean Davies, 86, did not suffer from a terminal illness but said her life had become ""intolerable"", and wanted to die in her own home. Her daughter Bronwen, a nurse from Cardiff, said her mother's death at home in Oxford followed a year of increasingly poor health. Mrs Davies died on 1 October. Before her death, she gave an interview to the Sunday Times speaking about her decision to end her life. Mrs Davies had seen a friend attempt suicide using medication, which had not worked, and she did not want to involve anyone else in helping her die as assisted suicide is illegal under UK law. She was suffering from episodes of unconsciousness and had worried about dying from one of these, and her family having to find her body in the house or garden. Bronwen Davies said her mother had had a number of chronic conditions and her health had dramatically declined. Mrs Davies had also had a series of mini strokes. ""She knew it was one of the things that could lead to a type of dementia,"" Ms Davies told BBC News. ""She was seen by a psychiatrist after she took the decision to end her life and she took full marks on the mini-mental test they did and was found to have capacity to make decisions about her own life."" 'She enjoyed life' Ms Davies said after her mother had had an illness which had taken away her appetite she made the decision not to start eating again. ""After the period of illness, she had five weeks where she didn't eat again. She mistakenly thought it would be quicker than it was once she stopped drinking water [after a few weeks]. ""She was very frustrated by how long it took her to die after she stopped drinking."" Ms Davies said her mother had been a very active person. She was a former maths teacher, including spending a period of time working at the now-closed Howardian School in Cardiff when her husband worked at Cardiff University. She became involved in the right-to-die campaign as far back as the 1970s and was president of the World Federation of Right to Die Societies from 1990 to 1992 and was chair of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society UK (now Dignity in Dying). ""It was very hard to accept that her life had become slowly, slowly, less satisfying to her,"" said her daughter. ""She was no longer able to get about. ""She was a fiercely independent woman. She enjoyed people, she enjoyed music, she enjoyed art. She enjoyed life. ""I think it would have been easier to accept if she had had a terminal illness and if she had been more unwell."" 'Proud' Asked why her mother had not chosen a faster method of dying, Ms Davies said she had talked in the past about the possibility of death through starvation. She had also realised that her action could raise awareness of the cause she had spent many years campaigning in support of, and had contacted her old colleagues at Dignity in Dying. ""I think it occurred to her after she started her course of action that it was something which could attract attention,"" Ms Davies said. ""She sought publicity after her decision."" Mrs Davies spent the first few weeks of her fast being visited by family and friends. ""She was having a wildly social time in the first two weeks,"" said her daughter. ""I had all the time to tell my mum what she meant to me. ""I spent the last four weeks in Oxford so I could be near her."" Ms Davies, who has a sister and two brothers, said watching her mother die was not easy, but added: ""I have always been proud of her. All the family are proud of her and how she did it.",A long-term campaigner for the right to die starved herself to death over five weeks because she could not have her life ended legally.

""Only last week the museum told me that they were 'focused on delivering a vibrant film festival programme', now they are announcing that they are abandoning the hugely popular Bradford International Film Festival.

"By Dominic HowellBBC News After hearing of the attack, beautician Katie Cutler set up an online donation page with the aim of raising just Â£500 - but the cause went viral. Mr Barnes is not the only person whose story has spurred on the UK general public to spontaneously donate. Here are some other examples: Claire Squires The cause? Marathon-runner Claire Squires set out to raise Â£500 for the charity Samaritans by taking part in the London Marathon in 2012. Sadly, she collapsed and died on the final stretch of the race. The 30-year-old hairdresser from North Kilworth, Leicestershire, had decided to donate to Samaritans because her mother Cilla Squires had volunteered there for 24 years. How it caught on? Miss Squires' story appeared in the national press and news of her online donation page went viral on social media networks Facebook and Twitter. Within days of her death, donations to Samaritans on her JustGiving page had exceeded Â£600,000. What happened next? Her death led to a grand total of more than Â£1m being given to the charity. More than 600 people attended her funeral. Stephen Sutton The cause? Before his death in May 2014, 19-year-old Stephen Sutton, who had cancer, launched an appeal to raise Â£10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. How it caught on? Stephen's campaign attracted global attention after a photo of the teenager went viral online. At one stage it accrued Â£60,000 in just over two hours as people retweeted and posted his story on Facebook and Twitter. What happened next? Stephen's campaign received about 340,000 donations and the eventual total raised for the trust reached almost Â£5m. Stephen was awarded a posthumous MBE. Ashraf Rossli The cause? Malaysian accountancy student Ashraf Rossli had been in the UK for just a month when he was attacked during the riots in London in 2012 - and then robbed by people pretending to help him. How it caught on? Footage of the incident, which left him with a broken jaw, was recorded on a mobile phone and posted on YouTube. It caused widespread anger, and an online donation page was set to up and raised Â£22,000 for Mr Rossli. What happened next? Mr Rossli said he would give half the money to causes that helped victims of violence. Two men were initially jailed for robbing him, but their convictions were subsequently overturned by a Court of Appeal judge. Robert Berry The cause? Robert Berry, 42, died while taking part in the London Marathon in 2014. He had initially set out to raise Â£1,700 for the National Osteoporosis Society, because his mother was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 52. How it caught on? Within hours of his name being confirmed by race sponsors, Mr Berry's own online donation page started to accrue thousands of donations, as links to it were shared on Twitter and Facebook. In total more than Â£77,000 was raised for the cause - almost 45 times the original target. Manchester Dogs' Home The cause? More than Â£2m was raised for Manchester Dogs' Home after it was destroyed by a fire on 11 September 2014. More than 150 dogs were rescued from the blaze, but some 60 animals died. How it caught on? People took to Twitter to post photos of themselves with their dogs - using the hashtag #dogselfie among others - to raise awareness of the fire. Hundreds of animal lovers also arrived at the scene to bring blankets, dog food and other supplies. An official online JustGiving page raised Â£500,000 for the home in under 17 hours. What happened next? The money was used to rebuild the kennels at the home, which was established in 1893 and cares for more than 7,000 dogs each year. Two boys aged 15 and 17 were arrested on suspicion of arson, but were later released without charge. Susan Taylor The cause? Susan Taylor died aged 34 after trying to swim across the English Channel in July 2013. She initially set out to raise money for both Diabetes UK and Rainbows Hospice in Loughborough. How it caught on? Ms Taylor's campaign was picked up on social media and interest in it spread as her death was widely reported in the national press. Her story compelled thousands of people to leave a donation and, to date, more than Â£100,000 has been given to the charities. What happened next? Ms Taylor's family and the charities thanked the public for their generosity. However the family also said they had been left ""disappointed and upset"" after a Â£300,000 donation left in her memory proved to be a hoax. Alan Barnes The cause? Alan, 67, broke his collarbone when he was pushed to the ground and mugged outside his Tyneside home on 25 January. Following the incident, Katie Cutler set up a donation page on the website gofundme.com, with the aim of raising Â£500 for the pensioner. How it caught on? As news of Alan's attack spread and was reported in the press, Ms Cutler's target was quickly surpassed. By 19:00 GMT on 31 January, it had reached Â£165,644. By midday on Monday 2 February, it stood at almost Â£300,000 - with more than 22,500 people donating. What's next? Alan has vowed to put the money ""to good use"" and is receiving financial advice.","The plight of disabled pensioner Alan Barnes, who was mugged outside his Tyneside home, has led to almost Â£300,000 being raised in his name."
"By Nelli BirdBBC News It was launched in 2005 after the death of an 84-year-old woman, and involved 75 police officers over seven years. Prana Das never faced trial after sustaining serious brain damage in a burglary at his home in 2012. Wayne David said his death in January raised questions about what should happen next. After the attack, a judge ruled that charges Dr Das faced following the Â£11.6m inquiry should be left on file, and the case did not proceed. It was also agreed at the same time that the chief executive of the company owning the care homes, Paul Black, should not face trial alone - and charges against him were also left on file. Dr Das owned two of the homes which were investigated as part of the inquiry, and once owned 25 care homes in south Wales. The police investigation, known as Operation Jasmine, was launched after the death of Gladys Thomas. Mrs Thomas, a patient at Bryngwyn Mountleigh nursing home in Newbridge, was admitted to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital after being given incorrect doses of medication. She later died. Pressure sores A nurse at the home admitted neglect on the basis of not administering the correct medication. Eight carers and nurses were charged with wilful neglect relating to injuries on her body but the prosecution dropped the case three weeks into the trial in 2008. More than 100 potential victims were identified as part of the inquiry and police took more than 4,000 statements. One woman was found to have developed pressure sores that exposed her bones. A review in 2015 criticised the decision not to continue the prosecution of Dr Das. ""It's important to recognise that the case wasn't closed, it was simply left open,"" argued Mr David, the Labour MP for Caerphilly. ""Now Dr Das has passed away, I think an assessment has to made whether or not it's possible to continue with a trial against one of the defendants, Mr Black. ""I'm not a legal person, I haven't seen all the evidence and I don't know how strong the cases are. ""But it's important, I think, for us to have closure as far as possible by having a proper review of the evidence which is available so a decision can be taken whether to proceed with a trial or not."" Charges were brought against Puretruce Healthcare Ltd, Dr Das - who was one of the company's directors - and its chief executive Mr Black in relation to the care received by people living at Brithdir Nursing Home in New Tredegar. They were brought as a result of Operation Jasmine which saw Gwent Police investigate six care homes in south Wales, identifying 100 alleged victims. In September 2019, inquests were opened into the deaths of four people who were cared for at care homes run by Dr Das. Pre-inquest hearings took place into the deaths of Dorothea Hale, Evelyn Jones, Stanley Bradford and Edith Evans. They died at two homes - Ms Hale at Bargoed's Grosvenor Nursing Home and the others at Brithdir. 'Open trial' ""It must be extremely difficult for the families,"" added the Caerphilly MP. ""There's a proper assessment through the coroner's process taking place at the moment but I think all the families would like closure of this whole business and the best way to do that is to have an open trial and there has to a very good reason why a trial may not take place. ""Personally I think that would be the best way forward and justice would be seen to be done."" Gwent Police and the Health and Safety Executive, which led the investigation into allegations of neglect, said proceedings were ""unlikely to recommence"". ""Although the charges remain on file and under review, with the passage of time, the focus is now in the coronial process,"" said an official. ""[The coroner] is of the opinion that although charges are on file and subject of judicial proceedings, in the absence of a trial and considering the public interest, relevant information will be disclosed for the coronial proceedings."" Operation Jasmine","Evidence in Wales' biggest inquiry into alleged care home neglect should be reviewed following the death of the man at the centre of it, an MP says."
"By Angus CrawfordBBC News The operators sell fuel which has been smuggled or is substandard after being mixed with cheaper chemicals. They do not pay tax and cost the Exchequer hundreds of millions of pounds a year in what petrol retailers are saying is a ""crimewave"". HMRC says its detection is improving and the illegal trade is reducing. Figures from HMRC show that in the 2012-13 period it made 6,506 visits to sites in the UK. It detected illicit fuel, mostly diesel, being sold on 388 occasions, compared with 262 detections in 2009-10. Pat Curtis, of HMRC's specialist investigations unit, believes criminal gangs are feeding off the recession. ""Criminal gangs will take advantage of any tax differential to make money on it,"" he says. ""They'll take advantage of customers out there who may be feeling the pinch and may be feeling they're getting value for money."" Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers' Association (PRA), describes the pop-up garages as a ""crimewave"" engulfing the market. ""A stagnant economy gives rise to unemployment, especially for younger people, and lowers real wages,"" he says. ""The inevitable result is that criminal activity becomes an alternative despite the risks."" Tax losses The fuel being sold is often substandard and can seriously damage car engines. The chemicals used by the gangs and the waste they produce also damage the environment. No-one knows exactly how much excise fraud costs the government. The most recent estimates by HMRC are from 2010-11, which calculate that the loss to the Exchequer could be anything between Â£150m to Â£700m. HMRC insist that the trend is downwards, reflecting the success of its strategy to prevent fuel fraud. But Edmund King, president of the AA, says anecdotal evidence suggests the opposite. ""We believe that the sales of illicit fuel are on the increase broadly linked to the increase in fuel prices and slump in the economy over the last four to five years,"" he says. ""Geographically it has spread from Northern Ireland, to the north of England and now down to the south east."" That view appears to be backed up by HMRC's own figures. Testing improvements In 2009-10, officers detected illegal fuel sales on 150 occasions in Northern Ireland and 112 in the rest of the UK. Last year, there were 128 in Northern Ireland and 260 in the rest of the UK. Brian Madderson, from the PRA, applauds the work HMRC has done in Northern Ireland, but argues it has to change focus. ""It is now time for them to focus their efforts on Great Britain,"" he says. ""Independent services stations continue to close at the rate of 175 to 200 each year, mostly in challenged rural areas, with loss of jobs and local facilities."" But Mr Curtis suggests the reported rise in sales in England, Scotland and Wales may be down to better testing. ""We were under no illusions that it was happening everywhere,"" he says. 'Affects everybody' So just how easy is it to buy illegal fuel? Our contacts led us to a warehouse on a trading estate in east London. We asked if they sold ""cheap diesel"" and were offered fuel for Â£1.15 per litre - approximately 25p less than at the pumps. The operator pumped 40 litres into the tank, we paid in cash and were given no receipt. HMRC says all these are indicators of illicit fuel sales. When we had the fuel siphoned from the car and tested, it was contaminated and substandard. Mr Curtis says the criminals who sell, and the motorists who buy, are depriving the government of much-needed funds. ""The loss of this revenue affects how government works,"" he says. ""It affects everybody in their pocket.""","There has been a 48% increase in the detection of illegal fuel sales from so called ""pop-up garages"" in the UK, HM Revenue and Customs figures show."
"Firefighters are examining the hole after staff and customers were asked to leave Sainsbury's in Ripon when the ground gave way in an alley behind the building. Police and engineers were also called to the scene but there were no reports of injuries. The North Yorkshire city is known for the phenomenon of sinkholes in recent years. Yorkshire breaking news: Ram-raiders hit designer store for third time; Yorkshire chippy charms Chinese tourists North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said on Twitter on Tuesday: ""Police and Fire and local authority Emergency Planning all currently investigating a report of a possible sinkhole opening in Ripon. Police said they were called to the store at 10:00 BST. 'Maze-like caves' In 2016, a 74-year-old woman described her lucky escape after she almost fell into a 30ft (9m) deep sinkhole which appeared in her back garden in Magdelen's Road. In November 2016, seven properties were evacuated in Magdalen's Road when a 49ft (15m) by (49ft) 15m hole opened up behind a terrace of houses. Two years earlier, 400 yards away in Magdalen's Close, a house had to be demolished after a sinkhole formed. After the 2014 event, the British Geological Survey (BGS) said gypsum under the town had dissolved to form a maze-like cave system. It said in a report that sinkholes appeared in Ripon every two or three years in the 1980s and 1990s but there had not been any reported in the seven years before the 2014 event. The BGS said there were a number of possible triggering mechanisms, relating to action of water underground.",A supermarket has been evacuated after a sinkhole opened up behind it.
"All 10 authorities must endorse the Greater Manchester Spatial Framework (GMSF) for it to proceed. However, Stockport Council, which is in no overall control, looks set to reject it due a row over green belt land. Talks between Tory councillors and Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) failed to reach a compromise. GMCA said if GMSF was not endorsed, each council would have to decide its own development plans and would be obliged to meet government house-building requirements in their borough. The plan spread the requirements across the city region's 10 boroughs, allowing some councils to have to less development than required. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said hopes that the Conservative minority in Stockport would back an offer to remove plans for hundreds of green belt homes in the borough were dashed when the group rejected the move. A GMCA spokesman said local authorities withdrawing from the GMSF ""will be required to build their full government housing allocation"" and Stockport's green belt would be under greater pressure outside GMSF. Conservative councillor Mile Hurleston said his colleagues were ""not against joint planning, but are against the allocation of green belt for housing in Stockport"". On Wednesday, Oldham followed Salford, Trafford, Bury and Rochdale in postponing a vote on the development masterplan. Stockport is expected to vote it down on 3 December.

"Mark D'ArcyParliamentary correspondent And these could be very big events, given the growing tensions over the government's strategy. But here are five things to watch out for next week: Not an easy trick but possible, depending on what (if any) new Covid regulations might be put to MPs. But suddenly, it feels like these relatively new creations have taken on a real political life of their own. Perhaps I can ask a heretical question - who cares? Regret motions have no effect so they're a kind of parliamentary pout. While it wouldn't surprise me if peers passed one of them, the real action on the UKIMB will come when they start voting on amendments at report stage a couple of weeks down the road. This could be the biggest example yet of the influence of hashtagged social media campaigns on what is debated in Parliament and, by extension, on government policy. It's also an interesting week for the balance of power between MPs and Peers. Their lordships have spent many happy evenings rewriting government legislation, and the Commons keeps bouncing the bills back to them with their amendments struck out. This week, peers will decide whether to stick or twist on the Agriculture Bill on Tuesday and the Immigration and Social Security Coordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill on Wednesday. Will they remain defiant and send back some marginally watered-down version of their changes and ask MPs to think again? Or will they mutter to themselves, ""well, we've tried"", and accept the decision of the Commons? The decisions should supply some useful context for the changes they're likely to make to the UKIMB. Anyway, here's my rundown of the week ahead: Monday 19 October The Commons week begins at 14:30 with an hour of work and pensions questions, after which any post-weekend statements or urgent questions will follow. There is plenty of space for, for example, a big Covid-19 statement. The main business is consideration of Lords amendments to the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill. The government was defeated on no less than seven amendments in the Upper House. The key one was Lord Dubs' amendment to ensure that rights under UK law to family reunion - currently covered by the Dublin III Treaty EU regulations - will continue after the transition period. In Westminster Hall, MPs will debate petitions on pet theft, which call for it to be made a specific offence, distinct from theft of inanimate objects. They argue that, in sentencing, the courts must consider the ""fear, alarm or distress to the pet and owners and not monetary value"". That's followed by a debate on e-petition 321862 on immigration, which calls for the rapid removal of illegal immigrants - this one could be quite lively. On the committee corridor, Public Accounts discusses money - no change there. But this is a more literal session at 14:30 on the production and distribution of cash, with witnesses including the chief cashier of the Bank of England and the CEO of the Royal Mint. In the Lords, the day begins at 13:00 with the introduction of Lord Dodds of Duncairn - the DUP's former Westminster leader Nigel Dodds, who lost his seat at the general election. Questions to ministers cover the future of historic statues in England, the cost of the government's decision to appeal the High Court ruling that charging Â£1,000 for children to register as British citizens was unlawful, and the review of the Gender Recognition Act. The main event is the second reading debate on the United Kingdom Internal Market Bill, which gives the government powers to break its commitments under the EU Withdrawal Agreement, and therefore break international law in a ""limited and specific way"". This is where we will see those regret motions I mentioned, from the convenor of the crossbenchers, and former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, and from the Tory grandee, Lord Cormack. Bring popcorn, and maybe sandwiches - with 91 speakers already listed, the debate will spill over into Tuesday. Tuesday 20 October MPs open at 11:30 with Treasury questions. The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Stella Creasy would give employees the right to information about the pay given to people doing the same or a similar job - arguing you can't know if you're being discriminated against without that information. MPs then polish off the Non-Domestic Rating (Lists) (No. 2) Bill, which postpones the next business rates revaluation until April 2023, before moving to a general debate on Black History Month. This is about as uncontroversial as legislation gets. In Westminster Hall at 09:30, there's a debate on support for children and families during the Covid-19 outbreak. While on the committee corridor, Health and Social Care takes evidence on workforce burnout and resilience in the NHS and social care In the Lords at 12:00, ministers field questions on helping armed forces personnel from Commonwealth countries to settle in the UK and the new cancer task-force. There will also be a debut question from the long-serving former arts minister, Lord Vaizey of Didcot, on and the financial impact on the retail and tourism sector of the decision to withdraw the VAT retail export scheme. That is followed by further debate on the UK Internal Market Bill - including the winding speeches. Then peers debate the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) (Amendment) (No. 5) Regulations 2020 (1029) - an iteration of the regulations limiting the size of gatherings in various venues, amended several times during the crisis, with the latest being the introduction of the 22:00 closing time. Peers will also be considering ""Commons reasons"" for rejecting the amendments they had made to the Agriculture Bill. New amendments are being put up by two of the key voices in their earlier debates - Labour's Lord Grantchester and the crossbencher and former NFU stalwart, Lord Curry of Kirkharle - so there may be a further round of ""ping pong"" with MPs. Wednesday 21 October The Commons opens at 11:30 with half an hour of women and equalities questions, followed by Prime Minister's Question Time The day's Ten Minute Rule Bill, from new-intake Conservative Andrew Griffith, is on Vehicle Registration Offences (Penalty Points). He wants to tackle anti-social drivers of expensive high performance machines, especially in less policed rural areas, who defy speed limits and number plate recognition cameras by using number plates with small or non-standard fonts that cannot be read from a distance or by cameras. Mr Griffith's bill would make number plate offences under the Vehicle Excise and Registration Act 1994 endorsable and consequently subject to penalty points on the recipient's driving license. That's followed by two Labour opposition day debates on ""fire and re-hire"" and social care. On the committee corridor, Home Affairs quizzes a series of police witnesses at 09:45 about Home Office preparedness for Covid-19, while the Treasury Committee hears from two panels of economic experts at 14:30 on the economic impact of coronavirus. In the Lords at 12:00, ministers face questions on the review of rail schemes in Network Rail's enhancements pipeline and whether High Speed 2 faces a similar review. There will also be questions on the impact on prisons and prisoners of increasing the maximum period of remand in custody by eight weeks and agreement on visa-free short-term travel in the Brexit negotiations. Then peers will consider some orders and regulations, starting with Pension Protection Fund (Moratorium and Arrangements and Reconstructions for Companies in Financial Difficulty) (Amendment) Regulations 2020, which deals with the rights of pensions scheme members when companies seek a moratorium to give them respite from their creditors. This is followed by the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Bill votes on the Commons reasons - another round of parliamentary ping pong - with debate expected to focus on child refugees (the Dubs amendment), EU settled status and the right of return. Thursday 22 October MPs begin at 09:30 with transport questions, followed by the weekly business statement from the Leader of the House - setting out the agenda for the Commons for the week after their half-term break. The main event is a general debate on Covid-19. These are now a regular fixture, and another has been pencilled in for 3 November - the first day back after the break. In Westminster Hall at 13:30, there is a debate on the transparency of the Integrated Activity Fund - the Â£1.2bn a year Foreign Office aid programme intended to support global security and peace building in conflict zones. Human rights campaign group Reprieve says it has funded the training of prison officers and others complicit in abuses in Bahrain. That is followed at 15:00 by a debate on the Ministry of Justice legal aid budget, led by Justice Committee chair Sir Bob Neill. On the committee corridor at 10:30, Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy continues its ""levelling up"" inquiry, with evidence from metro-mayors, including Greater Manchester's Andy Burnham, Liverpool City region's Steve Rotheram, North of Tyne's Jamie Driscoll and West of England's Tim Bowles. The focus will be on their powers to attract investment and promote economic growth, but it will also look at the impact Covid-19 might have on the government's levelling up agenda. In the Lords at 12:00, there are questions on the role of alms-houses in housing the elderly, the impact of the pandemic on the gig economy, and the legacy of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Then peers debate a series of local anti-Coronavirus regulations, covering restrictions on household mixing in private dwellings and gardens in Leeds, Wigan, Stockport and Blackpool, and restrictions on households and businesses in Gateshead, Newcastle, Northumberland, North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Sunderland. Friday 23 October It's another Private Members Bill day in the Commons from 09:30. They're coming thick and fast at the moment because of rescheduling due to the pandemic. But, as ever, it's unlikely that more than the first three bills will be debated - so while there might be some interest in some of the measures lurking further down the agenda, they're unlikely to be considered before time runs out. First up is the second reading of the Animal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill from the Conservative MP Chris Loder. This would increase the maximum penalty for cruelty offences from six months to up to five years. He argues that more stringent sentencing will act as a greater deterrent against animal cruelty. Sir Christopher Chope's Mobile Homes Act 1983 (Amendment) Bill and his Caravan Sites Bill will also come up. After that, MPs take a half-term break, returning on 3 November - but the Lords can carry on legislating through the final week of October.",The government has already flagged up that the coming week's programme could well be re-jigged at short notice to allow for debates on Covid-19 regulations or other pandemic developments
"Sally Challen, 65, was found guilty of murdering 61-year-old Richard in a hammer attack in August 2010 and jailed for life in 2011. The conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal in February. Appearing at the Old Bailey via video-link earlier, Mrs Challen, of Claygate in Surrey, denied murder. Mrs Challen wept in court as Mr Justice Edis granted bail and several hours later was released from HMP Bronzefield, Surrey. The judge set a further hearing for 7 June and a trial date for 1 July ""if necessary"". The appeal followed a campaign by her sons David, 31, and James, 35. Speaking outside court earlier, David said the family was looking forward to ""being together again after so long"". He said: ""We are overjoyed that bail has been granted for our mother and she will be now released back to us. Our mother now rejoins our family."" Mrs Challen's brother Chris Jenney added: ""The family are all supporting Sally. We have done from day one. Our strength's built and will build even further."" During the two-day appeal hearing in February, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. The murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. Lawyers for Mrs Challen, who has never denied killing her husband, asked for the murder conviction to be substituted to manslaughter but the panel of judges refused and ordered a retrial. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice after the conviction was quashed, David said: ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account.""",A woman whose sons campaigned against her conviction for murdering her husband has been released from prison ahead of a fresh trial.
"By Vincent KearneyBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent Chief Constable George Hamilton has already made it clear that the police believe the Provisional IRA still exists, and that some of its members were involved in the murder of Kevin McGuigan in east Belfast in August. Mr Hamilton has also said: Unless there have been dramatic developments in recent weeks, the paramilitary assessment to be published by Northern Ireland Secretary of State Theresa Villiers on Tuesday will mirror those views. What the Chief Constable has not said is whether the IRA's ruling army council remains intact. I asked Mr Hamilton that question on 22 August, just minutes after his press conference at PSNI headquarters when he said members of the IRA killed Kevin McGuigan. ""I don't want to get into the detail of that,"" he replied. ""What I am happy to say is that, at an operational level, we do not see the infrastructure that existed in the 1990s - people are not targeting, there is no procurement of weapons, there is no intention to murder people for political purposes. ""Our assessment is that the hierarchy of the organisation, so that it can be co-ordinated, controlled, and that members can be influenced, still exists. ""There's a number of names given to different tiers of that hierarchy, and I am not going to start speculating,"" Mr Hamilton added. 'Political alternative' Ass Ch Con Will Kerr, the officer who leads the PSNI's efforts to combat paramilitary activity, has also refused to be drawn on the issue. Last month, he told a public meeting of the policing board that the IRA's operational tier, its so-called Active Service Units, no longer exist. But when asked a direct question about whether the IRA army council is still in place, he declined to comment, saying he did not want to talk about ""labels"". Given that the aim of this assessment is to provide an analysis of the current structure of the Provisional IRA, it seems reasonable to expect it to answer this question. If it says there is an army council, the focus will be on what it says about its role and purpose. Mr Hamilton has suggested that retaining some level of control may have been necessary for the IRA to ensure its members supported a political alternative to violence. ""There is a mechanism, perhaps to bring people along this path of the peace process, to pursue a peaceful political republican agenda without recourse to violence,"" he told me in August. 'Prevent defections' The chief constable has said its role and purpose today is ""radically"" different to the period of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, when it directed a campaign of violence. Some security sources have also said the continued existence of a Provisional IRA structure may have helped prevent defections of former members to the ranks of dissident republican organisations. The chief constable has publicly managed to avoid answering direct questions about the current status of the IRA army council. It is unlikely he managed to avoid answering similar questions from the paramilitary assessment panel appointed by the secretary of state. The question now is, will Ms Villiers reveal the answer in her statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday afternoon?","Sinn FÃ©in insists that the Provisional IRA has gone away and no longer exists, but the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) takes a very different view."
"Medics treated 560 patients who had been critically injured by knives or guns - nearly a third of the total callouts last year. It is the first time in the charity's history the category exceeded the number of collisions, totalling 533. It comes in a year which saw 80 fatal stabbings in London. Dr Gareth Grier, lead clinician at London's Air Ambulance, said: ""It is not unusual now for our teams to perform open chest surgery for stab wounds twice in a single day. ""This would have been unheard of a few years back. But our world-leading treatments mean that we can give these and other patients we treat the best possible chance of survival."" Victims of stabbings and shootings accounted for 31% of the charity's work in 2017. There were an extra 60 such cases compared with the 500 in 2016 while road collisions fell from 606 to 533. The busiest boroughs for the charity were Hackney, Newham and Westminster, while more than 400 of its cases involved falls from height. Since its inception in 1989, London's Air Ambulance has treated more than 37,000 patients and attended the majority of major incidents in London, which in 2017 has included the Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire. The 24/7 service for London costs Â£10m per year, which is mostly funded through charitable donations.","London's Air Ambulance attended more stabbings and shootings than traffic accidents in 2017, it has been revealed."
"Radek Kotlarek, 39, from Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy, was arrested on Sunday after driving more than 20 miles to Talacre, Flintshire, with his wife and son. Mr Kotlarek was released without charge and has not been fined for breaching Covid regulations. North Wales Police said the officers behaved in a ""calm and reasonable way"". Now posts from September and January on Mr Kotlarek's Facebook page have emerged in which he appeared to claim coronavirus was ""fake"". North Wales Police said officers arrested Mr Kotlarek after he refused to give his name when they suspected he had breached coronavirus regulations. Mr Kotlarek said he took his wife, Marta, and teenage son to the beauty spot - which is about 22 miles (35km) from their home - for a ""mental break"", with concerns their son was struggling in lockdown and because of the ""trauma"" of missing seriously ill family members in Poland. In a video posted on social media the couple are heard telling the officers their trip was essential. Mr Kotlarek is heard shouting ""stop it"" at the officers before one responds by saying: ""Stop shouting at me or I will arrest you."" He is then handcuffed after telling the officer: ""You are harassing us."" Ch Supt Nigel Harrison of North Wales Police said: ""The person was spoken to at Talacre beach as officers reasonably suspected he had committed an offence, which in this case was a breach in coronavirus regulations. ""The man, who is from the seaside town of Rhos-on-Sea, some 22 miles away, was arrested because his details could not be ascertained at the time in order to be reported for the suspected breach."" Wales' lockdown rules state all exercise must start from home and travel must only be for essential reasons. Coronavirus legislation states it is an offence to contravene an instruction given by an enforcement officer. Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Mr Kotlarek insisted he was not a ""Covid-denier"", despite the posts made on his Facebook account. The public relations worker said government measures to tackle the infection were ""disproportionate"" and the ""media narrative over-exaggerated"". He said: ""It's not like I am against the vaccines, they're great, but people should be given a free will whether they want to accept it or not."" He also strongly denied he had planned the confrontation with the police. After being arrested and taken to custody in St Asaph, Mr Kotlarek claimed he was told he would be released if he gave his name, but refused to do as he believed he had not committed a crime. ""They took me to an interrogation room and said if I didn't give my name they would strip-search me,"" he said. Allegations that Mr Kotlarek was strip-searched while in custody were put to the force, but it did not respond. 'Calm and reasonable' It was only when an officer went for scissors to cut his clothes off that Mr Kotlarek claimed he voluntarily undressed and put on a paper suit he had been supplied with. He said the incident followed recent family problems, with his wife's brother seriously ill in Poland, as well as other relatives dying. Mr Kotlarek was released after about three hours in custody and said he was considering bringing a formal complaint against North Wales Police. Ch Supt Harrison added: ""The officers behaved in a calm and reasonable way as I would have expected. ""As is always the case, if the individual wishes to query or complain about the way they were treated then of course we will review the full circumstances.""",A man who was arrested after police suspected he had breached Covid rules by going to the beach has claimed he was strip-searched while in custody.
"John Jr Phillips, 28, told Cardiff Crown Court he regularly went to Anthony Winter's flat over three years. Mr Winter, 32, was found beaten and stabbed in woods at St Mellons in Cardiff in November 2018. The defendant, from Newport, along with a girl and boy - both 17 - all deny murder, while 19-year-old Christopher James Jones admits murder with a knife. The prosecution has claimed Mr Winter was lured to a flat in Newport and ""viciously assaulted and tortured"" for several hours by a group before being stabbed after failing to access his bank account. But during his defence, Mr Phillips said the victim was involved in a fight with the 17-year-old boy, but did not owe any drugs money, which has been claimed by the prosecution. He then added Mr Winter went to clean himself up but came back still bleeding and making more mess. ""We started arguing,"" the defendant said. ""I shouted at him. I punched him to the face - I think his mouth and his nose - he fell backwards onto his back on the floor."" Mr Phillips told the jury the 17-year-old boy then stood over Mr Winter, repeatedly punching him to ribs. He said he told the others to leave and he would call a taxi. The court previously heard Mr Winter was taken by taxi to St Mellons at about 06:15 GMT on 22 November and was stabbed in woods by Jones in his thigh, passing through an artery and ""left to die."" Asked if there was any plan to injure or kill Mr Winters, Mr Phillips replied: ""Not at all, everyone was going home,"" adding he had no knowledge of any phone calls to the victim's bank to try to get money transferred. The trial continues.",A man accused of murdering a drug addict has said he used to smoke crack cocaine with the victim.
"About 100 military personnel will aid Birmingham City Council with its ""drop and collect"" testing programme. At a weekly briefing, the council's deputy leader said it would assist civilian efforts to maximise the numbers of tests able to be done. It comes as the number of cases in the city reached 107.6 per 100,000 people - the highest in the West Midlands. The ""drop and collect service"" sees tests dropped off at a resident's door and then collected by staff and is aimed at areas with high rates of infection, to provide a service to people who can't leave their homes and to encourage those who may not be proactive in getting tested. ""We have been in talks with the military about them giving us some extra capacity for drop-and-collect,"" deputy leader, councillor Brigid Jones told a meeting of the West Midlands Combined Authority on Friday. She said their assistance would be ""very much in an extra capacity, feet-on-the-ground sense"" and 500 council staff had also been redeployed to the ""drop-and-collect"" testing service. Ms Jones said that there are 30 wards in the city with more than 20 cases and Sparkhill has seen 70 cases in the last seven days and although testing has increased dramatically, the rate of positive cases to tests has also increased to 6.7%. ""Our plea to residents would be, if one of our staff knocks on your door, please take up the opportunity to take a test,"" Ms Jones added.

"The county's Strategic Market Housing Assessment (SMHA) echoes a long-standing issue among the six local authorities to build more homes. Some councils say they will now revise their housing strategy, while others say the report does not reflect the problem of finding space to build on. A more detailed study will be published in the coming weeks. 'Limited building locations' The report has identified a greater housing need than some of the councils had allowed for in their local plans. Councillor Warwick Robinson, of West Oxfordshire District Council, said it was ""an important part of the evidence base"" for its Local Plan, but did ""not take into account limitations on development"" from ""environmental constraints or issues related to congestion and local infrastructure"". While Councillor Mike Murray, of Vale of White Horse District Council, said: ""We need a new Local Plan in place as soon as we can. This housing market assessment has provided us with the up-to-date evidence we need to help us achieve that."" South Oxfordshire District Council said it would ""canvass local opinion"" before making any housing number decisions. Cherwell District Council said the report proposed ""additional growth"" for the area and that it would commission an additional assessment before dealing with building extra housing ""over the next 20 years in a very limited number of locations"". The SMHA is a technical study intended to help the Oxfordshire local planning authorities understand how many homes will be needed in the period 2011 to 2031.","At least 106,500 homes are needed across Oxfordshire by 2031, a report has recommended."
"The Cube, which must find Â£185,000 before 31 December when its leasehold expires, intends to auction the print. The work comes from the ""Di-faced tenner"" series - a set of spoof Â£10 notes replacing the Queen's head with an image of the late Princess of Wales. The signed and authenticated framed print was one of 50 produced. 'Independent art scene' It will be valued later in the week, a Cube spokesman said. One was sold at auction for Â£24,000 in 2007. ""We have one of only 50 signed prints in existence that feature multiple 'uncut' notes with both sides visible,"" he added. Once the freehold is bought, the Cube added, they would continue improvements to the building. ""This means we'll be continuing our fundraising activities. All proceeds from the 'Di-faced tenners' auction will go towards this ongoing goal, which is appropriate, as it's rumoured that Banksy frequented the Cube in his pre-fame days,"" he said. The Cube is run by about 150 voluntary staff who have been renting the building since 1998. The venue, which stages left-field film showings and performance art, is funded with income from the bar and the door. Its 15-year lease expires at the end of the year and volunteers said they ""jumped at the chance"" when the landlord offered to sell them the building - if they could raise the funds in time. Their supporters include Arts Council England who have pledged Â£90,000, and other established venues in the city have also helped. A recent benefit gig at the Bristol Old Vic raised Â£5,000 and the Cube's neighbour ArtSpace LifeSpace ""chipped in Â£1,000"". The rest of the money raised has come from the ""generosity of the public"". Cube volunteer David Hopkinson said: ""It's very exciting to have the piece donated. ""Obviously the nature of anonymity means we don't know who it's from. ""But it's fitting as both Banksy and the Cube emerged on the Bristol independent art scene at the same time and artwork to do with money often sells particularly well in auction.""",A rare Banksy artwork has been donated anonymously to an independently-run arts venue in Bristol which is campaigning to buy its building.
"Carlos Velez, 20, suspected David Martinez had kissed his girlfriend before the attack at their Leytonstone flat, east London, on 6 March 2019. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC told jurors Mr Martinez, 26, was killed ""for no good reason at all"". Mr Velez, who had denied the murder, will be sentenced on Friday. The Old Bailey heard how Velez had a history of violently-possessive behaviour, having punched a stranger on the Tube for looking at his girlfriend Ashlly Rondon-Diaz. On the day of the killing, Mr Martinez texted a cousin that Velez was acting ""all crazy and was asking if [he] had kissed his girlfriend."" In another message, he wrote: ""I am going to try to go on Friday else I'll end up dead."" Ms Rondon-Diaz walked in on Velez attacking Mr Martinez in the kitchen after hearing screams, jurors heard. Mr Martinez suffered multiple knife wounds to his head, shoulder, chest and thigh as well as defensive cuts to his hands, the court heard. He ran out of the flat but collapsed and died on the pavement. Velez fled to Portsmouth, where he changed his clothes, but was later arrested. He told police he was getting ""visions of things"" and claimed to be hearing voices. But Mr Brown said Velez ""was responsible for the murder of Mr Martinez in a jealous explosion of violence in the home that he had been sharing with the victim and the defendant's girlfriend"". ""Using a knife to slash and to stab a completely innocent man and to take his life, all because he was accused of looking at this defendant's girlfriend and accused of kissing her,"" he added. 'Hearing voices' Devi Kharran, of the CPS, said: ""The prosecution case against Carlos Velez included strong witness testimony and forensic evidence, which was able to convince the jury of his guilt. ""When interviewed by police Velez changed his story numerous times. First he claimed that he himself had been robbed of his phone at knife-point and had no knowledge of the murder. ""Then he went on to say he could not remember what had happened. Later he claimed to be having visions and hearing voices. At one point he even sought to blame the killing on his girlfriend. ""Velez will now spend a significant time in jail as a result of his actions.""","A possessive boyfriend has been found guilty of stabbing his flatmate to death in a ""jealous explosion of violence""."
"Simon Blevins, Richard Roberts and Rich Loizou were sentenced in September for climbing on lorries at energy firm Cuadrilla's Preston New Road site. About 200 people marched from Preston railway station to HMP Preston in support of the men. Solicitors confirmed on Friday the men would be appealing their sentences. The marching crowd chanted ""free the three"" and stopped traffic as they made their way to the prison, where they sang songs and banged drums. Blevins, from Sheffield, and Roberts, from London, were jailed for 16 months, while Loizou, from Devon, received 15 months in prison. Loizou's parents, Sharron and Platon, were among those marching in protest to the sentences. Mrs Loizou said the support was ""helping"" her son, who she said would ""never hurt anybody [and] just cares about the planet"". Her husband added the couple were ""very sad"" about what had happened and had ""never believed it would come to a prison sentence"". The march's organiser Leigh Coghill said the men were ""buoyed and entirely grateful for the support that they have received"". ""I spoke to one of them this morning and he said the support has been like a blanket round the prison that made him feel safe,"" he added. Others on the march included Isabelle Luterbacher and Tina Lynham, who travelled from Devon to support the ""enthusiastic, energetic and inspirational"" Loizou, and Miranda Cox, a town councillor in nearby Kirkham, who described the men's sentences as ""draconian and unprecedented"". The protest came a day after Cuadrilla announced it would begin fracking at its site next week. That announcement was followed by the granting of a temporary injunction, halting the start of work until a legal challenge is heard at the High Court on Wednesday.",Supporters of three men jailed following an anti-fracking protest have been demonstrating outside the prison where they are being held.
"South Shields Metro station, which opened in 1984, is shutting to make way for the town's new Â£21m bus and Metro interchange. Owner Nexus said it was the first permanent station closure since the network opened. The station, on King Street, has been used by 50 million passengers, including Great North runners. The new Interchange opens less than 100m away in Keppel Street on 4 August. Huw Lewis, customer services director at Nexus, said: ""We've never closed a station before, and I am sure many people have memories of the old South Shields - it's been part of everyday life for so long for the daily commute, trips to the seaside. ""In some ways it's sad to say goodbye, but the difference in quality will be obvious as Metro moves across the road."" The new building will also have a cafÃ©, bike storage and waiting areas. Construction of the interchange is part of phase two of the Â£100m South Shields 365 regeneration plan, which began in April 2018.

"Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said the Â£300,000 scheme would cover sites in Guildford, Staines, Salfords and Woking. The team will assess all detainees and aim to identify people who need treatment and support, the NHS said. Team leader Matt Lamport said: ""It's important to remember that not everyone in custody is a criminal."" Mr Lamport said people could be held for interview by police but also if they were detained under the Mental Health Act. Police can detain people for 72 hours if no crime had been committed but they suspect the person is mentally unwell, he said. 'Police untrained' ""Studies have shown that those detained in police custody suites have higher levels of mental health problems than the general population,"" Mr Lamport said. ""Until now we've been reliant on the police, who are of course not trained as mental health workers, to spot where there is a need and call one of our services for an assessment."" But he added that even a trained professional could not identify a mental illness by sight alone and it was safe to assume some people would be released or moved to prison without being identified. Funding for the scheme has come from NHS England. The service will be covered by three mental health workers who will provide assessments during office hours. It is hoped the service, known as the Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service, will later include evenings and weekends, Mr Lamport said.",Mental health workers are to assess people being held at four police custody sites in Surrey.

The club wants the charges to be ruled ""illegal"" in the High Court. The police force said its boundaries were strategically determined. Mr Justice Eady will give his judgement later this year. At a hearing last week Michael Beloff QC told the judge the action was ""in the nature of a test case"" and the footballing and policing worlds hoped the ruling would provide ""powerful guidance"" on the issue.

"Save the M32 Maples claim the strip of land the protected trees are on falls outside the boundary of John Garlick's land on Lower Ashley Hill in Bristol. The group wants Bristol City Council to acknowledge it owns the land but the authority denies this is the case. Group spokesperson Anita Bennett said members would stay in the trees until the council agreed to meet with them. ""We want the council to talk to us and to look at the land registry documents we have which show the trees are on their land,"" said Ms Bennett. ""We want them to stop covering up the give-away of our trees."" A full council meeting is due to be held on Tuesday when the issue over the ownership of the trees will be discussed. The BBC has not been able to reach housing developer Mr Garlick for a comment. Originally there were five Norway maple trees on the site but two were felled as part of the redevelopment plans to build affordable housing on the site. Members of the group climbed the trees and built platforms in them overnight on Friday after buildings on the site were taken down on Thursday. ""We feared the trees would be next so we had to act,"" said Ms Bennett. ""The community support has been overwhelming,"" added Howard Ogden from the group. One of the campaigners, Kate, who is occupying one of the tree platforms, said she was ""prepared to stay"" to protect the tree from being cut down.",Campaigners have climbed up three Norway maple trees in a bid to stop them being cut down by a developer.
"The COP26 UN summit will now take place between 1 and 12 November next year. It was originally supposed to take place in November 2020. However, it had to be postponed due to the pandemic. Dozens of world leaders will attend the gathering, the most important round of talks since the global Paris Agreement to tackle climate change was secured in 2015. This year's event was due to take place at the Scottish Events Campus in Glasgow, which has been turned into a temporary hospital in response to coronavirus. 'Clean, resilient recovery' from Covid-19 COP26 President Alok Sharma said: ""While we rightly focus on fighting the immediate crisis of the coronavirus, we must not lose sight of the huge challenges of climate change."" Mr Sharma, who is also the UK government's business secretary, added: ""With the new dates for COP26 now agreed we are working with our international partners on an ambitious roadmap for global climate action between now and November 2021. ""The steps we take to rebuild our economies will have a profound impact on our societies' future sustainability, resilience and wellbeing and COP26 can be a moment where the world unites behind a clean resilient recovery. The UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said: ""If done right, the recovery from the Covid-19 crisis can steer us to a more inclusive and sustainable climate path."" This has come as no surprise to those who understand how UN climate conferences work. Since the Paris agreement, the annual gathering has been seeking to further the international commitment to limit global temperature rises. But that work doesn't just happen in the scheduled two weeks where delegates gather at cities around the world, in this case Glasgow. International diplomacy by the next host nation - the UK for COP26 - begins the moment the gavel comes down on the previous COP. Without it, there would be very little progress and with minds so heavily focused on tackling Covid-19 this other crisis - the climate one - has taken a bit of a back seat. Plus, countries will need to understand what their starting position is with economies being crushed by the pandemic. Many world leaders are talking of a ""green recovery"" and so allowing this breathing space might be beneficial to the long term climate cause. This year marks the date by which countries are expected to come forward with stronger emissions cuts to meet the goals of the deal. Plans submitted so far put the world on a pathway towards more than 3C of warming, though the Paris Agreement commits countries to curb temperatures to 1.5C or 2C above pre-industrial levels to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But with countries around the world grappling with coronavirus, and many putting citizens in lockdown, governments have prioritised the immediate global health crisis. Since the pandemic took hold, greenhouse gas emissions have dropped sharply as industry and transport have been curtailed, but experts have warned that pollution will soon bounce back without climate action.",A new date has been agreed for an international climate change summit in Glasgow.

"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The Department of Education has increased the money schools get per pupil by more than 5% in 2019-20. However, schools have had to pay a 7.4% increase in employer pension contributions since 1 April. The amount of funding per pupil for 2019-20 has just been published by the department. All schools will receive a basic Â£116 more per pupil this school year than in 2018-19. However, the department said that due to the increased cost of teachers' pensions, the money schools would get per pupil would stay at 2018-19 levels in real terms. ""The department has increased the 2019-20 aggregated schools' budget by Â£7.25m to maintain the age weighted pupil unit (AWPU) cash value at 2018-19 levels and Â£54.6m to mitigate the increase in teacher pension costs from 1 April 2019,"" it said. ""The 2019-20 AWPU cash value has been maintained at the 2018-19 level, when the additional funding to mitigate the increase in teacher pension costs is excluded."" School budgets in Northern Ireland have decreased by around 10% in recent years. That has meant that almost half of schools in Northern Ireland are in budget deficit. There have also been a number of recent warnings that school budgets are under increasing pressure with particular concerns around support for pupils with Special Educational Needs. About three-quarters of the funding a nursery or primary school gets from the department is based on the numbers of pupils it has. In post-primaries, almost 85% of the funding they get from the department is based on pupil numbers. Weighting value Primary and nursery schools will receive around Â£579m through the department's common funding scheme in 2019-20, compared to around Â£553m in 2018-19. Post-primary schools will receive a total of Â£650m in 2019-20, compared to Â£614m last year. Due to a weighting value attached to each pupil, post-primary schools receive significantly more money per child than primary schools. Last year, the cash value of the vast majority of primary and nursery school pupils under the common funding formula was Â£1,998 per pupil. However, in 2019-20 that has risen to Â£2,114 per pupil. A weighting value attached to each pupil means that primary schools will actually receive Â£2,283 per pupil. Post-primary schools will receive Â£2,172 per pupil in 2019-20 compared to just under Â£2,056 last year. However, a higher weighting value means that post-primaries will receive Â£3,649 for each pupil in years 8-12 and around Â£4,518 per sixth form pupil.",A funding rise for schools in Northern Ireland will be almost entirely spent on increased teacher pension costs.
"Mayor George Ferguson said there would have to be ""painful cuts"" which he said were ""bound to go into four figures"". He said the authority should be ""braver"" in commissioning services and not always look to the big companies when it could get them locally. Mr Ferguson said he wanted the voluntary sector to play a bigger role in the delivery of public services. ""We've got to be pretty clever about it [the saving]... it's [about] greater efficiencies,"" he told BBC Radio Bristol. 'Massive improvement' ""For example I've doubled the efficiency of our administration office accommodation which had a plan to save Â£2m a year. ""I've doubled that so by working from two major centres, rather than eight, we're going to save Â£5m a year ""That's a small saving to the Â£80m but a massive improvement... but I've got to look at all those efficiencies.

"The Right Reverend Peter Maurice said the Church Commissioners had not spent enough time before making ""a major decision of this kind"". Bishop Maurice plans to put a question about the decision to the General Synod - the Church of England's ruling body. The Church Commission said the move would give the bishop more privacy. Under the plans the Right Reverend Peter Hancock will work and worship at the palace in Wells but he will live temporarily in a former rectory in nearby Croscombe while a permanent house is found in the city. Bishop Hancock was appointed after the Right Reverend Peter Price stepped down in June. ""Living in the flat worked for the last bishop but at the end of a ministry there's always a review about where the next bishop should live,"" said Bishop Maurice. ""I want them to come and talk to us and listen to us."" On Friday Bishop Maurice and other senior members of the Diocese of Bath and Wells said they could not support the decision of the commission. ""If there is a persuasive case for the move, it has yet to be made,"" they said in a joint statement. Bishop Maurice suggested Bishop Hancock could move into the flat for three to five years allowing time for ""proper consultation"".

"Bristol City Council revealed plans for a charging zone and diesel ban in part of the centre that thousands pass through to access the M32 or the A4. But councillors to the south of the city are claiming the proposals are being rushed through without thought. They said people living on the A37 corridor are being ""penalised"". Dine Romero, the leader of Bath and North East Somerset, has said she will raise the issue with Bristol's elected mayor Marvin Rees. Temple Cloud with Cameley Parish Council chairman Tony Hooper said while the clean air zone is overdue ""people living along the A37 corridor and west of that, are going to be stymied trying to access the motorway network,"" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Scheme. ""For at least half of North East Somerset, it would appear we're going to be penalised for trying to get to the motorway network."" Drivers of non-compliant vehicles would have to pay the same amount being proposed in Bath - Â£9 a day for taxis, private-hire taxis and vans, and Â£100 a day for buses, coaches and lorries. In a UK first, the proposals would also see all diesel vehicles, except buses, taxis and emergency service vehicles, banned from parts of the city centre between 07:00 and 15:00. Mr Hooper added many villagers along the A37 are reliant on their cars - often diesel 4x4s - because the buses are inadequate or at capacity. Accessibility means most villagers in and around Temple Cloud go north to Bristol or south to Wells. He said a bus into Bath could take two-and-a-half hours, and would mean going via Bristol.

"The Palestinian man settled in Bristol after fleeing Gaza and says he is five years younger than officials believe. Judges said a ""serious relapse"" in his mental state means his life is in ""imminent danger"". Home Secretary Priti Patel said the case evokes the ""greatest sympathy"" but that she is under no obligation to change his birth date. The man restricted his intake of food and drink from March and has been in hospital since April. He applied to be a Nightingale hospital volunteer last year but was rejected as his claimed birth date did not match the one on his residence permit. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, took action in an effort to force the Home Office to change the date. No proof He has said he is currently 26 years old but the Home Office has assessed his age as 31. An immigration tribunal judge dismissed his claim in September and three Court of Appeal judges dismissed his appeal against the ruling on Wednesday. They said evidence provided did not prove that his claimed birth date was correct. The man was born in Gaza in the Occupied Palestinian territories and judges said he had been been ""severely mistreated"" by resistance movement Hamas after he refused to be a suicide bomber. He claimed asylum after arriving in the UK in 2007, was placed with a foster family and has since been given indefinite leave to remain. 'Choose life' The judges said they were concerned about the impact of their decision and Lord Justice Phillips said ""no effort"" should be spared in encouraging him to ""choose life"". The man has been accepting ""some clinically assisted nutrition and hydration"" in hospital. In July, a judge said he should be allowed to refuse nutrition and hydration.

"By Steffan MessengerBBC Wales Environment Correspondent The new technology - thought to be a world-first - removed up to 99.5% of metals which impact water quality. The electrochemical technique separated a metallic sludge from mine discharges leaving clean water behind. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) said it marked a potential ""step change"" in how the problem is handled. Metal mining in the UK peaked in the 18th and 19th centuries and though they have now all closed, their effect on the environment is still obvious. Wales has more than 1,300 abandoned metal mines, impacting more than 67 water bodies and in excess of 370 miles (600km) of river. Nine of the 10 worst affected catchments in the UK are in Wales. The innovative treatment plant has been tested on a stretch of the river Rheidol near Aberystwyth in Ceredigion. The area is popular with tourists for its scenic reservoir, steam train and red kites, but it was once home to mines producing lead and zinc which now discharge highly acidic, orange water into the river. It is thought eight tonnes of metal, including zinc, chromium and cadmium, enter the Rheidol every year, spreading out over 11 miles (18km) of river, killing fish and other wildlife. Since the 1960s the polluted water has been collected in large pools in an attempt to filter out the metals, with limited success. More recently, treating it using a combination of compost, limestone and cockle shells has been more effective. However, scaling up this technique would require much more land than is available in the narrow, steep-sided valley, so NRW asked technology companies to come up with an innovative solution. A portable treatment plant - the size of a car - is attached to a small generator. The system sucks in the dirty water discharged and uses a combination of electrolysis and ultrasound to clean it and correct its acidity. Swansea-based Power and Water is the company behind the technology. ""What we are able to do is to add a small amount of power on to an anode and cathode which slowly dissolve into the [contaminated water]. That allows for a chemical reaction where any contaminants are removed and the clean water can safely be discharged,"" said chief executive Gareth Morgan. The metallic sludge which sinks to the bottom of the tank can then also be removed safely. In future it is hoped the sludge could potentially be sold and the metals extracted and re-used. The three-month trial - which cost approximately Â£90,000 - was funded by the Welsh Government. Peter Stanley, a water and land contamination specialist at NRW, said the big advantage of the system it had trialled was that only a ""small spatial footprint"" is needed. ""When we've filtered the samples we've been getting 99.5% removal of metals, which is quite staggering,"" he said. ""I don't know how much more excited I could be in relation to the results that have been shown here - it gives us a new tool in our armour to effect treatment at metal mines, particularly those in steep, challenging environments like this."" Power and Water said it had been granted an international patent for the technology which it hopes to install at other abandoned mines following the success of this trial. ""This week alone we've had interest from consultants working in Sumatra and Australia as well as enquiries about mines in England and Scotland too,"" said Mr Morgan. ""Not only are we looking to try and create a solution that is going to have a beneficial impact on these historical metal mines within Wales itself but the potential to export outside of the country is exciting as well."" The Welsh Government said it had given a further Â£3.3m to NRW to tackle metal mine pollution.","A pilot scheme to clean rivers polluted by abandoned metal mines has delivered ""staggering"" results, environment officials have claimed."

Mr Tancock, 41, has been running the business for the past five years, but moved premises in March, just days before the first lockdown. He said he was touched by the amount of local support and wanted to help families who are struggling due to job losses. He said: ""A lot of families are going to have that hard choice of whether to buy food or getting toys for their children for Christmas. 'Give back' ""We have had a lot of support from the community in Weston, so I wanted to use the connections I've built up through the business to give back. ""Kids need that entertainment, that play.

"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter He said the executive will consider ""robust interventions"" on Thursday to try and manage the spread of the virus. ""We now once again need a united front across society to get us through this period and into better days,"" he said. The minister said he understood people were tired, but that the virus would ""not be taking any time off"". The executive is expected to decide on Thursday the timing and extent of any further restrictions to be imposed after a five-day Christmas relaxation from 23 to 27 December. Speaking at a press briefing at Stormont, Mr Swann said: ""People will look to the executive for a robust intervention and rightly so, but let's remember the power is in all our hands - we can stop the virus spreading."" On Wednesday, a further eight deaths linked to Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland, taking the Department of Health's total to 1,143. There have been 510 more positive tests, meaning there have been 59,631 cases overall. 'Please go the distance' There are 457 Covid-19 inpatients and 87 confirmed outbreaks in NI care homes. Jennifer Welsh, the chief executive of the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, urged the public to ""go the distance"". Her comments came after Antrim Area Hospital said it was under ""severe pressure"", with doctors treating patients in ambulances on Tuesday, with 17 vehicles outside the hospital at one point. ""Staff are mentally and physically exhausted because of this pandemic - this has been the most challenging year of their lives,"" said Ms Welsh. She urged the public to follow health advice and to avoid ""taking risks"". Vaccination plans Mr Swann revealed that about 5,300 people in Northern Ireland had received their first vaccination by Tuesday evening. He said this extended to residents in over 90 care homes so far. Joanna Sloan, a senior nurse who last week became the first person in Northern Ireland to be vaccinated, also addressed the briefing. She urged the public to show patience and to give health care staff time to roll out the vaccine. Ms Sloan said hospitals were expecting a ""significant spike"" in cases in the coming weeks. ""We are looking at a very, very difficult January,"" she said. ""We are making extreme plans for what is ahead in January and thereafter."" Meanwhile, stronger guidance has been issued by London and the devolved governments about how people should celebrate Christmas this year. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill spoke to leaders from the other governments earlier. She said people needed to take ""personal responsibility"". There was a need to ensure people were not left alone at Christmas, she added. ""The decision to allow people to come together is a recognition that Christmas is such an important part of the year, but we do have to give very strong guidance,"" Mrs Foster said. ""Isolation and loneliness are huge issues, we have to balance that against keeping people safe."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""A smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas"". He also urged caution over seeing elderly or vulnerable relatives. The temporary rules, which allow three households to meet indoors in a Christmas ""bubble"", and at places of worship or an outdoor public space, apply from 23 to 27 December. Northern Ireland has a window from 22 to 28 December to allow time for people to travel. When the changes were agreed in late-November, Mrs Foster said she hoped the announcement would give people space to plan over the holiday period. 'Taking responsibility' Mrs Foster explained that she would wait to see what recommendations Health Minister Robin Swann would present at Thursday's executive meeting about further restrictions before coming to a firm position on new restrictions. The difficulty ""is the law of diminishing returns"", the first minister outlined. ""It is about taking responsibility, but at the end of the day people have to take their own decisions."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said people planning to meet others over Christmas needed to be ""very careful"" about limiting their contacts. She said there was no doubt ""that an intervention is required"", but the timing of action by the executive needed to be a priority. The deputy first minister said she was prepared to make the ""right decision"" on restrictions and not the ""popular one"". ""I am up for doing whatever is required so I'll work with Executive colleagues tomorrow to try and arrive at a position that actually delivers that,"" she said. She continued that it is a ""very difficult time"", however, ""Christmas will be here next year also"". Mr Swann urged people to ""simply walk away"" if something ""makes you feel uncomfortable"" when mixing with family this Christmas. 'Time is precious' Department of Health officials have also issued a joint letter to the care home sector in Northern Ireland, urging visits for residents to be made possible over the Christmas period. Mr Swann previously said ""forceful encouragement"" could be necessary if some care homes did not change their visiting arrangements. Current guidance permits one care partner per family to visit once a week, but some homes had expressed concerns about that plan. The letter said as an additional assurance, Covid-19 testing will be made available to one visitor or care partner per care home resident each week up to 8 January. It is from the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride, Chief Nursing Officer Charlotte McArdle and Chief Social Work Officer Sean Holland and says ""there is a need for care homes to understand and appreciate the right to a family life for those living in a care home setting"". ""This time is precious and if lost could be irrecoverable,"" it adds. ""As the minister has stated publicly, it is difficult to understand how some care homes have been able to facilitate visits while others have not.""","The threat of coronavirus will hang over Christmas and ""cast a shadow well into January"", Health Minister Robin Swann has said."

"Clive Greenaway, 52, from Stratford-upon-Avon, died when his plane came down in fields near Sibson Airfield. Mr Greenaway may have been distracted by a plane departing from the airfield, said the report from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). He had flown to Sibson from Long Marston Airfield in Warwickshire. The runway in use had what is known as a displaced threshold - an area beyond the normal end of the runway - to provide an approaching aircraft with adequate clearance from the transmission lines, the report found. 'Pilot's unfamiliarity' The AAIB said: ""Evidence suggested that the pilot made an approach to the start of the prepared runway surface, rather than the displaced threshold. ""The pilot's unfamiliarity with the airfield, distraction due to a departing aircraft in front and inadequacies in the briefing material may have been contributory factors to the accident."" The aircraft - a Bolkow 208C Junior - came down close to the A1 - a section of which had to be closed for several hours following the crash on the afternoon of 2 September 2011. It was Mr Greenaway's first flight to Sibson, near Peterborough. The report said the lack of evidence of any technical failure suggested Mr Greenaway would have been able to avoid flying on to the power transmission line. ""It is possible that he was unaware of its [the power line] presence when he commenced his approach,"" said the report. ""Even if the pilot had been aware of the presence of the power transmission line, the cables would have been difficult to see."" The AAIB said the owners of the power line had entered discussions with the airfield operator and the Civil Aviation Authority to prevent a recurrence of the accident.","A pilot killed when his light aircraft hit power lines in Cambridgeshire may have been unaware the lines were there, an air accident report has said."

Mr Martin told the paper: ""I think it is a matter of when, not if and we will be fortunate to come to the end of the decade without having a category one attack."" He also warned that whilst he had not seen any successful attempts to interfere with the UK's democratic process, there may have been intelligence-gathering taking place for possible future attacks. Mr Martin said: ""What we have seen from Russia thus far against the UK is a series of intrusions for espionage and possible pre-positioning into key sectors but in a more controlled form of attack from others."" Cyber 'shift' The most serious cyber attack on the UK so far took place in May 2017 when WannaCry ransomware hit the NHS. The attack was classed as a category two incident as there was no risk to life.

""Since the start of the year we have opened for snow sports on 24 days with limited terrain and uplift available. ""The poor season has had a huge impact on our winter revenue, which is crucial to sustain the operation during the summer months."" She added: ""As a snowsports destination, we have to ensure that regardless of peaks and troughs in snowfall and therefore visitors, that we are adequately staffed so that we can continue to deliver a great experience for visitors. ""The current review of our workforce at CairnGorm Mountain is being carefully managed to ensure that enough resources and staff remain in place to cope with demand at peak times.""","The operator of the CairnGorm Mountain snowsports centre, near Aviemore, has started consulting staff on potential job losses at the site."
"The Sunderland-based travel agency made headlines in 2019 when it took on more than 2,000 former Thomas Cook staff. The firm was founded by Dame Irene's husband John Hays, who died in November after collapsing at the head office. Dame Irene said she was ""absolutely overwhelmed"" but the honour was ""bittersweet"" as she could not share the moment with her husband. She also said the honour was in recognition of the firm's successful apprenticeship scheme over the past 40 years, adding: ""I feel this really isn't an award just for me, it's for all the people who have created the right environment for all those people to succeed and the apprentices and the young people themselves."" Dame Irene said before the Thomas Cook acquisition that 47% of Hays Travel senior managers had started as apprentices at the firm. ""It's always been a real team effort,"" she said. Dame Irene said: ""For me it really does feel bittersweet. ""When I first heard I thought 'I can't wait to tell John', and obviously John's not here to tell. He would have been immensely proud."" Hundreds of mourners lined the streets of Sunderland to pay their respects to Mr Hays at his funeral, which also saw several buildings around the city lit up in the company's colours of orange and blue. Before it took on hundreds of Thomas Cook shops, Hays had 190 stores, 1,900 staff, and sales of Â£379m, reporting profits of Â£10m. At the time Mr Hays described the purchase as ""a game-changer"" which almost trebled the firm's number of shops and doubled its workforce. However, in August, the couple warned almost 900 employees may lose their jobs due to coronavirus travel restrictions, which hit destinations such as Spain. Hays Travel said it had a two-year turnaround plan in place, and that although 2020 ""looked really bad"", bookings for 2021 were already up on the same period in 2019.

"The Department for Transport (DfT) has put forward tough new penalties for the offence, including unlimited fines. Shining a laser into the eyes of driver, sailor or pilot could lead to ""catastrophic incidents"", according to police. Under current legislation the maximum penalty for using lasers against a pilot is Â£2,500. Only aircraft are covered by existing legislation but The Laser Misuse (Vehicles) Bill, published on Wednesday, expands the types of transport which are covered to include trains, buses, boats and hovercraft. Prosecutors will no longer need to prove intent, just that a laser was used. It will be an offence to dazzle or distract the operator of a vehicle either deliberately or if reasonable precautions to avoid doing so are not taken. Three jailed for laser pilot attacks Laser dazzles pilot 'for miles' Pilot targeted by laser speaks In February 2016, a New York-bound plane was forced to turn back to London Heathrow Airport when a a laser beam hit the cockpit after take off, causing a ""medical issue"" for one of the pilots. Since 2011 there has been about 1,500 laser-related incidents involving aircraft each year. Some 1,258 were reported in 2016, with attacks at Heathrow alone rising by a quarter year-on-year to 151. The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) lead for lasers, Cdr Simon Bray, said shining a laser at an aircraft or another moving vehicle is ""deeply irresponsible and dangerous"".

"By Eleanor BradfordBBC Scotland Health Correspondent I spent the morning with the Scottish Ambulance Service's Special Operations Response Team, who have been deployed to help keep the ambulance fleet moving. At 0900 GMT I joined paramedic Gordon McNeil and ambulance technician Peter Anderson for the start of their shift in a specially-equipped Land Rover. They're specially trained to deal with unusual events, be it chemical spills, terrorist attacks or extreme weather. Gordon said: ""I've been with the ambulance service a long time and this is the worst snow I've seen. ""Our job is to make sure the service can continue to operate at times of extreme pressure."" We head for Lanarkshire. It's usually a busy beat for regular vehicles but many of them are now having trouble reaching people in residential side streets. Our first call is to a man who's attempted suicide. Driving at high speed with blue lights is stressful in normal conditions. Today it takes nerves of steel. Pete said: ""The conditions on the road are really treacherous, so you've got to really watch your speed."" Drivers in front of us panic when they see the blue lights and create dangerous situations by slamming on their brakes. He added: ""Pull over safely if you can, and if you can't pull over because of the snow then continue your journey and let the driver of the emergency vehicle make the decision and navigate around you."" We arrive to find an ambulance has made it through the snow ahead of us. Pete and Gordon check it can get back on to the main road to take the casualty to hospital. Minutes later and we're on our way again - this time to an old lady who has collapsed in a supermarket. Again, a regular ambulance is on scene, but as we see them off we're called to Bellshill where a man has collapsed. We arrive to find a paramedic whose fast response estate car has gone as far as it can. He's about to head up the hill on foot. Gordon and Pete give him a lift in the Land Rover. The man has regained consciousness but needs to go to hospital There's no way an ambulance will make it up the steep snow-bound hill so the crews have to carry the casualty in a wheelchair all the way down. Offering comfort The doors of the ambulance have only just closed when a woman comes running down the hill in tears. She said: ""Excuse me, can you help me? Could you take a look at my wee boy? He's cut his head but I can't get my car out to take him to hospital."" Gordon puts a comforting arm around her and walks with her back up the hill while Pete follows in the four-wheel-drive. The toddler has a nasty cut above his eye and will need a stitch but is otherwise OK. Pete and Gordon take them down to the main road in the Land Rover and keep them warm while they wait for another ambulance to arrive. In emergencies they can take casualties in the back of the Land Rover but in these conditions it's more efficient to get casualties another ambulance so that the Special Operations vehicle is freed up to get to the next emergency. There's just time for a flask of hot coffee and a slice of Christmas cake before the phone goes again. I leave them as they dash up the motorway to what's thought to be a major gas leak. The snow may stop the daily grind, but the drama of daily life goes on.",Scotland may have ground to a halt in the snow but that doesn't stop people having heart attacks and falling sick.
"The 1,600-year-old floor panel showing a leopard attacking an antelope was unearthed in Dewlish, Dorset, in 1974. The government placed a temporary export ban on the piece, which was extended until January to allow Dorset County Museum time to raise the funds. It means the fragment can be reunited with two other sections from the same mosaic, also cared for by the museum. Museum director Dr Jon Murden described the piece as ""a critical part of this county's heritage as well as being internationally significant"" and ""one of the most significant 4th Century Roman mosaics in the country"". The mosaic, measuring 2m by 2.4m (6.5ft by 8ft), was discovered in the grounds of Dewlish House, near Dorchester, and is thought to have formed part of the flooring of a Roman villa. The government said it had been advised to suspend its export to an international collector due to the ""exceptional workmanship"" and research value of the piece. The museum in Dorchester said it received 100 donations, including Â£50,000 from the Arts Council England/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, Â£40,000 from Art Fund, Â£30,000 from the Headley Trust, and Â£10,000 from the Association for Roman Archaeology. The panel will go in display in the new galleries of the museum, which are due to reopen later this year following a Â£16.1m redevelopment. Dr Murden said it would ""take pride of place within the restored historic stairwell at Dorset Museum"". Dr Clare Randall, vice-chairman of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society, said: ""The mosaic is not only beautiful, and one of the finest examples of figure work from Roman Britain, but it is part of the story of the Dewlish villa and its inhabitants.""

"By Bethan BellBBC News About 8% of Londoners now live in tower blocks. Some flats are bought for millions; others are relatively low-cost social housing rented from a local council at a fraction of the private rate. Grenfell Tower itself was designed in 1967, started in 1972 and finished in 1974. Originally built as municipal housing as part of the slum clearances of the 1960s, it had 120 one- and two-bedroom flats over 20 of its 24 storeys, and was renovated in 2016. It's in a neighbourhood ranked among the most deprived 10% in England. Just two miles away - or four stops along the Circle/Hammersmith and City line - is 3 Merchant Square, a 21-storey tower that is part of a new development around Paddington Basin. The contemporary block was finished in 2016 and holds 60 apartments over 15 storeys. It's a different world. The penthouse apartment was sold for Â£7.5m. One-bedroom flats are at least Â£1m. Surrounded by restaurants and bars, workers and residents can lounge on deckchairs on a newly-built floating park. Lunchtime yoga sessions are held and there's a luxury fitness club. There's an enormous fountain and a bridge created by renowned designer Thomas Heatherwick, a nursery and winter garden. But nice though these peripheries undoubtedly are, they don't keep people safe from fire. For that, we must have a look at the specifications of the apartments in the tower. Once you get past the sales brochure description of 3 Merchant Square's walnut cutlery drawer inserts and integral wine coolers, the adjustable mood lighting and heated bathroom walls, you come to the fire safety details: Every flat has not only ceiling mounted smoke detectors but sprinklers. The International Fire Sprinkler Association (IFSA) says that automatic fire sprinkler systems are the single most effective fire protection measure available, and are able to make up for a wide range of other fire protection deficiencies. There has never been a multiple loss of life from a fire developing in a building protected by a properly designed, installed and maintained fire sprinkler system. While fire sprinkler systems have been required in new high-rise residential buildings in England since 2007, it is not compulsory to retrofit them into existing buildings. So Grenfell Tower had none. Former chief fire officer Ronnie King, honorary secretary of the all-party parliamentary group on fire safety and rescue - which had recommended fitting sprinklers to buildings to save lives - said the regulations ""badly need updating"" and ""three successive ministers have not done it"". ""My own thinking is there was the red tape challenge and they don't really want to put regulation on to businesses, adding a burden. ""It's one of those that if you bring in a new regulation, you have got to give three up to get it."" A 2012 report by the British Automatic Fire Sprinkler Association (BAFSA) concluded that fire sprinklers could be retrofitted with tenants in place at a cost of about Â£1,150 a flat. Since the 24-storey Grenfell Tower contained 120 flats, it would have worked out at Â£138,000. That's significantly less than the Â£2.6m spent on the cladding and replacement windows. Do you live in a tower block with similar cladding to Grenfell Tower? Let us know by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Architect and fire expert Sam Webb said: ""We are still wrapping post-war high-rise buildings in highly flammable materials and leaving them without sprinkler systems installed, then being surprised when they burn down. ""I really don't think the building industry understands how fire behaves in buildings and how dangerous it can be. The government's mania for deregulation means our current safety standards just aren't good enough."" Some of these issues were raised in a report following a fatal fire at a tower block in 2009 in Camberwell, in which six people were killed. Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said his predecessor in the role had accepted the report's recommendations and put them into action. ""The coroner did not recommend new planning regulations. The coroner recommended a change in the guidance. There is a lot of information out there and it is right that it is independently looked at by a judge-led inquiry,"" Mr Javid said. When asked whether the government would retrofit sprinkler systems to tower blocks, he said: ""I don't think we can immediately jump to the conclusion that sprinklers is the issue here. We will do whatever it takes."" Another factor adding to the building's fire risk, according to the Grenfell Action Group, was the fact that in the past rubbish, having accumulated in the hallways of the tower, was not collected. At one point, the only emergency exit to the building was cluttered with an old mattress, sheets of cardboard and a broken heater. It's hard to imagine residents in 3 Merchant Square having to put up with rubbish filling the corridors. An associate pastor of Notting Hill Community Church, Danny Vance, says ""the poor are constantly neglected"" in the city. ""The disparity between rich and poor in this city is disgusting,"" he said. ""This would not have happened to the Â£5m flats around the corner."" The gap between rich and poor The average salary in the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea, in which the tower block stands, is Â£123,000: the highest in the UK. But the median average - the midpoint of all salaries in the area - is Â£32,700. No other local authority in the country has such a large gap between these two averages, pointing to a huge contrast between high and low earners. There is a similarly large gap when measuring the total income for people in the area. The average is Â£158,000, but the median is Â£38,700. Again, no other local authority in the UK reports such a difference. In laymen's terms, it means that the total income in the area, if distributed among the local population, would be Â£123,000 per resident, the highest in the UK. Yet half of the population there earns less than Â£32,700, highlighting the extreme disparity between top earners and those at the lower end of the spectrum. Source: Department for Communities and Local Government, the Office for National Statistics, and Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs. Hannah Mansell, chair of the Passive Fire Protection Forum and trustee of the Children's Burns Trust, said: ""I regularly sit in meetings with fire safety professionals, and their fury and frustration at the inaction of local councils and social landlords is palpable. ""We have been warning about the risks of a fire like this for years. ""'What we need to get people to take notice is a huge fire in a tower block' they say. ""Well, here it is. There's an endemic fire safety problem in this type of housing stock."" As Ronnie King says, ""it's sad that we always have to go to stable-door legislation"" after a tragedy.

"The cash will also be made available to councils and economic sectors, such as the automotive industry. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said she would ""consider making"" a further funding announcement closer to the UK's departure from the EU. The funding pot is part of changes to minister's Â£18bn 2019-20 budget. It is the first of two supplementary budgets for the current financial year. The Â£85m package, made available by reallocating Welsh Government reserves, includes: Speaking ahead of a debate on the supplementary budget in the Senedd, Ms Evans said: ""It really is our duty as a responsible government to be preparing for all potential outcomes and part of that is the announcement that I've made today which does seek to give confidence to the construction industry in particular but also then to the wider supply chains which rely on it."" Ms Evans said the Welsh Government was ""in an absolutely incredible situation"" of not knowing about its revenue budget for the next financial year from the UK government's Treasury. The minister said: ""The Comprehensive Spending Review promised by the UK government hasn't materialised and the chief secretary to the Treasury said that she didn't expect it to be forthcoming this side of the summer recess, which really does suggest to me that we will potentially looking at a roll-over revenue budget for next year, which would be deeply disappointing. ""There's absolutely no sign that the UK government's promise that austerity is over is actually anything they're prepared to demonstrate in financial terms,"" she added. With the increasing possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October, Ms Evans said the Welsh Government is sensing a ""certain amount of Brexit fatigue"" amongst Wales' business community. The Labour AM said: ""One thing that we have some real concern about is the fact that many businesses have been marched up the hill and then marched down again and they, in many cases, made some major changes to their businesses, so stockpiling components and so on. ""But then they didn't need to because Brexit didn't happen. ""There's a reluctance on the part of some businesses to go to that effort again based on the fact that a no-deal Brexit might not happen,"" she added.","The Welsh Government has made Â£85m available to be spent on social housing and roads to ""boost"" resilience in the event of a no-deal Brexit."
"The scheme's developers say electricity generated by the six-mile lagoon would power 150,000 homes for 120 years. Ex-Lib Dem Energy Secretary Sir Ed Davey accused Conservative ministers of delaying the project for too long. A government-commissioned review backed the Â£1.3bn lagoon scheme in January. Ministers would have to agree a deal on the level of subsidy required for the energy generated and a marine licence would also need to be approved. The Swansea Bay project, involving 16 turbines along a breakwater, is seen as a prototype for much larger lagoons. These could include one off the coast of Cardiff - east of Cardiff Bay - Newport, Bridgwater Bay in Somerset, Colwyn Bay and west Cumbria, north of Workington. The Lib Dems said more than 30,000 jobs could be created across Wales by the schemes. Sir Ed said tidal lagoons were ""vital for creating Britain's low carbon future and will provide extremely reliable and consistent energy for at least 120 years"". ""Liberal Democrats would go ahead immediately with the lagoon at Swansea Bay and start planning for further lagoons in Wales and other parts of the UK,"" he added. In January, current Energy Secretary Greg Clark said ministers would consider the recommendations and ""determine what decision is in the best interests of the UK energy in the long term"". 'Taken for granted' The Liberal Democrats are aiming to reverse their decline in the polls next month, after losing two of their three MPs in Wales at the 2015 general election. In last week's local elections the party lost 11 Welsh council seats and now has 62 councillors in Wales. Welsh Lib Dem leader Mark Williams was joined at the campaign launch in Cardiff by UK party leader Tim Farron, who warned Wales would suffer if Mrs May won a big majority on 8 June. ""If the Tories get a landslide, Wales will be taken for granted,"" he said. ""It is time that we gave the people of Wales, the people of the United Kingdom some hope.

The Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) which is financially supporting the college said it must find a ""long-term solution"" to its funding issues. The college said it aims to merge with a sixth form college to reduce its costs. The further education college, caters for 16-to-18-year-olds as well as adult learners and has about 5,000 students. Its financial report revealed its deficit had grown by Â£1m in 2018-19 and a Â£500,000 overdraft facility had been removed by Santander bank, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. The report showed it had Â£5.86m of loans outstanding with Santander.

"Ms Dugdale, who backed Owen Smith for the leadership, said last month she did not think Mr Corbyn could ""unite our party"" or ""lead us into government"". However, she said his re-election should be a ""new beginning"". Mr Corbyn saw off challenger Owen Smith with 61.8% of more than half a million votes, to be re-elected Labour leader. Ms Dugdale called on the party to ""harness the energy and enthusiasm of its movement"" and turn it into real change for people. 'Effective opposition' The Scottish Labour leader, who has recently secured more autonomy for the party north of the border, added: ""Jeremy can unite the Labour Party, but he needs to want to unite it. ""That means he needs to work with both the party across the country and MPs to provide an effective opposition to the Tories in Westminster. ""It will be a difficult task for Jeremy, but not an impossible one. Likewise, the Parliamentary Labour Party must recognise that a divided Labour Party serves no-one. ""We can't fight the Tories when we are fighting each other."" Despite his majority, a YouGov poll that questioned 1,019 Scottish Labour Party members eligible to vote in the leadership election between 21 and 23 September found Mr Corbyn only had the support of 40% of members compared with 58% for Mr Smith. Chairperson of Scottish Labour for Jeremy, Neil Findlay, described Mr Corbyn's re-election as ""fantastic"".

He said: ""They've put a huge effort in to turn the support that we knew was there for Jeremy into votes and I'd like to thank every single one of them."" The Scottish secretary of the Unite union Pat Rafferty said it was time for Labour supporters to unite behind Mr Corbyn. He said: ""Unite members decided to back Jeremy's campaign because they know that we need a different kind of politics and a different kind of economy, in Scotland and right across the UK. ""For too many people in Scotland, finding a job is an uphill task, made harder by unjust sanctions that can leave them destitute and reliant on foodbanks."" 'Hopelessly divided' He added: ""Now that the contest is over, we look forward to people uniting behind Jeremy and opposing the austerity cuts that have been made in Westminster and handed on by Holyrood."" In Glasgow, about 20 supporters of Jeremy Corbyn gathered at a pub to celebrate his re-election. They applauded in The Dram as the result was declared from a special conference in Liverpool. One of the organisers of Mr Corbyn's campaign in Scotland, Stephen Low, who was at the Glasgow event, called on Ms Dugdale to throw her support behind the re-elected leader. He said: ""I think what's important about Kezia is not what she said. It would have been better if she'd stepped aside from this contest. But what matters is what she does now. ""She needs to accept this result. And she needs to show and acknowledge that she accepts the will of the party members and gets behind Jeremy Corbyn and the agenda that is clearly the settled will of the Labour party."" But rival parties claimed Labour would still be bitterly divided, despite the ballot result. 'Progressive forces' SNP Business Convener Derek Mackay also congratulated Mr Corbyn on his victory, but accused the party of ""overlooking"" its duties as the official opposition.

"They are part of a long-term plan to cut the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000. The government plans to increase the number of reservists. Ministers said the cuts were ""unavoidable"" and the Army would be ""more flexible and agile"" in future. But Labour said the plan was ""flawed"" and warned that Army morale was low. Of the 4,480 Army personnel being made redundant, 3,765, or 84%, have volunteered for redundancy, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said - up from 72% in the previous round of cuts. There will 715 compulsory redundancies, making up 16% of the total. Those serving in Afghanistan, and those preparing for or recovering from deployment, will not be made redundant in this round of cuts unless they have volunteered. 'Failing strategy' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: ""It is with great regret that we have had to make redundancies to deliver the reduction in the size of the armed forces, but unfortunately they were unavoidable due to the size of the defence deficit that this government inherited. ""Although smaller, our Armed Forces will be more flexible and agile to reflect the challenges of the future with the protection and equipment they need."" But shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: ""The government has a flawed plan for reforming the British Army. There is a huge effort going into sacking soldiers but nowhere near as much is being done to plug the gap by recruiting new reservists.""

'Unsettling' process The MoD aims to reach its target of 82,000 regular soldiers by 2017 while the number of reservists is to increase from 15,000, in 2010, to 30,000 in 2018. The latest cuts - the largest single tranche of redundancies - come at a time when the MoD is still negotiating its budget settlement ahead of the Whitehall spending review on 26 June. BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said the latest redundancies were a result of the almost 8% cut to the MoD's budget announced in 2010 - and a powerful reason why the department has argued it cannot face more cuts in manpower in the current spending round. She said different ranks and fields of expertise had been chosen for redundancy, with volunteers asked to come forward. The restructuring of the Army was an unsettling process for many soldiers and their families, she added. Maj Chris Braithwaite, who left the Army this week after he was told a year ago he would be made redundant, said the timing meant he was 87 days short of being entitled to much better pension rights. ""We feel we've been let down and the trust we've placed in politicians and military leaders has not been repaid,"" he said. Army Families Federation chief executive Catherine Spencer told the BBC it was a ""really difficult day"" for those who had been handed compulsory redundancies, ""a day that they will have been dreading for some time, as they come to terms with considering where they're going to live, what job they'll do next, where their children will go to school"". But she praised the Army for ""worked really hard"" to make its redundancy package ""really attractive"". The Army says that, even as it makes the latest redundancies, it still needs to recruit 10,000 new soldiers and officers this year, as well as 6,000 reservists. It says this is necessary to keep its structure and age range in balance, with both soldiers and officers needing to start at the bottom of the hierarchy. In response to a freedom of information request from the BBC, the MoD said the Army, navy and air force together recruited over 35,000 operational staff between October 2010 and February 2013. Redundancy pay-outs for service personnel over the same period have totalled Â£194m, the MoD added. The Army's Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Peter Wall, said: ""We aren't just going to carry on doing the things we have in the past. We're going to put a greater dependence on reserves and contractors, as we have been to a large extent in Afghanistan. ""By doing things differently and by making sure that we focus our military manpower on the jobs that absolutely have to be done by people in uniform, we shall be able to sustain a brigade in the field on an enduring basis, and put a division into the field when we need to. We'll still be able to deal with the challenges of the future."" On Friday, he had warned gaps between military resources and planned capabilities caused by spending cuts ""could become quite dangerous, quite quickly"". Prime Minister David Cameron, also speaking on Friday, said the UK had ""very strong armed forces and ones the whole country can be proud of"". ""We're not going to be making further cuts to the numbers of our Army, navy or air force, they know what they have available."" But he said ""no department can be excluded from being efficient, from saving money, from making sure we get the best possible value for every pound that we take from the taxpayers and spend"".","Nearly 4,500 Army personnel are being told they have been made redundant in the third and biggest round of job cuts since the 2010 defence review."

"By Andrew PickenBBC Scotland News The train operator had signed up to a UK-wide pledge to stop the practice of emptying raw sewage on to the railways. But severe delays to a fleet of refurbished trains means ScotRail will still be using rolling stock without toilet waste tanks next year. The firm said it is working to introduce the refurbished trains as soon as possible. ScotRail was meant to have received 26 refurbished high-speed trains, with waste tanks fitted, for routes linking Scotland's seven cities from rail firm Wabtec by December last year. Only eight of these models - which date back to the 1970s but have been renovated - have been delivered so far. ScotRail has been forced to hire 'classic' trains, without waste retention tanks fitted, to make up some of the shortfall and nine of these will still be in operation next year. 'Disgusting conditions' Mick Hogg, the RMT union's regional organiser in Scotland, said: ""We are livid that this promise has been broken. ""Why should our members be subjected to these disgusting conditions, being sprayed by this foul waste, as they go about their work at the trackside. ""This deal has been a disgrace for taxpayer and the travelling public, who is asking the serious questions of why these refurbished trains are going to be years late."" The practice of dumping sewage on the railways was ended by ScotRail in 2017. However, it was reintroduced last year as an interim measure after delays to the fleet of refurbished intercity trains. A number of other rail operators across the UK will also miss the 2020 waste target. Research by industry regulator, the Office of Road and Rail, found that the risk of infection to railway workers from the waste was low. A ScotRail spokesman said there was no specific legislative requirement to have retentions tanks fitted to the trains but they are being fitted as the rolling stock goes through its refurbishment programme. He added: ""We're working with suppliers to ensure the refurbishment of our fleet of high-speed InterCity trains is completed as soon as possible."" A spokesman for track operator Network Rail said: ""We are committed to putting an end to trains emptying waste onto the tracks and we are working with all operators to make this happen. ""There are a few train companies that have been given a bit more time for a small number of their trains and we are tracking their action plans closely to make sure they comply.""",ScotRail has admitted it will not hit a target of stopping the dumping of human waste onto railway tracks by 2020.
"The A83 at the Rest and Be Thankful was covered in earth and debris as 75mm (3in) of rain fell in 24 hours. Road operator Bear Scotland said the A83 and the nearby old military road would remain closed on Sunday night. It added that the landslide had continued through the day and engineers were unable to conclude safety assessments. The route only reopened on Monday following a 10,000 tonne landslide at the beginning of August. About 1,000 tonne of debris is thought to have moved down the hillside on Sunday morning, according to Bear Scotland. The roads firm said it happened at the same place as the earlier landslide. Much of it was ""caught"" in temporary mitigation measures including a pit and a rockfall barrier. Eddie Ross, the road operator's north west representative, said: ""This is another major landslide event and the on-going nature of it and the continued heavy rain has meant we are unable to conclude a full safety assessment."" He said the roads have been closed because a ""safety-first approach"" was required. The closures mean motorists will have to follow a 59-mile (95km) diversion. A Met Office yellow warning for rain is in place across parts of the west of Scotland until midnight on Sunday. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) said 75mm (3in) of rain fell in 24 hours at the Rest and Be Thankful over the weekend. There were similar levels of rainfall across the country and a series of flood warnings and alerts were in place. Sepa duty flood manager Mark Franklin said Scotland had been ""battered"" by another weekend of wet weather and there had been flooding in the west, central, north of and south of Scotland. ""Whilst Sunday sees an improving picture for central and southern Scotland, we'll see continued heavy rainfall across the day for the north west,"" he added. ""This is likely to result in further localised flooding of land and roads, as well as some transport disruption before improving on Monday. ""People living, working and travelling in these areas are advised to ensure they have signed up to Floodline and are prepared to take action to protect property.""","A trunk road through Argyll has been closed by a ""significant landslide"" for the second time in six weeks."
"Dave Wilson, from Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, said his surgery, Argyle Medical Group, had just eight GPs looking after 22,500 patients. Retirements and a lack of people moving to the area are adding to the shortage. Hywel Dda health board has faced ""significant workforce challenges"" despite recruitment efforts. Dr Wilson, 37, said he was not a ""prolific tweeter"", but was attempting to drum up interest after seeing the number of doctors at his surgery almost halve. ""Staffing issues are chronic, but it's becoming acute,"" he said. ""The thing that keeps me going is we have a really good team. ""But the problem is we've had retirements and people leaving, but they're not being replaced. Less and less people are moving down [to Pembrokeshire]. ""We've got beaches, it's a lovely place to work, but people just see tired GPs and that puts them off."" Dr Wilson said there had been no suitable applicants since his tweet. He said two schemes were on offer to help GPs with their workload, but because they were so busy, ""don't have the resources"" to free staff up to help. In November, Dr Charlotte Jones, chairwoman of the Welsh General Practitioners Committee (GPC), said general practice was ""on the brink of an abyss"". Newly-qualified doctors are often drawn to big cities or decide not to become GPs. An auditor general report into Hywel Dda University Health Board found long-standing recruitment difficulties and increased service demand. Swansea University Medical School has a ""doctors for Wales"" strategy to tackle shortages, including work experience for sixth-formers with a local GP and mentoring and taster projects, while working to encourage more Welsh-speakers to go into medicine. Jill Paterson, of Hywel Dda health board, said: ""The shortage in the GP workforce remains a UK-wide challenge, and the practice, together with the university health board continues with ongoing recruitment campaigns and exploring new ways of working. ""This includes a focus on the wider practice team with the introduction of extended roles in the surgery such as nurse prescribers and pharmacists, who can help to ease the pressure on GPs.""","A GP has tweeted a job advert for his surgery saying: ""I won't sugarcoat it... we're heavily undermanned and the hours stink."""
"A marine biologist has said it could take years or even decades before the river recovers after a pollutant entered the water. Dirty water entered the river, near Comber, and removed the oxygen in the river. Ian Kittle said it had ""absolutely devastated"" the entire ecology of the river. Two government departments are investigating. Martin Hamilton, the farmer responsible for the pollution, said he was deeply sorry and explained that water used for washing crops on his land had leaked into the river. He estimated about 25 tonnes, or 25,000 litres, of the dirty water left the farm. Mr Kittle, who lives in Comber, said he had spoken to Mr Hamilton. 'Cast-iron guarantee' ""He assured me that it was biological oxygen demand (BOD) which was used on his farm, which in layman's terms is organic waste that takes an awful lot of oxygen out of the water as it's breaking down and that is essentially what has caused the fish kill and the potential other damage to the river,"" he said. Mr Hamilton said he would ""throw every resource"" to ensure the river would recover and gave a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that he would replace any lost fish stock. Mr Kittle said many types of fish lived in the river. ""It's a brown trout and sea trout river, those are the fish that have been placed in and bred over the last 40 or 50 years, but the big problem is there's a whole range of other fishes in there,"" he said. ""There's flat fish, eels, sticklebacks, there's a whole range of fish in there, and while it's possible to put in more brown trout and sea trout, the other species just aren't going to be replaced, they are going to have to be naturally brought back in gradually without human intervention."" The Enler River flows into Strangford Lough. Mr Kittle said the only ""small saving grace"" was that it appeared the tributaries running into the main river had not been affected. Evidence ""Depending upon the damage that has been done, not just to the fish and invertebrate species in the river and potentially how much has been lost, it could be years, perhaps even decades, before the river returns to normal,"" he warned. The Department of the Environment (DoE) described it as a water pollution incident of ""high severity"". The DoE said a ""definite line of inquiry"" was being followed. It said evidence was being collected from premises with a view to prosecution. A joint investigation is being carried out by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, part of the DoE, and the Inland Waterways and Fisheries branch of the Department for Culture, Arts and Leisure. The DoE said it had been alerted to the fish kill following an anonymous call to the water pollution hotline on Thursday. An inspection was subsequently carried out by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency.","Almost 5,000 dead brown and sea trout have been found after a fish kill on the river Enler in County Down."
"Two members of a mental health support group were told they could not ride the Bridgnorth Cliff Railway without masks, despite showing staff they were exempt. Government guidelines allow some people not to wear face coverings and say they will not be expected to prove this. The railway said its ""robust"" policy was in the interests of staff safety. Malvern Tipping, whose family has run the Bridgnorth attraction for generations, said a lot of its staff were elderly and had reported passengers using ""fake"" lanyards to indicate an invisible disability, although he was unable to say how these were identified. To protect staff, he said the railway would only allow people to board without face coverings if they have a signed letter from a GP or are clearly severely mentally or physically disabled. Shropshire mental health group Sunny Spells Cloudy Days claimed there was ""no evidence"" of fake lanyards being used and a spokesperson said he was ""so angry"" about the railway's policy. ""Anywhere we go, we are challenged for not wearing a mask,"" he said, adding that banning people exempt from wearing coverings ""is discrimination"". ""He's saying unless you look severely mentally or physically disabled you've got to wear a face mask, which is a clear breach of government guidelines."" The guidelines say a number of people are exempt, including those for whom wearing or removing a face covering will cause severe distress. Mental Health charity Mind said coverings can be ""especially problematic for people living with anxiety disorders"" and can lead to panic attacks. Stephen Buckley, from the charity, said: ""It's really important not to make assumptions about other people you come across who don't have their faces covered. ""Openly challenging this behaviour... is likely to negatively affect their mental health.""

"The project will see the M3 between the M25 in Surrey and Fleet in Hampshire changed to a four-lane road, with the hard shoulder used as a permanent lane. Electronic signs will be installed to manage traffic flow. The company said preparation would begin next month with building work due to begin in the autumn. Smart motorways use technology to vary speed limits in response to driving conditions. There are different types of smart motorway, with some making use of the hard shoulder. 'Air quality concerns' The scheme, which covers 13.4 miles from junction 2 to junction 4a, is due to be finished by spring 2017. Balfour Beatty said the upgrade would increase capacity, reduce congestion and shorten journey times for the 120,000 motorists using that part of the network each day. Project director Julian Lamb said traffic management during the work would include 50mph speed restrictions, contraflows and narrow-lane running. But he said lower speed limits helped traffic flow, with lane closures limited to night-time and dual three-lane running for daytime and peak flows. The M3 passes through Chobham Common - an area of heathland in Surrey. Balfour Beatty said it would be using a sustainable design which took ecology into account, and natural habitats would be reinstated and enhanced. Earlier this month, a plan to impose a 60mph speed limit on that part of the M3 to cut air pollution was put on hold by Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin, with the Highways Agency asked to look at other ways of tackling pollution. The government has said the M3 smart motorway will improve journey times by 15%, but the Highways Agency has raised concerns extra traffic will cause EU air quality rules to be broken.","A Â£129m contract to convert part of the M3 in Surrey and Hampshire to a ""smart motorway"" has been awarded by the Highways Agency to Balfour Beatty."
"By Dominic CascianiHome and legal correspondent District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said there were substantial grounds to believe he would abscond. On Monday, she ruled the Wikileaks founder cannot be extradited to the US because he might kill himself. The US is now appealing that decision - and had opposed releasing the 49-year-old from a maximum security prison before the case is heard. Mr Assange, who was wearing a dark suit and face mask, was not seen to react to the decision at Westminster Magistrates Court. He's been held in prison since 2019, after hiding for seven years inside the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition. US prosecutors want to put him on trial for hacking and disclosing classified information - including the identities of informants who were helping intelligence agencies in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. In her ruling, DJ Baraitser said Mr Assange still had the incentive to abscond. ""He is willing to flout the order of this court,"" she said. ""As a matter of fairness, the US must be allowed to challenge my decision and if Mr Assange absconds during this process they will lose the opportunity to do so."" During the bail application, Mr Assange's barrister Ed Fitzgerald QC said his client had been offered a London home by a supporter, where he could be with his partner and their two young children - but also compelled to remain under the strictest bail conditions. ""Your decision [on Monday] changes everything and it certainly changes any motive to abscond,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. ""On any view... [Mr Assange] would be safer isolating with his family in the community, subject to severe restrictions, than if he were in Belmarsh which has, very recently, had a severe outbreak...(of coronavirus). He wishes to live a sheltered life with his family."" But Clair Dobbin, for the USA, told the court Mr Assange had the ""resources, abilities and the sheer wherewithal"" to secretly arrange a flight to another country. ""[Mr Assange] regards himself as above the law and no cost is too great, whether that cost be to himself or others,"" said the barrister. Julian Assange's partner, Stella Moris, was among a large group of his supporters who had gathered at court. ""This a huge disappointment,"" she said. ""Julian should not be in Belmarsh prison in the first place. I urge the [US] Department of Justice to drop the charges and the President of the United States to pardon Julian."" District Judge Baraitser blocked Julian Assange's extradition on Monday, ruling that that while he had a case to answer, he was so mentally unwell that the US authorities could not guarantee he would not kill himself once inside a maximum security prison in the country. The USA's appeal against that ruling - which will go to more senior judges later this year - will challenge that finding.",Julian Assange will remain in jail as he continues to fight against extradition to the United States.

"Glasgow is currently in level three, with the Scottish government expected to announce whether it can move down to level two. The city's infection rate has been accelerating, so it could remain in level three. It may be joined by East Renfrewshire, where case numbers are also on the up. East Renfrewshire only moved down to level two on Monday, as restrictions across much of the country were eased. Prof Devi Sridhar told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We should remember that it's data that should be driving this, not dates. ""And while it is painful to move backwards, what we've seen, for example in Moray, is that actually early action in holding it brought the numbers down so they can be released earlier."" Her University of Edinburgh colleague, Prof Linda Bauld, expects Moray to drop to level two, Glasgow to remain at level three and said there was a ""real possibility"" East Renfrewshire will move up to level three. She also told the programme she was concerned about current levels in Clackmannanshire, East Dunbartonshire, Midlothian, North Lanarkshire and Fife. Earlier this week, with the exception of Glasgow and Moray, mainland Scotland moved to level two. Most of the islands moved to level one. Moray had been kept in level three over concerns about its infection rate, and surge testing was brought in as the vaccination roll-out was widened to include younger adults. The infection rate in the area is now decelerating, leading to speculation it may be allowed to move into level two. According to official statistics published on Thursday, the weekly case rate in Moray had fallen to 36.5 per 100,000. In East Renfrewshire it had reached 118.3 by 17 May - meaning the infection rate had overtaken Glasgow's, which was 112.1 cases per 100,000 people. Glasgow's outbreak is concentrated in the south side of the city, where levels of infection appear to be much higher. Covid cases across Scotland have been rising over the last few weeks, with fears the surge in Glasgow is being driven by the Indian variant. The strain is thought to spread more easily than the Kent variant that caused the winter spike in infections, and has been found in pockets across the UK. This will be the first coronavirus briefing since the new cabinet was revealed, with the first minister being accompanied by her new health secretary, Humza Yousaf. The decisions for today are not as stark or difficult as some that have been taken in St Andrew's House - but they are uncomfortable. The situation in Glasgow is improving - but it's likely the city will be held at level three. We might be told this is for another week before the next review, but realistically this situation may last for another two or three weeks. The decision for Moray is fairly easy. People there hope to be placed in level two as the situation improves, and that looks likely. The toughest one is East Renfrewshire. The case rate is high (118 per 100,000) but the small council area means the actual case numbers are relatively low, as Professor Linda Bauld pointed out this morning. If they do go back up to level three, remember the area only entered level two on Monday. It's this yo-yo effect that ministers wanted to avoid. What happens here will be a significant decision. It sets the precedent for what might happen around Scotland as we start to live with the disease as the vaccination programme progresses. What's allowed in different Covid levels? Under level three restrictions, groups of six people from two households can meet in cafÃ©s, pubs and restaurants. However, alcohol can only be served outdoors. And six people from six households can meet outside. But, you cannot visit people in their homes. Under level two restrictions, which East Renfrewshire is currently in, pubs and restaurants are allowed to serve alcohol inside until 22:30, and limited numbers of people can socialise indoors. Social distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens is no longer required in levels one and two. Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, music venues, comedy clubs and bingo halls can reopen with restrictions. The infection rate is a key indicator of which restriction level an area should be in, with upwards of 50 cases per 100,000 seen as a threshold for level three. The weekly case rate is one factor that will be considered, but others include the ability of the local NHS to cope. Scotland's national clinical director said a decision was yet to be made on what would happen to Glasgow and East Renfrewshire. Prof Jason Leitch said public health officials would give First Minister Nicola Sturgeon further advice on Friday morning, before a cabinet meeting where a final decision would be made. It will be followed by a Scottish government briefing, which will be broadcast live at 12:15. Prof Leitch said: ""Glasgow continues to accelerate, East Renfrewshire continues to accelerate - but they are slightly different pandemics, as is Moray. Moray is decelerating. ""Glasgow... you could say is beginning to slow, the acceleration is beginning to slow - but certainly not out of the woods. And that means... everybody who lives here has to follow the rules... and we can hopefully turn a corner."" Questioned about why businesses were still operating under restrictions, Prof Leitch told Radio Scotland that experts could not be sure where transmission was happening. The only thing that could be said for certain was that it was transmitted when people mixed. ""When you decide you're going to restrict, we have to make that judgement somewhere. Level three does allow a lot of relaxation. A lot more people meeting indoors and out. ""Level two is a massive because it allows people in each others' homes, and that's why we're nervous about it."" There are difficult decisions to be made by government ministers on restrictions. A wide variety of factors will help them to decide. Weekly case rates per 100,000 of the population are an important measure. But in areas with lower populations you will see bigger fluctuations. A small rise in cases linked to a known source, like a school or a factory, could push that figure up quite rapidly. The percentage of tests that come back positive is also useful. The seven-day positivity rate for the whole of Scotland is 1.5%. In Glasgow city where there has been a huge expansion of testing, it is still only 4%. In East Renfrewshire, another area of concern, it is 4.1%. One of the most important factors for officials to take into account is what is driving the infections. Can they identify sources and put in place measures? Or is there sustained community transmission? That was why Moray was held in level 3. Geography, population density, community response will all be taken into account, as will the capacity of hospitals to cope with any rise in cases. The biggest unknown at this time is what will happen to the new B1617.2 variant, first identified in India and believed to be behind the outbreak in Glasgow's Southside. Public health figures show that confirmed cases of this variant have gone from 35 to 136 in one week. Scientists say it is more infectious but just how much is not yet known. The expectation is that vaccines will hold up but it's too early to say for sure.","A decision is expected to be announced on Friday about whether the Covid restriction levels in Glasgow, East Renfrewshire and Moray will change."
"Tracey Lisk from Swansea says the pig called Nessa has not stopped growing since she bought if last February. She said she never expected it to get anywhere near its current size.

"A total of 38 people, including 30 Britons, were shot dead by a gunman in Sousse in June 2015. About 80 people, including relatives and those injured, have instructed lawyers to commence civil proceedings, law firm Irwin Mitchell said. TUI said it would fully cooperate with the judicial process. On 26 June 2015, a gunman opened fire on holidaymakers staying in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui, just north of Sousse in Tunisia, killing 30 British tourists and eight others. So-called Islamic State (IS) said it was behind the attack by Tunisian student Seifeddine Rezgui. Kylie Hutchison, a solicitor for representing the families of 22 victims and more than 50 people who were injured, said damages would compensate for their suffering, financial losses and treatment to aid their recovery. She added: ""The level of terrorist threat in Tunisia had been escalating for some time prior to June 2015. ""This included a failed suicide bomb attempt outside a beach hotel in Sousse in October 2013 and an attack at the Bardo museum in Tunis in March 2015 in which 22 people were killed. ""Despite this, TUI, the tour operator who organised the holidays and was responsible for our clients' safety, did not audit the adequacy of security at the hotel or take appropriate precautions to keep our clients safe from an attack."" Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith ruled at the inquest, in February 2017, that the 30 Britons were unlawfully killed but rejected a finding of neglect against the tour firms and the hotel. Mat James, 33, from Pontypridd, South Wales, was shot multiple times while protecting his girlfriend during the attack and has had many operations on his leg. He said: ""The horrible attack was obviously life-changing for so many people. Even now, a few years on, my injuries are still affecting me."" A TUI UK spokesman said: ""We remain truly saddened by what happened on that fateful day in Sousse in June 2015 when 30 of our customers lost their lives in a terrorist attack which started on a public beach. ""Our thoughts remain with all of those who were affected by the horrific incident.

Lisa Nobes, chief nurse at Suffolk and north-east Essex Integrated Care System (ICS), said action was being taken. She pledged all people over 80 would be offered the vaccine by 31 January. According to the latest published figures, 22,265 people over 80 in Suffolk and north-east Essex have had their first jab, and 4,790 of those have had their second dose. That represented just over a third of the over 80s in the area, and put it at the bottom of the table nationally. Meanwhile, more than 31,000 aged under 80 had received the jab, the figures up to 17 January showed. Ms Nobes said the system was ""not perfect and we are trying to fix it as we go"". She said they had now inoculated 50% of the over 80s and had vaccinated people living and working at 98 of the county's 125 care homes - and were on target to reach them all by Sunday. ""I'm desperate to reassure people that we are just off the starting blocks,"" she said. ""We are a bit behind because we wanted people to have centres close to them. We set up 22, it's taken us some time, but we are absolutely ramping it up."" 'The worry is making my father ill' Ann Fiddy says her 90-year-old father has still not received any communication about his Covid vaccination. He lives in sheltered accommodation in Ipswich with his wife of 66 years, who is 89. Ms Fiddy said: ""Mum has had her vaccine because their Ipswich surgery had a mobile contact number for her. ""My father does not have a mobile, and unfortunately we did not think to give the surgery her number for him. ""Dad has to wait for a letter and the worry is making him ill and he is not sleeping. ""He is registered blind, hard of hearing and uses a wheelchair. He is worrying that he will never have the vaccine."" Ms Nobes said communication with patients had also been improved. ""We are listening to people, we know that some people are having real problems but we are moving now to a phone model for all sites,"" she said. The ICS is only responsible for part of the vaccine roll-out. The Suffolk GP Federation is responsible for organising the vaccination of patients from 28 GP practices who are able to travel to one of five vaccination centres it has set up in Suffolk. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who is also the MP for West Suffolk, said the supply of vaccine was the ""rate-limiting factor for the roll-out"". He told MPs: ""Ultimately this is a UK programme delivered by the devolved nations by the NHS, being done brilliantly by the NHS.

"Debbie Dorling's husband Brian, 58, was killed on a cycling superhighway at the Bow Roundabout on 24 October. A lorry driver was arrested and bailed. A 34-year-old woman died on the same stretch of the A11 on Friday afternoon. Transport for London (TfL) said it was investigating the crashes, along with the police. The road layout, with vehicles turning left across the cycle lane, was ""a recipe for disaster"", Mrs Dorling said. ""And it is a disaster for us,"" she added. The superhighway is one of four which have been created around London to encourage cycling, with a lane painted blue on the left-hand side of the road. 'Just so needless' Mrs Dorling, who lives in Hounslow, west London, said her husband was an experienced cyclist who would ride about 200 miles (320km) a week in the summer as he travelled to work. He was killed after telling a colleague he was about to stop cycling for the winter because the days were becoming far shorter, she added. ""I think it's a definite design fault with the superhighway. ""I don't know who designed it and how they got away with it, but what they're doing is mixing cyclists with a left-hand turn."" She went on: ""It would appear that they've actually chosen speed of traffic over safety. ""When I look at the junction, it was just so needless. ""What possessed them to design it the way they have?"" The lorry driver detained over Mr Dorling's death was bailed until Friday. Separately, a lorry driver was arrested after Friday's collision and bailed until 7 December. TfL said there had been ""an 18% fall in the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured on London's roads in the last decade, compared to TfL's baseline figures from the mid to late-1990s"".","More cyclists will die unless a busy road junction in east London is changed immediately, the widow of one of two recent crash victims has said."
"Protesters from Extinction Rebellion attached themselves to walls and to each other at the financial centre in the City of London. A group also climbed on to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf and held up banners. Protesters at both locations were later removed, but police warned of disruption throughout the day. Elsewhere in the City, temporary road blocks have been set up by activists at Bank and Southwark Bridge. Nine protesters also glued themselves together in a chain outside the Treasury, preventing people from the entering the Westminster building. Others glued themselves together on Fleet Street outside the Goldman Sachs bank headquarters. Extinction Rebellion is urging the government to ""tell the truth"" about the scale of the climate crisis. It wants the UK to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and a Citizens' Assembly to oversee the changes needed to achieve that goal. It said protesters would spend the day focusing on the financial industry ""and the corrosive impacts of the financial sector on the world we live in"". The 13 activists who blockaded the stock exchange wore LED signs reading ""climate emergency"", ""tell the truth"" and ""you can't eat money"". One protester, Adam Woodhall, said they had targeted the building because ""people are making millions, even billions of pounds out of trading ecological destruction"". The London Stock Exchange said markets were all open as normal in spite of the action. Four people stood on top of a DLR train holding signs saying ""business as usual = death"" and ""don't jail the canaries"". Another activist glued herself to a carriage. Services were able to continue on the DLR, but there were minor delays between Bank and Stratford/Lewisham. Officers from British Transport Police used ropes, harnesses and ladders to remove the protesters. Five people had been arrested on suspicion of obstructing the railway, the force said. On Thursday, 26 people had been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespassing outside the Stock Exchange and on Fleet Street, bringing the total number of arrests up to 1,130 since the protests began on 15 April, the Met Police said. The Met said on Wednesday it imposed new conditions on the protest area in Marble Arch, making it a criminal offence to protest outside a designated area or incite others to protest outside of it. Anyone not sure what is included in the area, marked in red on the map, should ask one of the officers there, the force said. The conditions, which were imposed under the Public Order Act, will remain in force until 14:45 BST on Saturday. The group had previously said it would end its action later in the day, having previously blocked sites including Parliament Square and Waterloo Bridge. Extinction Rebellion protesters also remain at Marble Arch, although no roads have been blocked there. Meanwhile, Dame Emma Thompson, who joined the activists on Saturday, has defended flying from Los Angeles to London to take part. The actress said it was ""very difficult to do my job without occasionally flying"" but she was ""in the very fortunate position of being able to offset my carbon footprint"".

The group said it would hold a ""closing ceremony"" at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park at 17:00 BST. In a separate protests, environmental activists gathered at the Royal Bank of Scotland's (RBS) headquarters in Edinburgh, demanding further action to combat climate change. The campaigners are calling on the bank and others to fully commit to ending the financing of fossil fuel projects. An RBS spokesman said: ""Our exposure to the power, oil and gas sectors has reduced substantially in recent years and now accounts for approximately 1.2% of our total lending.

"A series of child deaths saw the service branded a ""national disgrace"" and it has been rated as inadequate since 2008.

"The coastguard service said she was in ""imminent danger"" at Brean on Wednesday morning as the tide rose, with the water up to her neck. Crews from Burnham-On-Sea coastguard, the RNLI and BARB Search & Rescue assisted in the operation. The woman was wrapped in a blanket before being assessed by paramedics. A hovercraft and two lifeboats were used in the rescue, in which two crew members attached to floating lines entered the water to reach the woman. They worked together to hold her up above the water while they freed both her legs before bringing her back to shore. A Burnham coastguard spokesman said: ""Our team was first on scene and as we entered the beach we could see directly in front of us the head and shoulders of the woman sticking up above the water as the constant waves made it challenging to keep her face out of the water.

"Commons speaker John Bercow will ask officials to open a recall petition once Chris Davies is sentenced, with a by-election to be held if 10% of the MP's constituents sign it. The Brecon and Radnorshire MP was convicted last Friday. Davies, 51, admitted to two charges relating to creating false invoices for Â£700 worth of photographs. The politician could have made the claim legitimately under a different process. His case was adjourned for sentencing at a future date at Southwark Crown Court. The figure needed to trigger a by-election is yet to be confirmed but it is thought around 5,300 names would be required. Davies had admitted to one charge of providing false or misleading information for allowances claims, and one of attempting to do so. A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said: ""As soon as the court has formally informed Mr Speaker that sentencing has taken place, procedures under the Recall of MPs Act 2015 require him to write to the returning officer in Mr Davies' Brecon and Radnorshire constituency. ""Once the letter has been sent, Mr Davies is subject to the recall petition process and it will be for the returning officer to make the arrangements for the petition. ""The recall petition will be open for signing for six weeks,"" the spokeswoman added. ""If at least 10% of the electorate in the constituency sign the petition, the MP will lose his seat and a by-election will be triggered."" Once called, a recall petition should be available to be signed at up to ten locations open from Monday to Friday between 0900 and 1700, with ""reasonable provision"" given for signing at other times. However, if a general election is called, that would halt the process.

"Plans to open the West Cumbria mine are on hold over climate change concerns. Cumbria County Council had originally backed the scheme but is now reviewing its decision. The MPs - many from former mining areas in the North of England - say blocking the project would pose ""a serious risk to Cumbria's economic growth"". In a letter to the council's Labour leader, they argue that the mine, in Whitehaven, West Cumbria, would fall ""within the government agendas for net-zero carbon emission by 2050. The MPs' letter was also signed by local Conservative leaders including Mike Starkie, Mayor of Copeland Borough Council and Ben Houchen, Mayor of the Tees Valley. One signatory, Tory MP for Workington Mark Jenkinson, accused Labour of ""failing workers in our industrial heartlands and denying more than 500 well-paid jobs in Cumbria"". The mine's supporters say using British coal would save the carbon emitted by shipping it from abroad. But Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has argued that 85% of coal due to be produced by the mine is earmarked for export. The suggestion that British coal is needed for UK steel is contentious. My enquiries among steel firms suggest that Cumbrian coal would save them some cash by allowing orders to be more flexible. Other industry figures I approached said coal supplies were plentiful on the world market - and that Cumbrian coal was not essential for them. The MPs' letter suggests that plans for the mine ""fall within the government agendas for net zero emissions by 2050"". But the government's independent advisory committee on climate change strongly opposes the mine, warning that any jobs it creates will be temporary, and that approving the project will undermine the PM's global leadership on the climate. Labour wants the government to invest in low-carbon steel manufacture. The UK is due to host a climate change conference this year and Mr Miliband said building the mine would ""undermine our credibility both at home and abroad"". ""People in Cumbria deserve good, secure jobs and there are so many crying out to be done in the green industries of the future,"" he added. The council granted permission to the project for the third time in October, but said it would reconsider following guidance from the government's advisory Climate Change Committee. The committee had said steel firms must stop burning coal by 2035 in order to meet the government's carbon emission targets. Even if Cumbrian councillors do approve the project, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick could still overrule them by cancelling the plans - and he may come under pressure to do so.",More than 40 Conservative MPs are calling for the UK's first new deep coal mine in 30 years to be given the go-ahead.
"A letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster, who is also first minister, has been circulated among DUP MPs and MLAs. The party said it would not be commenting. It is understood there is majority support among the party's Stormont and Westminster ranks - about 80% - for a change in leadership. It is believed 22 of the party's 27 MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly) and four MPs have so far signed the letter. Only a small number of the DUP membership - MLAs and MPs - will get to vote in a leadership contest. Mrs Foster has endured a turbulent time as DUP leader and the fall-out from Brexit - which the party supported - has put particular pressure on the party's top brass as it faces having to weather the storm caused by the Northern Ireland Protocol, which imposed a border down the Irish Sea. It has also been suggested that recent changes to NI's abortion laws and the commitment to implement an Irish language act were causing concerns with some elected DUP representatives ahead of next year's assembly election. She has not commented on the leadership move since Tuesday, but on Wednesday afternoon she tweeted to say she had visited a primary school in her constituency. In addition, a letter was sent from DUP councillors to the party chairman, Lord Morrow, stating they were ""severely worried"" about the state of the party and country and calling for Mrs Foster and deputy leader Lord Dodds to resign. ""We as councillors and as members are deeply concerned about the future of unionism, Ulster conservatism and the DUP,"" the letter states. ""As members and councillors, we have received the brunt of the anger from our voter base caused by ineffective leadership."" A separate letter from councillors in Lisburn and Castlereagh Council states the current party leadership ""no longer enjoys the confidence of the party membership , the majority of DUP elected representatives and most importantly the unionist people"". The group lists a number of issues which have caused them concern, ranging from the NI Protocol, abortion legislation, same sex marriage, policing and the recent gay conversion debate at Stormont. Arlene Foster is, in a sense, backed into a corner. We are waiting to hear how she is going to respond to this crisis of leadership in the party. Our understanding is that Lord Morrow, the DUP chairman, has not yet received the letter of no confidence in Mrs Foster. He has to be handed the piece of paper. It can't be sent electronically. Lord Morrow is in London at present but is due home on Thursday. He will be handed the letter then and is planning to meet Mrs Foster on Thursday night. That's not to say that Mrs Foster might not act herself and come out with her own statement on her future. It may well be the easy part to remove Mrs Foster from her position. The more challenging role for the DUP is to try to plot a way out of this and try to find a course to bring the party back together again. It is unchartered waters for the party. Normally the party has a vacancy filled before a vacancy arises. Now it finds itself sharply looking at the prospect of having a vacancy, but without anyone to fill it. How did we get here? Mrs Foster was elected as the first female leader of the DUP in December 2015, taking over from Peter Robinson. She was the only candidate. Her time at the helm has been seen many challenges, having faced Brexit, a botched green energy scandal which subsequently led to the collapse of Stormont for three years and Covid-19. The aftermath of Brexit has also caused friction both internally and between the party and some of its core voters who are unhappy at the deal which led to the Irish Sea border. The DUP has argued that it has never supported the Northern Ireland protocol and has actively tried to have it overthrown. For some time there have been rumblings of discontent, but Mrs Foster's internal enemies have lacked the numbers, or the courage, to act against her. Leadership stories Earlier on Tuesday, Mrs Foster played down suggestions her leadership of the party was under threat. It followed a report in the Belfast News Letter, which said there was internal party unrest over her leadership. But Mrs Foster said stories on leadership ""come up from time to time"". ""So we'll just deal with it and move on because I've bigger things to do, including getting us through this Covid pandemic, including listening to the concerns of working-class communities,"" she said. Mrs Foster posted a biblical verse from the Book of Psalms on her private Facebook page on Tuesday evening: ""It is God who arms me with strength and keeps my way secure"". Who could replace Mrs Foster? Possible contenders to replace Mrs Foster include NI Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots, Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson. There has been speculation of a split role, with one person for first minister and then a party leader at Westminster. Mrs Foster has represented the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency since 2003. In a statement, the DUP said on Tuesday it would not be commenting. ""Whilst understanding that there will be from time-to-time public interest in party processes, these issues, in the first instance, are matters for members of the party and we are not able to make any further comment at this time,"" it said. Meanwhile a planned North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting on agriculture did not go ahead on Wednesday after DUP minister Edwin Poots indicated he would not be taking part. Mr Poots was due to chair the meeting. The NSMC is the main body for cross-border co-operation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The DUP has been criticised for not attending previous NSMC meetings, with claims it is boycotting some NSMC meetings due to their opposition to post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. Mrs Foster has said this was not the case, although she has said North-South relationships will be affected by the NI Protocol. On Wednesday, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill described Mr Poots' decision not to attend the NSMC meeting as ""hare-brained antics"". Charlie McConalogue, the Irish agriculture minister, said he was disappointed at the move, while Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said ""targeting"" north-south relations was counterproductive. How would a leadership election work? DUP rules say a leadership election should be called by 30 April. Normally this is simply a formality and the existing leader continues in their role, but other candidates are free to challenge them. Only a small number of party members are eligible to vote in such a contest - MPs and NI Assembly members (MLAs). There are 27 MLAs that hold the party whip - including Mrs Foster - and eight MPs. Party rules currently state the leader of the party must be an MLA, but there has been talk of changing this rule to allow an MP to hold the role. The role of first minister is separate, but as the largest party from the largest grouping (unionism) in the assembly, the DUP is entitled to nominate someone to hold the post of first minister. If Mrs Foster stepped down as first minister, the DUP would then be asked to nominate a replacement within seven days and a vote would be held in the assembly. If a replacement is not nominated, then the Northern Ireland secretary is obliged to call an assembly election. The New Decade, New Approach deal, which was signed in January 2020 and restored the NI Assembly after a three-year hiatus, included a commitment to extend the time to appoint a new first or deputy first minister after a resignation from seven days to six weeks. However, this has not yet been legislated for. A UK government spokesperson told the BBC that ""good progress"" was being made with the legislation and it will be brought forward during the second parliamentary session. The turmoil in the DUP is being watched in Brussels. The European Commission would dearly love unionist leaders to reach some sort of pragmatic accommodation with the Northern Ireland Protocol. In fact, Arlene Foster was edging towards that position until the Article 16 controversy at the end of January, when EU moved to introduce controls on vaccines made in the bloc, including to Northern Ireland, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. It quickly reversed its decision following condemnation in London, Dublin and Belfast. Since then, unionist attitudes have hardened. There is no way an aspirant DUP leader is now going to make the case for living with a reformed Protocol. One of the favourites to replace Mrs Foster has had a role in implementing the Protocol. Edwin Poots is Northern Ireland agriculture minister and it is his department which operates the Irish Sea border posts. But Mr Poots has been assiduous in leaving a paper trail which shows that at every stage that implementation has only happened under orders from ministers in London.",Arlene Foster's future as leader of the Democratic Unionist Party remains in doubt on Wednesday as she faces a heave from within her own party.
"""They are not best able to manage their finances,"" he explained. Mr Gove said that the government would provide both financial aid and support to help them make better decisions. But Labour's Steve McCabe said the remarks, made on Monday in the Commons, showed that Mr Gove was ""out of touch"". Mr Gove had said during his departmental question session with MPs: ""I had the opportunity to visit a food bank in my constituency only on Friday and I appreciate that there are families who do face considerable pressures. ""It's often as a result of some decisions that have been taken by those families which mean that they are not best able to manage their finances. ""What we need to do is to ensure the support is there not just financially but also to make sure that the right decisions are made."" 'Vehemently disagree' Mr McCabe said: ""Michael Gove has managed to be both insulting and out of touch. ""Families forced to go to food banks should not be stigmatised by secretaries of state. The spiralling number of food banks across Britain should be a mark of shame for this government."" The education secretary had been responding to a question from Labour's Luciana Berger, who raised concerns about food banks distributing school uniforms to parents. She said on Tuesday that she was ""appalled"" by his response. ""I have visited several food banks and I have spoken to many service users,"" she said. ""There are many parents both in and out of work who are struggling to get by because they have been hit by this government's cost-of-living crisis. ""People I have met are ashamed to have to turn to food banks. I vehemently disagree it is because they have mismanaged their finances. ""This government has got no answer to the millions of parents that are really struggling to get by."" Oxfam has said the rising number of people using food banks is due to low wages, rising prices and failings in the welfare system that are dragging people into poverty.","Opposition MPs have accused Education Secretary Michael Gove of ""insulting"" people who use food banks by suggesting they were often responsible for their own predicaments."
"The Greenpeace activists had placed five large steel containers outside each of the entrances to the building in St James's Square. Kitted out with food, a chemical toilet and internet access, each box contained two protesters who were expected to remain in place for several days. But Met Police officers removed them in the early evening, making 10 arrests. Earlier, four people were arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass after protesters abseiled down side of the building to block windows and display banners. The aim of the protest was to keep BP's headquarters closed ""for at least the whole of this AGM week"", Greenpeace said. The company's annual general meeting is set to take place in Aberdeen on Tuesday. Activists want BP to end exploration for oil and gas, and only invest in renewable energy. In a statement, BP said: ""We welcome discussion, debate, even peaceful protest on the important matter of how we must all work together to address the climate challenge, but impeding safe entry and exit from an office building in this way is dangerous and clearly a matter for the police to resolve as swiftly as possible.""",A climate change protest which blocked entrances to BP's head office in central London has now ended.
"Kathleen Etty-Leal died in Worcestershire with her ashes buried at a local church in 1993. But a judge granted consent for them to be exhumed so her wishes to have them scattered in Powys could be honoured. A Church of England Consistory Court was told her ashes had been buried ""at the insistence"" of a former daughter-in-law. However, the marriage between one of Mrs Etty-Leal's sons and his wife had ended, which prompted Mrs Etty Leal's daughter Sarah Worboys to make the request to the court. It was told Mrs Etty-Leal wanted her ashes scattered on the hills north of Newtown, where her ancestors come from, even though they were interred at St Bartholomew's churchyard in Naunton Beauchamp, Worcestershire. Charles Mynors, chancellor of the diocese of Worcester, in his role as a judge of the court, ruled that although he considered it a ""borderline"" case, he believed the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional for him to grant permission for exhumation and pave the way for Mrs Etty-Leal's wishes to be honoured. He said no-one had been able to explain to him why the views of the daughter-in-law prevailed over those of Mrs Etty-Leal's four children. The chancellor said other members of the family backed Mrs Worboy's request, saying they remembered Mrs Etty-Leal speaking of her wishes for her ashes to be spread over the Welsh hills, and her adding that she was claustrophobic and did not wanted them putting underground.",A woman's wish to have her ashes scattered on the Welsh hills is set to be fulfilled 26 years after her death.
"The legislation gives 70,000 teenagers the vote and also gives voting rights to 33,000 foreign nationals. A total of 41 assembly members voted for the bill, just exceeding the two-thirds majority of 40 votes needed. The assembly will be renamed Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament as part of the changes. Labour, Welsh Government ministers and Plaid Cymru backed the bill, but the Conservatives and the Brexit Party opposed it. The decision was backed with the help of Presiding Officer Elin Jones and deputy presiding officer Ann Jones, who do not normally take part in Senedd votes. Ms Jones said the law would ""empower young people to participate in the democratic process"". ""This bill, in my view, will create a more inclusive, diverse and effective Senedd,"" she added. But the inclusion of votes for foreign nationals following Welsh Government amendments earlier in the process upset the Conservatives, despite some having backed votes for 16-year-olds.

Lara Evans, 19, from Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, said she ""100%"" would have voted at 16: ""I think 16 is a completely responsible age to give people the vote."" ""Young people are definitely more engaged in politics,"" Geraint Williams, 19, from Cardiff, said. The musical theatre student, who is undecided but leaning towards Labour, added: ""We're realising that it's our future and we are the future generation and that we have the opportunity to make the final decision."" As well as 16 and 17-year-olds, the Senedd and Elections Bill will allow foreign nationals resident in Wales to vote in assembly elections - beyond those EU and Commonwealth citizens who can already take part. David Melding, Conservative AM, said the new name was an ""appropriate recognition"" of the assembly's powers, but the foreign national measures had been added without consultation in a way that was ""quite insulting frankly to those with genuine concerns with lack of scrutiny"". ""This novel idea is not common practice anywhere else, as far I'm aware,"" he said. He claimed the bill, which was introduced by the Assembly Commission but has been significantly amended, had been ""hijacked by the Welsh Government"". Scotland gave 16-year-olds the vote in 2013 for the 2014 independence referendum. Ms Jones said the move was ""long over due"" in Wales. But Brexit Party AM Mark Reckless said by voting for the bill, ""the partiality and bias"" of the presiding officer ""has been demonstrated"". ""This time it will have a serious impact on the constitutional arrangements of Wales,"" he warned. Ms Jones said assembly rules allowed ""for the presiding officers - for the Llywydd - me, to vote where a super majority is required and that was required today in the passing of today's constitutional bill"". Why is the assembly getting a new name? The bill's passage follows a row about what the assembly should be called. There have been calls stretching back to 2012 for the assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament, in recognition of its growing role in making law. Plaid Cymru and others, including in Labour, wanted the Welsh-only Senedd. A majority of AMs in the end agreed to call the institution Senedd Cymru/Welsh Parliament, with the support of the Welsh Government, but AMs will be called Members of the Senedd in future. Welsh Government minister Jeremy Miles told the chamber ministers will use the term Senedd to refer to the assembly. ""We have won by default,"" Plaid's Rhun ap Iorwerth said. While disappointed with the name, he said the legislation was an ""important milestone"". He said the law ""formally notes the assembly's flowering into a national parliament for our country"". The name Senedd, he said, would have shown ""we are confident in our heritage, united in our future, and that we celebrate what makes us unique as a country"". The bill includes measures to stop councillors from also being AMs and disqualify registered sex offenders from joining the Senedd.",Sixteen and 17-year-olds will be able to take part in the 2021 Welsh Assembly election under a new law passed on Wednesday.
"The Â£17m gallery opens next Saturday in Margate, on the seafront site of a cottage where JMW Turner lived. Emin grew up in the town and last year unveiled a pink neon love letter to Margate. The work was later sold to raise money for the gallery. Director Victoria Pomery said Holland had a long-term relationship with Kent. The musician owns 14th Century Cooling Castle, near Rochester. Chairman of Turner Contemporary, John Kampfner, said the gallery opening marked the start of an ""extraordinary opportunity for Margate and Thanet to become one of the UK's most compelling culture and tourism destinations"". Ms Pomery said it would be ""a momentous day"". New commissions She said an ""extraordinary but little-known painting"" by Turner, The Eruption of the Souffrier Mountains, was already in place for the launch. The opening exhibition, which has the Turner painting at its centre, includes four new commissions and explores themes of imagination, discovery, wonder, and the creative spirit. Building work on the gallery, designed by architect David Chipperfield, started in November 2008. The gallery is the focus of plans to regenerate the Kent town. Thanet council has pledged to bring empty shops back into use and improve the town's signage, lighting, seafront shelters, railway station forecourt, and Arcadian Hotel. Arts Council England, the South East England Development Agency and Kent County Council are among bodies which provided funding for the gallery.","Artist Tracey Emin and musician Jools Holland will open the Turner Contemporary gallery in Kent, it has been announced."
"Lincolnshire Rape Crisis will also offer face-to-face counselling for female rape and sex assault victims. The centre comes as it was revealed that a third of all reported rape incidents in Lincolnshire last year were dropped by police - the highest percentage in the country. It has been funded with support from the Ministry of Justice. It will have three full-time staff but will also need about 20 female volunteers to offer counselling and advice to women in the county. The rape crisis group said it would support women whether they want to press charges or not. Lincolnshire Police recorded 110 adult rapes in the 12 months to the end of March 2013, and subsequently decided 36 (33%) had not taken place. In contrast, the average ""no crime"" rate for rapes in England and Wales was 12%, and the lowest was 3%, in Cumbria. Lincolnshire Police said there was not a ""culture of disbelief"", and it investigated all reports thoroughly.",A new rape crisis centre including a telephone helpline has been officially opened in Lincoln.
"Leader Leanne Wood said a ""strong opposition"" would be in the national interest if First Minister Carwyn Jones had a majority as a result. The Welsh Government has denied rumours that it may appoint former Plaid leader Lord Elis-Thomas. Labour won 29 seats at the May election, two short of a majority. It already has one minister from outside the party - Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams, who is education secretary. Plaid had formed the so-called ""compact"" with Labour in May following the deadlocked vote between Labour leader Mr Jones and Ms Wood over who should be first minister. Lord Elis-Thomas left Plaid Cymru in October to sit as an independent AM, claiming the party was not ""serious"" about supporting the Labour administration. Plaid came to a deal with Labour to back the Welsh budget the same month. 'Existing arithmetic' In a blog post on the Plaid website, Ms Wood said that ""co-operation hasn't happened by accident, and it cannot be taken for granted. ""It is based on the existing arithmetic of the assembly. ""If the arithmetic of the assembly changes, for example if any new assembly member is brought into the government from outside, then Wales will have a majority government,"" she said. ""In that case, the Welsh national interest would best be served by a strong opposition to Labour from Plaid Cymru. ""Under those circumstances, the compact would come to an end,"" she added. A Welsh Government source has denied Lord Elis-Thomas is being offered a ministerial job. A spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives said they ""stand ready to show Plaid Cymru the true meaning of strong opposition should it decide to unravel itself from Labour's cosy embrace"". ""Plaid Cymru's so-called 'compact' with the Welsh Government is little more than a sop, which is evident to all but Plaid Cymru,"" the spokesman said. ""In pandering to the whims of Carwyn Jones, Plaid is perpetuating a saga of mediocrity now spanning nearly two decades.""",Plaid Cymru has warned its co-operation deal with Labour will end if it appoints another AM from outside the party to the Welsh Government.
"West Midlands Police believes Antonio Russo, from Walsall, was driving the black Audi A4 which hit Rajesh Chand in Birmingham on 31 August. Mr Chand, 29, was crossing the Soho Road in the Handsworth area just before 04:00 BST when he was killed. The car which hit him was registered to Mr Russo, police said, but they have been unable to trace him or the Audi. Detectives believe the car registered to Mr Russo's address in the Rushall area was one of three that were potentially travelling together that night. The Audi has not yet been recovered, Det Sgt Paul Hughes said, adding the investigation was ""complex"". The force believes ID documents recovered from Mr Russo's home may be false, although he is thought to be an Albanian national. Det Sgt Hughes said he was also ""confident that the image is a true likeness of the man we are looking for"". ""Mr Chand was killed in tragic circumstances and his family need answers,"" he said.

"The Junction and Calton Athletic will share the proceeds of an auction of memorabilia from the sets of T2. The online auction takes place next month to coincide with the film's US release. Producer Andrew MacDonald said they chose to help The Junction because it works with young people on the ""very streets"" Trainspotting grew from. Mr MacDonald said: ""I was introduced to the Junction by their Patron Irvine Welsh last April and was so impressed by what I had seen that when it came to choosing the two beneficiaries of T2 Trainspotting Memorabilia Auction the Junction was an obvious choice.

"Leon Roberts and Jade Muzoka, from Derby, shared the images from their Turkish break on Facebook, Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court was told. They later pursued holiday firm TUI for about Â£2,000 each in compensation over a claim they had been ill. They both pleaded guilty to a single count of fraud at an earlier hearing. The pair were each handed a 26-week suspended sentence. Railway industry contractor Roberts, 38, of Holbrook Road, Alvaston, and fitness trainer Muzoka, 27, of Stenson Road, Sinfin, who are no longer together, spent a week at Cornelia Golf Resort and Spa in Turkey in July 2015. Despite the pair discontinuing their claims before they were given a pay out, TUI chose to prosecute them. Tim Hunter, prosecuting on behalf of the company, said ""the holiday went without incident"" and it was ""plainly apparent in their respective social media entries that they both enjoyed their time at the resort"". He said: ""They issued through their solicitors claims to TUI that they had suffered serious illness as a result of food consumed."" District Judge Jonathan Taaffe said their claims were ""akin to perverting the course of justice"". He added: ""This is not a victimless crime, the costs of this type of false claim are massive."" The judge also said claims firms seeking ""false"" business should be deplored. ""They bear a large responsibility for suggesting, as in this case, that this was easy money and risk-free,"" he said. The pair were also ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid community work and pay Â£1,115 to cover court costs.","A couple who claimed they had food poisoning on holiday posted pictures of themselves tucking into meals, a court heard."
"The council said occupancy levels have dropped from 90% in 2007 to about 70% at the Peoples Market, Butchers Market and General Market. A report said one option could be to shut the General Market, but councillors called for more investment at a meeting on Wednesday evening. The markets employ 250 people. The Butchers Market was built in 1848 and the General Market was built in 1879. Both are Grade-II listed. The Peoples Market opened in 1992. The report discussed on Wednesday said: ""The markets make a significant contribution to the local economy. ""The three indoor markets alone, at current levels of occupation, support approximately 250 jobs and prove a good, low risk route to self employment. ""They also contribute to the Green capital agenda, by encouraging recycling of books, furniture, electrical goods etc"" 'Crossroads' However, it added: ""The markets are at a crossroads. ""Not only are there external macro-problems, such as the recession, changing consumer spending patterns, the internet, but there are also micro-problems such as the changing retail configuration of Wrexham."" It said one option would be to close the General Market and relocate 10 occupiers to the other two markets. It said the option might be ""attractive"" in cost terms, but added that ""this solution is not advocated because it is recognised the closure of this landmark building in a core location within the town centre, even on a temporary basis, would have detrimental effect on the town centre"". The report recommended retaining all three markets, but said the next options ""are to consider the levels of investment and improvement necessary to achieve a viable and confident future"". On Wednesday evening the employment, business and investment scrutiny committee recommended in excess of Â£100,000 be invested in the markets, and a task group be set up to look at ways to turn around their fortunes. About 30 traders and other people attended the Guildhall meeting which recommends the action be taken by the council's executive committee which has the final say. Earlier this year, the council agreed to set up an action plan to try and boost the image and trade of Wrexham - north Wales' biggest town. An action plan will be set up to boost the image and trade of north Wales' biggest town.

"The advert, which appeared in Elle UK magazine, featured a photo of a woman whose rib cage was visible and appeared prominent, the regulator said. It upheld a reader's complaint that the advert was ""irresponsible"" for using a model who appeared unhealthily thin. Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) and Elle UK declined to comment on the ruling. The ASA said YSL ""indicated that they did not agree with the complainant's view that the model was unhealthily thin"" but did not provide a detailed response. Elle UK told the watchdog it had no comment to make on the complaint. The ASA said the model's pose and the lighting drew particular focus to her chest, where her rib cage was visible and appeared prominent, and to her legs, where her thighs and knees appeared a similar width. It said: ""We therefore considered that the model appeared unhealthily underweight in the image and concluded that the ad was irresponsible."" It ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form, adding: ""We told the advertisers to ensure that the images in their ads were prepared responsibly."" 'Dangerous catalyst' The charity Anorexia and Bulimia Care (ABC) said it hoped the ASA's ruling sends a ""clear message"" to other media and fashion companies, which it said have a ""great responsibility"". An ABC spokesperson told the BBC: ""We applaud the ASA for taking the necessary action to ban the YSL advert on the grounds of it being 'irresponsible.' ""While eating disorders are most often caused by underlying emotional issues or events, the impact of the media on vulnerable young people can act as a dangerous catalyst - triggering disordered thinking and behaviour. ""Adverts using underweight models are promoting a distorted image of beauty and yet this has become the norm in the UK."" The ASA's ruling came as figures from the NHS showed that the number of hospital admissions across the UK for teenagers with eating disorders has nearly doubled in the last three years. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said much of the increase was down to social pressure made worse by online images. College spokesperson Dr Carolyn Nahman said she was worried about what she described as the sometimes fatal consequences of vulnerable teenagers putting themselves under pressure by looking at pictures of ""ideal bodies"" repeatedly on social media. The eating disorder charity Beat cautioned that the rise in disorders reported by the NHS could also be due to better diagnosis and awareness, but said it showed it is ""vital"" that we protect young people from ""excessive influences"". A Beat spokesperson told the BBC: ""The ASA ruling is not about whether this person in the picture is healthy, but whether the images of her are being used in a way that can have an irresponsible effect on others and we are really pleased to see that they are taking action to uphold their responsibility for the social impact of adverts, as well as judging whether they are legal, decent, honest and truthful."" The charity said that the ""constant portrayal"" of a very slender look needs to challenged in order for young people to grow up with a robust sense of self-worth. Catwalk ban In April, French MPs approved a law to ban the use of catwalk fashion models deemed to be excessively thin. Under the new law, modelling agencies which employ models below a certain Body Mass Index (BMI) level face fines or prison terms. The law also penalises magazines which fail to state when photos have been retouched - with a fine of â¬37,500 or up to 30% of the amount spent on the advertising featuring the model. Ian Twinn, direct of public affairs at Isba, a trade body which represents advertisers, said Wednesday's ruling from ASA was ""useful in drawing a line over which advertisers must not cross"". He added: ""But there can be no simple template. Some people are naturally thin, some of us are sadly not. Advertisers and regulators need to apply common sense, as the ASA has, and not vilify the thin, the rounded and the simply overweight."" Earlier this year, a campaign for the YSL perfume Black Opium was cleared by the ASA in January following complaints that it glamorised and trivialised drug use and addiction. The French designer Yves Saint Laurent made his name when Christian Dior picked him to become his assistant at the age of 17. When Dior died three years later, Saint Laurent took over the Dior house. He went on to co-found what was to become the multi-million-pound Saint Laurent fashion and perfume empire in 1962. He died in 2008. The first major UK exhibition of the fashion of Yves Saint Laurent is to be staged at the Bowes Museum in County Durham next month.","An Yves Saint Laurent advertisement featuring an ""unhealthily underweight"" model has been banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)."
"Dover Coastguard was alerted after a woman reported seeing one person struggling in the sea and another shouting for help off Cooden beach. The alert prompted a response from Eastbourne and Hastings inshore RNLI lifeboats at about 08:30 BST. The RNLI said the incident was logged as a false alarm with good intent.

"He likened the party to a cockroach for its ability to survive but said this should not be taken for granted. Mr Farron said ""99%"" of people ""don't care"" about sexual harassment claims against the party's peer Lord Rennard. But he said the Lib Dems ""certainly appear to have let people down"" over the handling of the allegations. Lord Rennard, former Lib Dem chief executive, denies the allegations. 'Twists and turns' Mr Farron, who was speaking in an interview with the House Magazine, said: ""The party is in a critical state. We may well be cockroach-ish, but we shouldn't take that for granted. One day someone will stand on us if we are not careful. We shouldn't assume our survival is guaranteed."" He stood by his previous remarks that the party had ""screwed up"" over the Lord Rennard matter, but he said it was crucial the party did not now go into ""institutional self-defence mode"". ""I think 99% of the people out there just don't care, it's not been raised. I've done a lot of door-knocking both in Eastleigh and in my patch this last week. It was mentioned to me once, and that was in sympathy,"" the Westmorland and Lonsdale MP said. Mr Farron praised Nick Clegg as a good leader and said he was ""very popular"" within the party. ""Nobody else has had to withstand the kind of pressure that he has and the scrutiny and whoever was in that position would have to be dealing with all that and I think he's dealt with it brilliantly,"" he said, but added: ""I think there are a lot of twists and turns to go."" Mr Farron took a swipe at his Conservative coalition colleagues, branding David Cameron ""very weak"" and suggesting there were at least three Lib Dem candidates who could ""do a better job"" than George Osborne as chancellor. Referring to Mr Cameron, he said: ""There was a moment where he could have become a properly coalition, liberal Conservative centre-right prime minister and quite a statesman and quite a unifying prime minister, but for a variety of reasons he's become a very weak prime minister and in the grasp of his right, not even the intelligent right actually."" Mr Farron denied he wanted to replace Mr Clegg as party leader saying he was ""not at all"" focused on the leadership as ""there are more important things in life"". He told the magazine the only way to become a Lib Dem MP was by ""being a nutter and working your socks off"".","The Liberal Democrats are in a ""critical state"" and should not assume ""survival is guaranteed"", the party's president, Tim Farron, has said."
"The investment is backed by nearly Â£15m from the Welsh government with production due to start in late 2018. Economy Minister Edwina Hart said the deal would ""safeguard more than 750 skilled Welsh jobs for many years"". ""In a climate of stiff global competitiveness, we have been actively seeking to win a share of this investment for Wales,"" she said. ""Ford's decision to manufacture its new innovative engine here in Wales is a tribute to the reputation of the local management team and the quality and loyalty of the Welsh workforce,"" she added. The Ford Bridgend plant opened in 1980 and has fought fierce competition to win successive investments in the past worth more than Â£2.8bn. The company has said its presence supports around 10,000 jobs in south Wales, with 1,860 employed at the plant itself. Ford said technicians based in Essex and Germany had worked together on the design and development of a new fuel-efficient range of engines. A letter from Ford to workers seen by the BBC in June said that to win the investment there would need to be a change to working conditions at Bridgend to make the plant more competitive. Welsh Conservative shadow economy minister William Graham said Friday's announcement was a sign of ""confidence in the UK government's efforts to rebuild the economy"". Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This is good news for workers at Bridgend as the new production will begin in 2018, just as the manufacturing of Jaguar Land Rover engines at the site will be coming to an end. It secured hundreds of jobs that may otherwise have been in jeopardy. Two hundred fixed contract workers were let go at Ford Bridgend this year when it stopped manufacturing engines for Volvo. There are concerns, though, that the new investment will mean that Bridgend can only manufacture a third of the number of engines it does at the moment. Some question why the Welsh government should be contributing Â£15m to the investment of a multinational company in a plant it owns. Bridgend was in competition with three other European Ford plants for this work, all with governments offering financial support as standard. The automotive industry is so competitive internationally that without government backing, companies are likely to go elsewhere.",Ford's Bridgend plant will build the company's new generation of petrol engines in a deal worth Â£181m.
"The Â£20m scheme aims to reopen more than 150 miles of the River Severn, making it easier for endangered fish to reach their spawning grounds. The Environment Agency wants to reintroduce shad to the river, said to be one of King Henry III's favourite fish. Many species vanished after weirs were installed as they prevented migration. The project will also see England's only fish viewing gallery built at Diglis Weir in Worcester. Four fish passes will be installed which will allow fish to travel past the blockages, in Worcestershire; open up the River Teme to fish at two locations near Worcester; and improve access at a weir on the Severn near Tewkesbury. It is hoped the work will help to secure the long-term future of many of the UK's declining and protected fish species, particularly the locally-threatened twaite and allis shad which hundreds of years ago were a staple food in the court of Henry III. The work, including the removal of some trees along the river, is starting in February. Jason Leach, programme director, said: ""We're delighted to be starting work in Diglis and Bevere on what is a once in a lifetime project that will bring major environmental benefits to the river and the species that can thrive here.""

"A diabetic man who was rushed to hospital, potentially due to a lack of insulin, and residents being left unsupervised are among issues raised. Private care provider Discovery began running services in the county in 2017. The company said it took safety ""extremely seriously"" and any issues were ""robustly investigated"". Discovery, a registered charity, took over the care of more than 900 adults with learning disabilities from Somerset County Council nearly two years ago. Since then there has been a high staff turnover - many former staff told the BBC they left because they were unhappy with new terms and conditions. 'They didn't know him' Sarah Moore, whose son Marcus is severely autistic and lives in supported living at Badger Street Farm near Taunton, said she only found out he had been taken to A&E with diabetic ketoacidosis late last year when her husband turned up to bring him home for a weekend. ""It could be that somebody had forgotten to give him his insulin,"" she said. Mr Moore was removed from Discovery's care because of parents' concerns. ""We were not happy that it was safe. There was no-one that we knew or trusted,"" his father David Moore said. ""All the staff were either agency, or people that had just come in. They didn't know him. You need to be able to read the signals,"" Mrs Moore added. Pat Durbin said any trust she had in Discovery had ""completely gone"" after she discovered her son, Steven Bodycombe, got into a bath he filled himself, unsupervised, at a residential care home in Taunton last November. ""It could have been boiling hot water, it could have been freezing cold water. He's not that steady on his feet, he could have slipped and knocked himself out,"" she said. ""For him to be able to do that, and them not be aware until after the event... it's very worrying."" She said her son had also ""escaped"" and was found ""wandering around outside"", trying to get on a minibus. ""I've got absolutely nothing against the individual staff, they are lovely and very committed,"" she said. ""But they are inexperienced, most of them are very young, and they just haven't got the knowledge of what these guys need yet.""

"In the UK, women aged 50 to 70 are invited for a mammogram every three years - but they then must request one. A survey has found more than half (51%) of women over 70 do not know they can continue having the scan after receiving their final invitation. Breast Cancer Care said there is ""confusion"" about the current system and greater awareness is needed. Addie Mitchell, a clinical nurse specialist at the charity, said: ""It is crucial women know while routine invitations to screening stop at 70, this doesn't mean you're no longer at risk - as the biggest risk factors for breast cancer are being female and getting older."" ""So women must be armed with the information they need to make an informed choice about requesting screening appointments after the age of 70 if they wish to do so."" Opera singer Margaret Williams was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and called it a ""shock"". She said: ""When I reached the age of 70 I thought 'I'm fairly safe now'.""

About 10,000 people in the UK have the condition and about 25,000 are at risk. Mr Clark has said that it is ""disgusting"" that he cannot get access to the services that he needs. ""It is not fair that there is only one specialist nurse in Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""There is nothing out there for us and there should be."" Huntington's disease is passed on through genes, and children who inherit a faulty gene from parents have a 50% chance of getting the disease in later life. Mr Clark is cared for by his 23 year-old daughter, Laura, who has also been told she has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. She told BBC Radio Foyle that she is not ready to get tested for the condition just yet. ""It is hard to watch my dad knowing that that might be my future,"" she said.

"Amelia Lilly Sultan-Curtis died from a blow to the head on 8 October 2012. Natasha Sultan, 21, of Welton Grove, Hull, was given a three-year supervision order for infanticide. A serious case review found the death could not have been prevented but extra support for post-natal depression would have been beneficial. The review, commissioned by the Hull Safeguarding Children Board, said Sultan went to her doctor in September 2012, four weeks after her daughter's birth, and was prescribed anti-depressants having been diagnosed with depression. It later materialised that Sultan did not take the full dose. The report said: ""It is noted that the GP identified some potentially supportive, protective factors. ""However, consideration was not given to sharing this information with the health visitor and no arrangement was made to follow up Adult N [Sultan]."" 'Much-wanted child' It added: ""As the GP did not ask Adult N [Sultan] to return to assess the impact of the anti-depressants or contact the health visitor to request that she contacted Adult N [Sultan], the GP was not aware that she had not taken the prescribed medication."" During Sultan's sentencing last November, a judge at Hull Crown Court described how Amelia-Lilly was a much-wanted child but said it was ""plain"" that following the birth her mother suffered from post-natal depression and could not sleep. Describing the events on that night in October, the judge said Sultan killed her daughter ""by deliberately impacting her head upon a hard surface"". The court was told she claimed to have dropped her daughter accidentally, before eventually admitting that she caused the fatal fracture of the skull. Paul Dyson, chairman of the board, said ""local agencies and services could not have anticipated or prevented this tragic event"". However, he added: ""The board believes that the offer of additional support would have been beneficial, following a diagnosis that Child L's mother (Sultan) had post-natal depression."" Mr Dyson said a number of recommendations had been implemented as a result of the review including better information sharing among health professionals.","A mother who had post-natal depression when she killed her five-week-old baby should have been offered more help for her condition, a report has found."
"Mr Rhodes, chairman of the Cumbria Probation Trust, beat Labour's Patrick Leonard after a count of second preference votes. Independent Mary Robinson came third in the poll and Liberal Democrat Pru Jupe was fourth. Mr Rhodes will set the force's budget and priorities and hold the chief constable to account.

"A witness near Hick Lane, Batley, told the BBC he heard a ""massive bang"" on Wednesday night, with some nearby residents evacuated from their homes. The men, aged between 35 and 39, suffered burns injuries and remain in hospital. West Yorkshire Police initially believed it to be a gas explosion, but is now treating it as ""unexplained"". ""At this stage, we are not treating it as a terrorist incident,"" a spokesman added. Emergency services were called to the two-storey block of converted flats at about 18:45 GMT. The bomb squad also attended ""as a precautionary measure"", officers said. A Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal van was at the scene on Thursday morning, along with police, fire service and gas vehicles, but has since left. A police cordon remains in place in the centre of the town. Det Supt Pat Twiggs, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ""Police and partner agencies have worked throughout the night to ensure the scene is safe and there is no safety risk to members of the public. ""All injured parties are still in hospital receiving treatment for their injuries."" He added: ""We will be continuing with our enquiries throughout today and would like to thank the local residents and public for their patience whilst we establish the full circumstances of the incident."" One witness in a nearby building, who did not want to be named, told the BBC he heard ""a massive bang"". ""I've never heard anything like it,"" he said. ""I came rushing out to find glass everywhere, some even blew 300 yards. ""Then I saw two men exit the building covered in blood, smoking, obviously very shook up. It was like a war scene."" Yorkshire Ambulance Service confirmed the injured were taken to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield.","An explosion at a flat which injured five men was not caused by gas, police said."
"By Joshua RozenbergLegal commentator They said it was about the message in support of gay marriage that he had wanted on his cake. ""Now we're being told that we have to promote the message, even if it's against our consciences,"" Mr McArthur said. ""Other businesses will have to take advice about whether they can refuse orders that conflict with their consciences or whether they have to be coerced as well into promoting other people's views."" But there was nothing in the court's decision requiring Ashers or any other business to promote a view with which the company's directors disagreed. Ashers can keep within the law and not promote ""other people's views"" by confining its custom-made service to birthday cakes -- which is what it has said it will do. A Jewish or Christian shopkeeper is not required to trade on the Sabbath just as a Muslim butcher is not required to sell pork. But if a business does supply a service, it must not discriminate on grounds of sexual orientation â which means it must not refuse to provide a gay person with goods that it would provide to others. In this case, said the courts, the correct comparison was not with a straight man who wanted a ""gay"" cake, which Ashers would have refused. It was with a gay or straight person who ordered a cake celebrating traditional marriage -- which the company would have supplied. And, as the appeal judges said, ""the fact that a baker provides a cake for a particular team or portrays witches on a Halloween cake does not indicate any support for either."" 'Surprisingly straightforward' In the end, the appeal ruling turned out to be surprisingly straightforward. Had District Judge Brownlie been right as a matter of law to hold that Ashers had discriminated against Mr Lee directly on the grounds of his sexual orientation, contrary to regulations made in 2006? Yes she had, the appeal judges said. Had the district judge been right to decide that the regulations were not affected by the McArthur family's rights -- under article 9 of the human rights convention -- to hold and manifest their religious beliefs? Yes, she had been right about that too. And had the district judge been wrong to find, without any evidence, that Mr Lee had been perceived by Ashers as a gay man? That was irrelevant, said the appeal court: Ashers had cancelled Mr Lee's order not because he was perceived as being gay but because the company's directors opposed gay marriage. It is because the district judge had simply posed a series of questions to the appeal court â what lawyers call an ""appeal by way of case stated"" â that there may be procedural difficulties in Ashers appealing once more to the UK Supreme Court in London. One way round these problems might be for the Attorney General of Northern Ireland to seek permission to appeal â either from the court in Belfast or from the Supreme Court itself. John Larkin QC had argued, unsuccessfully, that the 2006 regulations were discriminatory and therefore unlawful under devolution legislation. In the end, an appeal may depend on whether the Christian Institute, which has been supporting Ashers, can fund the cost of an appeal â and afford the risk of paying Mr Lee's legal costs if they lose again. It may also depend on whether the Supreme Court regards this case as having wider implications, not just for people in Northern Ireland but for the rest of the United Kingdom as well. It is hard to imagine a similar case occurring in any other part of the UK, not just because same-sex marriage is legal in Great Britain but also because it is unusual to find companies operating in the same way as Ashers. There are plenty of shops and restaurants in Great Britain that sell only kosher or halal food but their religiously-observant owners will normally serve any customer who comes through the door. That, after all, is what the law requires.","After the Court of Appeal in Belfast upheld a finding over Ashers Baking Company, the company's manager, Daniel McArthur, told reporters the case was was not about the man who placed the order - Gareth Lee."
"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter It's a row in these heady days where one major player in the bubble promises something, then a rival says something rather different. Then, whoops, fearing a story about splits and dissent within a matter of hours, there is what is officially called a ""clarification"" - in other words one of those involved in the clash eats their words. As we reported last night, before midnight, Labour delegates agreed there would be a compromise to hold out the possibility of having another referendum. It was difficult to decide because the party leadership is conscious of not hacking off millions of Labour voters who want to leave, but also have to try to keep the membership - who, if they had a choice, would probably stop Brexit dead in its tracks tomorrow - happy. That's why there was so much discussion last night over the wording. But by midnight, allies of Keir Starmer and the Labour elements in the campaign for another vote were content. Not only did they have the idea on the agenda, but they had been able to keep the promise vague enough that if the circumstances emerge, there could be another referendum with, crucially, the option of staying in the EU on the ballot. But at 7:30am the shadow chancellor piled in telling the BBC that it was important to ""respect the referendum"", explaining that in his view another public vote should be on the terms of the deal. Was he trying to kill off the idea of another vote on stay or leave? It seemed that way. Then Tom Watson, who had been part of the push to change the policy, didn't quite agree with him. He told me a couple of hours later there was an ""inevitable logic"" to in or out being part of this hypothetical vote. Then Keir Starmer, who was in the room for all of those hours, came striding across the conference plaza to make absolutely clear that deliberately, and explicitly, the agreement in the room was to leave the option of holding another EU referendum on staying in or leaving on the table (in the end). Then lo and behold, perhaps thinking of the headlines his own dramatic speech this afternoon might generate, John McDonnell popped up again, to say that after all, guess what, ""all options"", including a vote, perhaps, one day, to stay in the EU, are after all still on the table. So, as you were. The 360 is complete. Labour is still inching towards the possibility of a second public vote that might include staying in the European Union. But the reluctance of Jeremy Corbyn's close allies seems clear. Conference will vote for the promise of that possibility, but that's a long way from vowing the party would make it happen.",We have just witnessed a classic conference '360'.

"Peter Ball, who is now 85, was jailed for 32 months in October 2015 for offences against 18 teenagers and men. The former Bishop of Lewes and of Gloucester carried out the abuse between the 1970s and 1990s. Ball's identical twin and former bishop Michael Ball said in an email events had ""wearied and reduced us"". In the email, mistakenly sent from Michael Ball to BBC South East's Colin Campbell among others, the brothers said having been ""battered by the Church"" they would be looking to join the Roman Catholic Church. They said they would like to ""end our days in a church where we can live and worship in anonymity and without constant fear"". The BBC contacted Michael Ball about the email and he said a move to the Catholic Church was ""a possibility"". The Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton said in a statement: ""We confirm that Peter Ball has been in contact with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton, in which diocese he now lives, expressing an interest in becoming a member of the Catholic Church. ""This matter is subject to discussions between Clifton Diocese and the statutory authorities, who are the lead with regards to Peter Ball's risk management in the community."" 'Manipulative' campaign An independent review of Ball's case by Dame Moira Gibb criticised the former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey. Dame Moira said he had received seven letters from families and individuals following the arrest and cautioning of Ball in 1992 for gross indecency - when he stood down as Bishop of Gloucester - but failed to pass six of them to the police. Lord Carey had also failed to put Ball on the the ""Lambeth List"" which names clergymen whose suitability for ministry had been questioned. Dame Moira also heard Bishop Michael Ball allowed his brother to attend functions in his place, even after his resignation, and on one occasion Peter Ball had introduced himself as his brother. In 1994 Michael Ball campaigned to Lord Carey to return his brother to the ministry, with one bishop calling the brothers' activities ""manipulative"", Dame Moira reported. Between 1995 and 1997, with Lord Carey's backing. Peter Ball returned to church ministry, eventually undertaking duties such as confirmations. After a series of investigations Balls' ministry ceased in 2011, Dame Moira reported. He was released from jail in February after serving 16 months.","A former bishop jailed for sex offences and his twin brother have said they are looking to join the Catholic Church to ""live and worship in anonymity""."
"The ""pepperpot"" tower in Upton upon Severn still bears the scars of fighting during the Civil War. Simon Smith, from Malvern Hills District Council, climbed the tower with an engineer and found the jackdaw's nest. ""I clambered up as far as I dared and found a great ball of mud that is jamming up the hands,"" he said. The clock had not worked for six weeks but it was not until Tuesday that the cause of the problem was discovered. The jackdaws, which had got into the tower through the clock face, made their nest around the spindle that controls the hands. Mr Smith said the birds would be left undisturbed until their chicks had left the nest in about a month. Bullet holes He said the council would then face the challenge of stopping the jackdaws from getting into the tower again. The tower is all that is left of the medieval St Peter and St Paul Church. Before the Battle of Worcester in 1651 it was the scene of fierce fighting, as Royalist troops tried to prevent Cromwell's army crossing the River Severn. Bullet holes from the fighting can still be seen in the stonework. The tower was originally topped by a steeple but when this became unsafe in 1770 it was replaced with a cupola, which gave rise to the pepperpot nickname. The knave of the church was demolished in 1937, and in 1953 the tower was declared an ancient monument. It now houses the town's heritage centre, and the garden around it contains a memorial to Admiral William Tennant, the man who organised the Dunkirk evacuation in World War II.",A family of jackdaws has stopped the clock in a medieval church tower in Worcestershire.
"Experts cast doubt on the benefit of schemes such as a Â£655,000 a year cooking bus and anti-smoking projects costing thousands. Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar questioned Welsh government funding ""harebrained schemes"". Public Health Wales (PHW) acknowledged it needed to do things differently. Meanwhile, ministers welcomed the review. Experts examined the efficiency and impact of 25 public health projects, which are funded by the Welsh government and PHW. Their report said 10 of these did not appear to have any health benefits and alternatives should be explored. They included a Cooking Bus, which visits schools to promote healthy eating and cooking, and cost Â£655,000 to fund in 2012/13. Other projects identified as bring poor value for money were anti-smoking schemes, such as a smoking helpline, breastfeeding support groups and a scheme to raise awareness about skin cancer. Concerns were also raised about another nine projects - costing more than Â£9m in total over the last year - where the experts said more evidence was needed to see whether they have had any impact. The panel concluded that none of the 25 initiatives should receive extra future funding from the Welsh government. Mr Millar said the public should be concerned about what the Welsh government had been spending public money on. ""You have to question when you look at some of the case studies in this report, particularly the cooking bus, what on earth the business planning process was like in the first place that approved these sorts of schemes?"" he said. ""Every pound really does count and spending millions on harebrained schemes like the cooking bus I think the public will quite rightly question what on earth the Welsh government's been doing with their money."" Dr Patricia Riordan, director of health and healthcare improvement for PHW, said the way money was spent on public health projects needed to change. ""I think it's a concern when you are made aware through the evidence that your resources have not been targeted appropriately and this is what I say - we need now to refocus those resources to programmes that we know deliver the outcomes,"" she said. ""What we are doing today in Public Health Wales is acknowledging that we need to do things differently now. ""It is no longer acceptable to do things the way we did them in the past - we need now to look forward to a whole transformational change."" She added: ""Any programmes of work that we now progress going forward right from the outset will be designed to collect data to determine if we are achieving the health outcomes that we set out to achieve - and they will be consistently monitored as we go forward."" Despite the damning report, the experts did highlight a number of public health initiatives that were working well. These included the National Exercise Referral Scheme, Stop Smoking Wales, and the National Breastfeeding Programme - Baby Friendly Initiative. The Welsh government said it welcomed the ""extensive review"" of public health schemes. ""It is essential in times of restricted budgets that we use every penny wisely and that investment in public health schemes leads to real benefits to people's health,"" a spokesperson said. ""We look forward to receiving PHW's proposals for refocusing initiatives.""","About Â£1.5m of public money was spent in Wales over the last year on 10 projects that were unlikely to bring any health benefits, a report shows."
"The number of mounted units in Britain has fallen from 17 in 2012 to 12 in 2014, amid pressures on budgets. And the study commissioned by the Association of Chief Police Officers set out to assess the value of the patrols. Researchers say they could have a greater role in neighbourhood policing. Interviews with police and the public were conducted by the University of Oxford and research group RAND Europe between February 2013 and August 2014. They examined the reaction of members of the public when neighbourhood patrols by pairs of mounted police officers were trialled in three areas in Gloucestershire and London in March 2014. They also looked at the use of mounted units at the Glastonbury Festival, football matches and demonstrations. 'An ice-breaker' On average, police on horseback were said to have six times as many casual interactions with the public as those on foot patrol. But the study said their value also depended on the character of the rider, with the more personable and outgoing an officer, the better. The report acknowledged the ""unique role"" mounted units had in dealing with crowds and disorder, highlighting situations where police on foot or in vehicles would be ineffective. But it was, it added, difficult to say ""successful outcomes"" at crowd events were solely down to the presence of mounted units. A ""primary benefit"" in using mounted units in neighbourhood policing was attributed to the patrols increasing the visibility of officers. Report co-author Ben Bradford, from the Centre for Criminology at the University of Oxford, said: ""In community settings, the horse and rider combination appears to act as a sort of ambassador and 'ice-breaker' for the police. ""People come up to say 'hello' or to make a fuss of the horse before having a quick conversation with the officer."" He added: ""Many people react positively to greater police visibility in their neighbourhood, and we believe this translated into higher levels of trust and confidence in the areas where the mounted patrols took place."" Acpo's national lead for mounted policing, Deputy Chief Constable Rod Hansen, said the research provided forces with ""new evidence suggesting that mounted units still have great utility in modern policing"". ""Despite the financial limitations, we must ensure that we do not inadvertently lose a capability that offers so much to policing services without fully understanding the consequences,"" he said. The researchers say the drop in mounted units in recent years ""raises a number of questions about both local and national policing capacity"". But they say their report does not set out to recommend how forces spend their budgets or whether they should have mounted units. The British police forces with mounted sections are: Avon and Somerset Constabulary; City of London Police; Greater Manchester Police; Lancashire Constabulary; Merseyside Police; Metropolitan Police; Northumbria Police; Police Scotland; South Wales Police; South Yorkshire Police; Thames Valley Police, and West Yorkshire Police.","Levels of public trust and confidence in police are higher when officers are deployed on horseback, a report suggests."
"By Angie BrownBBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter Several said it would mean the difference between opening or not, and ""wholeheartedly"" welcomed the proposal. Currently businesses must operate under a two-metre rule, but this may be reduced to 1m - with safeguards. Customers can sit in restaurants and bars in Scotland from 15 July. The Scottish government said it would set out guidance at the end of next week on how the the industry could operate. However, it said ""for illustrative purposes and to allow businesses to start to plan"" it would give some guidance in ""general terms"" including plans to let businesses decide to operate at less than 2m as long as they had a warning in their windows. Tom Ponton, owner of the Oz Bar in Edinburgh's Grassmarket, said he ""wholeheartedly"" welcomed the idea. He said: ""This is the difference between me opening and not opening. ""It is the best news for the entertainment industry so far. ""Even at 1m we are going to have to cut the capacity but at 2m it is impossible."" Billy Lowe, who owns The Black Ivy in Bruntsfield and McSorley's in Edinburgh's city centre Forrest Road, said he would put a sign up in his window straight away if the government went ahead with the plan. He said: ""We had been considering not opening because the two-metre rule wouldn't allow us to get the numbers to make it viable. ""So this news is a game changer. ""I also love the sound of the sign because then people know what they are getting when they enter and can't complain. ""I had foreseen conflict between customers with the two-metre rule but if there is a 1m sign outside in the window then that will stop all that."" Daniela Scott, who runs her father's Italian restaurant Gordon's Trattoria on Edinburgh's Royal Mile said she was very relieved the government was now considering the one metre rule. She said: ""This is a game changer in the restaurant trade and makes me feel like we have a bit more of a chance of survival. ""I 100% welcome putting a sign up in the window. ""The one-metre rule means we could have another 10 seats in the restaurant. The thought of it makes me feel relieved."" Mohammed Parvez, 55, owner of the 42-seat Indian restaurant Rannaghor in Edinburgh's Currie area, said he welcomed the news. He said: ""This is what the customers want. They have been calling me asking when they can sit in the restaurant and said they don't want to sit 2m apart. ""Eating in a restaurant is all about the buzz and atmosphere of being out with others and enjoying lovely food, they don't want to be sitting in a sparsely filled place. ""I absolutely welcome this latest development and urge the Scottish government to follow through with this plan."" Steven Hall, general manger of The Dome in Edinburgh said: ""This is a step in the right direction. I would welcome it but we also need to see what the other guidance and regulations will be."" The Scottish government said in its briefing on Thursday: ""For illustrative purposes and to allow businesses to start to plan, we are publishing today the kinds of mitigations that might be required in each sector. ""However in general terms, these might include improved ventilation; Perspex screens; regulation of customer flow and seating plans that reduce transmission risk. ""For hospitality and possibly others, mitigation will also include the collection of names and addresses of customers, to help with contact tracing when that is necessary. ""And we will also insist on clear customer information to help inform the judgments we all make as individuals about the risks we are prepared to take. ""So if a business decides to operate at less than 2m, they should provide clear signage informing their customers that they are entering a one-metre zone. ""We hope to have guidance agreed for the start of phase 3 and ahead of the opening of tourism and hospitality from 15 July.""","Pub and restaurant owners have said the Scottish government's plan to allow businesses to reduce social distancing - with adequate signage - is a ""game changer""."

Now he has collated his favourite images captured in the area around the staithe, or quay as it is sometimes known - an area of wild open marshland popular with walkers, photographers and birdwatchers. It began when he captured a moonlight scene soon after moving from Boston, in Lincolnshire. ""On this particular evening I had my camera with me and seeing the rising moon decided to venture down the lane to see what was there,"" he said.

"By Peter BarnesPolitical analyst, BBC News The prime minister, who has paid tribute to the NHS staff who cared for him, is now recovering at Chequers, and is not expected to return to work for some time. So who else shares power and how are decisions made while the prime minister is ill? Why is Dominic Raab in charge? Mr Raab is the foreign secretary, but he also has the title of first secretary of state - giving him seniority above all other cabinet ministers. So if Mr Johnson did not return to his post, Mr Raab would take over in the first instance. When Mr Johnson was moved into intensive care, Mr Raab said the government would continue to focus ""at the prime minister's direction"" on defeating coronavirus. Why is there no deputy prime minister? The role of deputy prime minister - like that of first secretary of state - is not a permanent position in government. Someone is appointed at the discretion of the prime minister. The last deputy PM was Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg, during the 2010-15 coalition government with the Conservatives. What will Dominic Raab be able to do? Although Mr Raab was first asked to deputise for the PM while he was in intensive care, we know very little about the exact extent of his authority. There are various things only the prime minister can do - but some of these could be taken up by Mr Raab without much trouble. For example, he could make recommendations to the Queen on appointments to the senior judiciary and high-ranking positions in the Church of England. But it's harder to imagine him conducting a reshuffle - even though, formally, it seems he ought to have that power. It would be tricky for him to authorise military action at short notice. Other ministers would most likely have to agree first, but the buck would stop with Mr Raab. Then, there are the letters of last resort the prime minister writes for nuclear submarines, giving commanding officers instructions about what to do in the event of a deadly attack. It's unlikely Mr Raab would have to write them unless Mr Johnson was incapacitated for a long time. What is collective responsibility? When asked if his role let him take decisions, Mr Raab said there was ""total unity"" among his cabinet colleagues and referred to the system of collective responsibility. It means that in practice, any major decisions will probably be taken by Mr Raab in consultation with the cabinet or, where appropriate, senior civil servants. The cabinet is the ultimate decision-making body of government, made up of the most senior ministers including the home secretary, the health secretary and the chancellor of the exchequer. After February's general election, Boris Johnson formed a cabinet of 22 full members - including himself - and four other attending members. So although he's the head of the government and has some individual powers, most important decisions are taken collectively in cabinet. And the principle of ""collective responsibility"" means each cabinet decision is binding for each member - even if they personally disagreed with it. Not all decisions are taken by full cabinet. It's normal for there to be ""cabinet committees"" - smaller groups of ministers focused on specific issues. Are there special coronavirus committees? There are four ""implementation committees"" working on different parts of the response. They're looking at healthcare, the public sector response, economics and business, and the international response. Each is chaired by a cabinet minister and feeding into a daily overarching ""C-19 meeting"" - led in the prime minister's absence by Dominic Raab. What if Boris Johnson formally relinquished control? If Boris Johnson wasn't able to continue as PM, the rules for what should happen next are unclear - a consequence of the UK's unwritten constitution. But we do have some idea of what might happen. The cabinet manual is the closest thing we have to a document which sets out the role of the prime minister. It suggests the cabinet would select a replacement who the Queen would ask to form a government. That could be Mr Raab or another senior MP. The expectation is that he or she would be in place until the Conservative Party appointed a new leader. According to the Institute for Government think tank, prime ministers continue in office unless they resign or die. It adds: ""While political parties usually have the ability to appoint an 'acting leader' if the leader resigns or is incapacitated, there is no formal 'acting prime minister' role. He or she would be prime minister until they chose to resign or if their cabinet forced them out.""","Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had ""all the authority"" he needed to make relevant decisions, as he deputised for Boris Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus."
"There have been 21 physical attacks on Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) staff in the Western Trust area since the start of the year. Ambulance staff have also been verbally abused on 19 occasions in 2017. Shane Devlin, NIAS chief executive, said it was unacceptable that staff should be assaulted or abused. He told BBC Radio Foyle there were a range of measures in place to cut the risks to staff, but ultimately crews were forced into ""environments that cannot be controlled"". ""In many cases people will be under the influence of alcohol or drugs,"" he said. He said the law should always serve as a deterrent. ""Ultimately, if staff are assaulted or abused, as chief executive to the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service, I will always call for a custodial sentence."" Valerie O'Neill was assaulted more than 10 years ago in an incident in Castlederg, Co Tyrone, that she said left her traumatised. ""Afterwards, the impact is awful,"" she said. ""It was just horrible and for months I could not sleep. I did not feel I wanted to go back to work but thankfully that feeling faded. ""It is very sad these incidents are still ongoing, perhaps it is the case that there is no proper deterrent in place,"" she added. Meanwhile Londonderry's district judge Barney McElholm said perpetrators do not ""consider the sentencing guidelines before deciding how hard to punch the paramedic who's treating them"". He said education and improved parenting ""might go further towards curing this problem"". ""One can see that better parenting is a very important issue here and unfortunately where children go wrong, it's where the parenting is not adequate,"" he added.","The number of physical assaults on paramedics in Northern Ireland's north west is at a five-year high, according to ambulance service figures."
"A Lords committee said expecting people to remember the size of the London Eye or where the UK's first curry house was should not take precedent over how to report a crime or call an ambulance. It also called for public citizenship ceremonies to have more ""impact"". Ministers say a review will see if more emphasis can be put on British values. The Lords committee on citizenship and civic engagement said there was ""confusion"" about the purpose of the Life in the UK test, taken by hundreds of thousands of people each year who want to become British citizens. In 2016, 36% of applicants in England failed the 45-minute test - which involves answering 24 questions about British traditions and customs, government, the law and the events that have shaped British history. The cross-party committee said the 180-page Life in the UK manual, on which the test is based and which was last updated in 2013, contained factual errors and inconsistencies - the current version suggesting that the late prime minister Baroness Thatcher was still alive and making no reference to the Supreme Court. 'Massive book' The latest manual contained details such as the size of the London Eye in feet and the location and owner of the UK's first curry house ""which few British citizens would know and few would think it important for aspiring British citizens to know"". In contrast, the committee said it no longer required ""everyday knowledge"" of the NHS and local services. During their inquiry, the peers heard evidence the manual - which has been revised three times since 2005 - was seen by many as intimidating, with one applicant describing it as a ""big massive book I am really scared of"". One of the academics who gave evidence to the inquiry said the process risked becoming a simple memory test of little wider value. In calling for a comprehensive review, the committee said the section on British history should ""concentrate on those parts that played a key role in the development of the shared values of British citizenship"". While the citizenship ceremonies it had witnessed - where people have to swear allegiance to the Monarch and pledge their loyalty to the UK - were impressive, the committee said they lacked impact and more could be made of the social achievements of those successfully granted citizenship. It pointed to comments by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who suggested learning from Canada, where ceremonies are organised by community groups rather than public authorities and Australia, which has a number of events during the year to celebrate citizenship and Australian values. Australia Day The Australia Day holiday on 26 January is the focal point for its celebrations. Last year, 350 ceremonies were held on the day involving 12,000 people, with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull presiding over one event. The report also calls for the cost of the naturalisation process to be cut and for citizenship teaching to be a statutory right in primary and secondary schools, with a dedicated teacher in all secondary schools. Tory peer Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who chairs the committee, said its recommendations would not cost much money but could make a real difference in improving social cohesion. ""The government has not given sufficient focus to establishing long term programmes which build trust and confidence between state and citizen,"" he said. ""Individuals do not learn about the government and political institutions by osmosis. They need to be taught and taught well. The neglect of citizenship education in recent years is to be much regretted."" The government has already said it will consider whether the test can be improved, with greater emphasis on British values and principles and the ""responsibilities and opportunities of living in modern Britain"".","The UK's citizenship test should focus on ""essential"" knowledge demonstrating whether people can be an ""active citizen"" not trivia, a new report says."
"The party said it had received a formal complaint against Patrick Grady and that ""due process"" would now take place. Mr Grady, the MP for Glasgow North since 2015, became his party's chief whip in June 2017. The SNP said it would not be commenting further on the complaint against him. The formal complaint relates to an alleged incident in 2016. A party staff member claims that Mr Grady inappropriately touched him in a London pub. It is the job of a chief whip to ensure their party's MPs vote with its leadership. Analysis by David Wallace Lockhart, BBC Scotland political correspondent This is probably the last thing the first minister needs. With an election looming in Scotland, it's a particularly bad time to have a prominent MP facing allegations like this. There are allegations the party failed to take firm, swift action when earlier concerns were raised about Patrick Grady. Mr Grady has been approached for comment. Some Conservative politicians are claiming there's a ""stench of corruption"" within the SNP. Similar accusations have been levelled at senior party figures in relation to their cooperation with the Holyrood committee investigating the Scottish government's handling of harassment complaints. Nicola Sturgeon, and her party colleagues, would argue that they've assisted the inquiry to the best of their ability. And the SNP is pointing out that an investigation was launched into Patrick Grady as soon as a complaint was made. This, they insist, was the first opportunity for formal processes to begin. But the SNP image has had a difficult few weeks. This most recent development won't help with that.",The SNP's chief whip in the House of Commons has stepped aside while the party investigates a sexual harassment complaint.
"Eight people were killed when Khurum Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed others in Borough Market. Police then shot and killed the men. At a pre-inquest hearing at the Old Bailey on Friday, the court was told samples from all three attackers contained the steroid hormone DHEA. Xavier Thomas, 45, from France and Chrissy Archibald, originally from British Columbia, were both killed on the bridge. Ignacio Echeverria Miralles De Imperial, 39, from Madrid, Sebastien Belanger, 36, from France, Sara Zelenak, 21, from Brisbane, Kirsty Boden, 28, from Loxton in South Australia, James McMullan, 32, from Hackney in London, and Alexandre Pigeard, 26, from Caen, in Normandy were killed in the market. Toxicology reports submitted to the court said the levels of the steroid in their systems were ""above the acceptable physiological range"" and that the substance had been taken ""recently prior to deathâ¦ in a period ranging from several hours to days"". An expert witness is now going to be called to give evidence to the inquest and prepare a report on the implications of the findings. It comes after a pre-inquest hearing into the Westminster Bridge attack - that took place last March - revealed the man who killed five people, Khalid Masood, had taken anabolic steroids before carrying out his attack. Mark Lucraft, the Chief Coroner of England and Wales, began Friday's proceedings by offering his condolences to the victims' relatives, some of whom were in court. Referring to the ""dramatic events"" that happened just three months after the previous terror attack in London, he said: ""Central London and another iconic bridge... was the scene of shocking events that devastated the lives of many. ""I hope the [inquest] will provide answers to the obvious and understandable questions that the families have... and give comfort in such difficult circumstances"". The coroner decided that two separate inquests would be carried out - one to decide on the deaths of the victims and a second one for the attackers. The latter will have a jury present. A jury is mandatory at an inquest if the coroner has reason to believe the death resulted from an act or omission of a police officer. However, another pre-inquest review will take place first - likely to be in either June or July - before the two inquests start fully in 2019. The two hearings are expected to last a total of two months.",The three men who carried out last June's London Bridge terror attack were all found to have had steroids in their systems when they died.
"Nina Ambrose, from Writtle in Essex, usually works at a cosmetics company. Roger Ambrose, 76, moved into a care home in January and she was unable to see him for the first five weeks of the lockdown. Mrs Ambrose, a former Butlins Red Coat, became an activities team volunteer at the home, and said she felt ""so, so lucky"" to have spent time with him. Retired lorry driver Mr Ambrose was diagnosed with Alzheimer's six years ago and his daughter was used to seeing him several times a week. So when she was furloughed at the beginning of April, Mrs Ambrose offered her services to Manor Lodge in Chelmsford, where he lives. She has been visiting the home three or four times a week, helping to organise events and activities. The 49-year-old said she had to take eight exams, including tests for wellbeing, health and safety and hygiene, as well as having a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check, before she could start. Mrs Ambrose, who normally works in culture and communications for Benefit, said: ""I help on a separate unit from my dad and it's been lovely to get to know other residents. ""I end each session by paying him a visit - once I've changed my clothes and shoes - and we are strict about staying at a social distance. ""We'll sing together or sometimes just sit in silence.

"Official figures show just over half of contacts in the region (53%) had been successfully traced up to 4 August. Mayor Andy Burnham said contact tracing was ""critical"" to tackling the virus and the ""system is not doing that"". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it is working closely with local authorities. There has been widespread criticism of the NHS Test and Trace system with claims that it was ""not fast enough"" Mr Burnham said a local approach was required. ""We've got to decide - and decide very quickly - where are we going with this system before we get into the depths of a difficult winter without a vaccine. August is the month to fix this."" The mayor said he wanted a new protocol which would involve the NHS passing on details to local teams and asked for extra resources to support door-to-door tracing. 'Inhumane' New lockdown laws banning residents from visiting people's homes and gardens in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of Yorkshire came into force on 5 August following a spike in cases of Covid-19. The new measures were introduced four days after vulnerable people were encouraged by the government to stop shielding and told they could no longer claim statutory sick pay. Mr Burnham said ending shielding support was ""inhumane"" and was giving ""mixed messages"". ""It cannot be right at a time when you're asking people to observe extra rules, but you're saying it's okay for people who have been shielding to be going to the shops again."" A DHSC spokeswoman said: ""NHS Test and Trace is working, with over 2.6 m people tested and more than 218,000 people prevented from unknowingly spreading the virus. ""Our priority is to curb the spread of this virus and save lives.

"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter Ministers have for months believed it illogical to strike so-called IS in Iraq, but not over the border in Syria where their HQ is. But the Paris attacks have led the PM to conclude ""we have to ask if we are doing everything that we can do, and should do"" to take extremists on alongside our allies. For him, that means making the case for increasing intervention once again. It will come in the form of an unusual personal response from the prime minister to the Foreign Affairs Committee, which set out broad concerns about strikes. But David Cameron is pushing this right back up the agenda after months where the Parliamentary arithmetic was not certain enough for him to risk a humiliating defeat. It still is not. The anti-action position of the Labour leadership makes another vote far from a forgone conclusion. There is deep concern about taking action unless it's part of wider efforts to bring peace to Syria. That's why the prime minister has not committed to holding a vote asking for backing for air strikes yet, but instead is committing to remake the case more firmly and more comprehensively to try once more to persuade MPs. As things stand a vote on strikes might probably sneak through, as many as 50 Labour MPs are interested in supporting action, and some Tory rebels have shifted position. But a ""maybe"" won't be enough for Number 10 to ask the Commons formally again. Today's statement by Mr Cameron is a big step, but only one along the road to a vote, and planes being sent into action in Syrian skies.",It's back - the prospect of the government sending British planes to drop bombs in Syria.
"Kirsty Williams said that such predictions in 2011 were wrong, and the party went on to win five seats. ""The challenges are the same, and the predictions are the same,"" she said. The Lib Dems also backed a call to end parents' rights to remove their children from sex education lessons, at their spring conference in Cardiff. Speaking to BBC Wales political editor Nick Servini, on the Sunday Politics Wales programme, Ms Williams said: ""Obviously these elections are challenging, but they were challenging for us five years ago, when people like your colleagues in the BBC and pollsters said that we would be wiped out. ""We demonstrated, by taking a very strong campaign out onto the streets into communities, and articulating very clearly why Welsh Liberal Democrats needed to be in the assembly, what we would do if we had the opportunity."" Ms Williams said the Lib Dems had then returned a ""small but strong group"" that had ""punched above its weight and has used its influence to do good things"". ""My more nurses bill, for instance, the first part of Europe that will have a law that will say that we'll have safe staff levels on all our hospital wards."" 'Struggling' On the final day of the conference, a motion to end parents' rights to remove their children from sex education lessons was backed by party members. Cardiff West candidate Cadan ap Tomos, who proposed the motion, said the status quo was ""woefully inadequate"". He said he had spent much of his teenage years ""struggling...mainly because at no point during my education was the message hammered home that being anything other than straight was perfectly normal"". Every child in Wales needed access to sex education, he said, in order to tackle issues including domestic violence, sexual health and teenage pregnancy. Some activists argued that the move would conflict with the right to religious freedom, but the motion was approved by the party's conference and could now feature in the party's assembly election manifesto. Earlier, plans to build 20,000 new affordable homes, if the party wins power in May, were outlined. Double ministers' current target, it would increase social housing spending from Â£35m a year to Â£70m. Money saved from scrapping the Labour Welsh government's planned M4 relief road around Newport would be used to fund the scheme, the party said. Party housing spokesman Peter Black said: ""Wales needs a government that will invest in a house building programme so everyone can have a roof over their heads. ""Social housing will be a priority for the Welsh Liberal Democrats. ""We will ensure that there is quality, affordable housing for those who need it."" Labour had an ""almost sneering"" attitude to home ownership and aspiration, he said, repeating a party pledge to introduce a ""rent to buy"" scheme to help people get on the housing ladder. On Saturday, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron called delays to a Â£1bn tidal energy project in Swansea ""shameful"" and urged the party to challenge Labour's ""arrogant sense of entitlement to rule"" in May.","The Liberal Democrats will confound warnings that they could lose all of their AMs in May's assembly election, the party's Welsh leader has insisted."
"They say the deal for an undisclosed sum is part of their regeneration plans for the city centre. The derelict indoor market hall and other vacant units built in the early 1980s will be demolished and used for car parking in the short term. Tenants such as Iceland and Crane's Music Instruments will not be affected. Swansea council said until economic conditions improved, the site would be used as a 160-space car park when it is flattened. Work is expected to start next March. It said in the long term it would work with its development partner Hammerson to include the site - which is next to the Quadrant Shopping Centre and opposite St Mary's Church - in its city centre retail strategy. Council leader Chris Holley said: ""This is a hugely important site in the city centre but it is largely empty and has become detrimental to our overall aim of improving retail in the city centre. ""It's clear that the city centre can't be regenerated without public sector intervention and purchasing this site gives us the opportunity to work with our development partner Hammerson to put in place a plan to redevelop the site and regenerate the city centre."" The council would not disclose what it paid previous owner Threadneedle Estates for the land but said expert external valuation and economic advice was sought. Minister for Housing and Regeneration Huw Lewis said the Welsh government had contributed funds for the deal. ""Swansea is our second largest city, so has a major role to play in promoting Wales both within the UK and further afield, especially with the city's football club now on the world stage,"" he said. ""I hope this latest move to demolish St David's and make way for improved city centre developments will continue to promote the long-term regeneration prospects for Swansea.""",Large parts of Swansea's St David's Shopping Centre are to be demolished as the site has been bought by the city council and Welsh government.
"The animal welfare charity was alerted to the tiny cub by a member of the public. It is thought the cub had been dragged away from her sett by another animal.

Lavender will be weaned at 12 weeks and released in the autumn with other badger cubs in the SSPCA's care. April said: ""When she arrived she was smaller than my hand and weighed just 250g, although she's getting bigger every day.

"The figures were lifted by strong performances from the chemicals and engineering sectors. However, there was a slight quarterly fall in figures for the food and drink sector. On an annual basis, the overall volume of exports from Scotland increased by 0.5%. The Scottish Index of Manufactured Exports showed exports of refined petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical products grew by 4.4% over the previous quarter, while overseas sales by engineering and allied industries rose by 4.7%. Overseas sales for the food and drink sector shrank by 0.2%, largely due to a fall of 0.3% in drink exports. Over the past year, export sales in the non-metallic product category increased by 11.4%, while metals and metal products rose by 20.3% and textiles, clothing and leather by 10.6%. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ""Manufactured exports in Scotland have grown strongly over the last quarter and the past year. ""These figures reinforce the belief that recovery is being felt across most industries, and follows on from recent GDP figures which show that the Scottish economy moved further beyond its pre-recession peak with GDP growing by 0.9% in the second quarter of 2014, which is the same as the UK as a whole."" The figures were also welcomed by the UK government's Scotland Office Minister David Mundell. He said: ""I welcome the news international exports have grown over the quarter and the year. ""It is more good news for Scotland following a record fall in unemployment, a rise in private sector jobs and our economy growing for two years in a row, thanks to this government's policies."" 'Positive indications' The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the latest figures showed Scotland's manufacturing businesses had been competing well in the global marketplace. Chief executive Liz Cameron added: ""This reflects the positive indications which we have been picking up from the sector throughout this year and shows that high levels of confidence are being justified by solid results. ""What these figures do not show is the performance of our services sectors, which account for 36% of our international exports, who also have a positive story to tell about growth in 2014.""","The volume of Scottish manufactured export sales grew by 2.8% during the second quarter of 2014, according to new statistics."

"The five-day sale began on Sunday, with batches of tickets released daily, and closed at 23:00 BST on Thursday. Any tickets which remain unsold - including any from the batch of 70,000 Olympic Park ground tickets - will be put on general release from 23 May. Additional Olympic Park ground tickets will go on sale closer to the start of the Games. BBC News website readers tell us how they tried - unsuccessfully - to get tickets. Dr Polina Bayvel, London I logged in to try to buy tickets at the precise minute they were released. But I failed every time. I tried popular tickets such as swimming and gymnastics. Much time was wasted adding and deleting tickets and going up and up in price, only to receive the message ""the tickets you requested are not available"", even though they were shown on the website against the event. Using the website is a long, laborious and inconvenient process. This was my third go at getting Olympics tickets. It's like an auction. You go for Â£40 tickets, and when they are not available you go for Â£50 tickets, and then Â£60. In the end I just felt disappointed, mainly over the time wasted. Why con people? Or is this an exercise in raising as much money as possible in the search for non-existing tickets? Pat Stearman, Norwich, Norfolk I have tried continuously since Sunday to get tickets. My daughter and I were trying to get three tickets, and this was our second attempt. Athletics was my priority but I realised this was not going to be possible, so then I tried for diving and also triathalon but to no avail. I spent most of Thursday trying for tickets to the Olympic Park but was again unsuccessful. I am very disappointed. I can't understand it. It's a farce! We put in any event, any day, and still we couldn't get tickets. Tom Evans, East London It was a total disaster from the start. When the first sale of tickets went live we had three different family members trying to purchase athletics tickets - it would have been more but tickets had to be purchased with Visa cards which not everyone had. When the second general sales came round my wife and I were on honeymoon in Kenya so unable to apply. Other family members tried again and managed to get basketball and handball tickets. They wanted athletics tickets but none were available and the system kept crashing. As a result of us being away on safari with no internet access we weren't were eligible for the 20,000 tickets which were made available on 11 May. I felt sick with envy when I heard that those 20,000 were purchasing face value tickets for athletics events including the sprint finals. I spent six hours applying again when the other resale opened on Sunday 13 May but again was unsuccessful. This morning I went to a Spanish website that was selling tickets but have again missed out. It would appear now with hindsight we should have got onto foreign websites a lot sooner. Sadly we trusted our system - EPIC FAIL! Living in East London and having been a massive sports fan all my life this should be the ultimate experience for me. I feel bitter about the whole experience and the whole games. As Londoners we are paying extra for the Olympics and I have experienced none of the privileges of being host nation. Although my life will be disrupted no end. I'm still desperately clinging to the hope that we may get tickets. Just two tickets to any athletic events for me and my wife - Is that too much to ask? More of your comments Phil Mathe in Kent writes: Yet again my family are left disappointed. Tried every day, for a variety of price ranges for a variety of sports, sat and waited and guess what, absolutely nothing. I probably could have got tickets if I'd had Â£700 each to spend but we don't. We just wanted four tickets to something, and instead we sit here now with two gutted children and nothing but ill feeling towards the whole process. What a joke. Sue Merifield in Witney, Oxfordshire, says: I am rather disappointed for my kids in particular - unsuccessful in the first round and invited subsequently to try again - but I've looked at so many events and there are only high price tickets left, which for us as a family of four are out of the question. Also, the email I received today was entitled ""You're chance for Olympic tickets"" - shocking to have such an elementary spelling mistake on this! Tony in Nottingham comments: Wanted to buy Olympic Park tickets today but the only sessions coming up were for the first week up to 2 August. No explanation or details of how to buy tickets for later dates. Ade Smith, in Croydon, writes: Still fuming over this priority window just closed. As someone who missed out in the opening lottery I bought an event in the second stage that I wasn't that fussed about - just to get a ticket. If had known that this stopped me from applying in this round I wouldn't have bothered. Ticket sales have been a farce - the process has dampened people's enthusiasm for the Games.",The window allowing people to try again if they previously failed to secure Olympics tickets has closed.
"Shante Turay-Thomas, 18, had a severe reaction to eating a hazelnut. The inquest heard a series of failures meant that an ambulance took more than 40 minutes to arrive at her home in Wood Green, north London. Her mother Emma Turay, who said she felt ""badly let down"" by the NHS, wants an ""allergy tsar"" to be appointed to help prevent similar deaths. The inquest heard call staff for the NHS's 111 non-emergency number failed to appreciate the teenager's worsening condition was typical of a severe allergic reaction to nuts. A telephone recording of the 111 call, made by her mother, at 23:01 BST on Friday 14 September 2018, revealed how the 18-year-old could be heard in the background struggling to breathe. ""My chest hurts, my throat is closing and I feel like I'm going to pass out,"" she said before asking her mother to check how long the ambulance would be, then adding: ""I'm going to die."" 'Very sorry' The inquest heard Ms Turay-Thomas had tried to use her auto-injector adrenaline pen, however it later emerged she had only injected a 300 microgram dose, rather than the 1,000 micrograms needed to stabilise her condition. It also emerged she was unaware of the need to use two shots for the most serious allergic reactions and had not received medical training after changing her medication delivery system from the EpiPen to a new Emerade device. The inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court was told an ambulance that was on its way to the patient had been rerouted because the call was incorrectly categorised as requiring only a category two response, rather than the more serious category one. It eventually arrived more than 40 minutes after she first contacted the 111 service. Ms Turay-Thomas died later in hospital, with a post-mortem examination identifying acute anaphylaxis as the cause of death. Returning a narrative verdict, coroner Mary Hassell said she would have survived had she been given ""appropriately robust training"" about treating her condition and administered the correct dose, and had the 111 call-handler responded correctly to her condition, and had NHS Digital categorised anaphylaxis as requiring a category one response. ""It only remains for me to say I'm so very, very sorry for the loss of such a young girl,"" she added. 'Huge failures' She added she intended to make a prevention of future deaths report highlighting areas of concern. The teenager's mother said: ""Nothing will ever bring our beautiful Shante back to us but what has kept me going throughout this process is knowing that she would want me to get answers and make sure the same thing doesn't happen to anyone else. ""The coroner highlighted the fact that no one person in NHS England or the Department of Health is responsible for allergies, and it is quite clear we need an allergy tsar to co-ordinate and implement steps to prevent others from suffering avoidable deaths like Shante's."" Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, who set up the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation following their own daughter's death from anaphylaxis, said the inquest ""exposed huge systemic failures at all levels of our healthcare system"". Tsars are advisers who help shape government policy in certain areas pertinent to their expertise.","A teenager with a severe nut allergy died in part because of human error, a coroner has ruled."
"By Andy DangerfieldBBC News, London Murder Map's founders Nick Cullen, 27, and Peter Stubley, 33, are plotting this macabre visualisation, which could prove gruesome and grossly insensitive to some, but fascinating and potentially useful to others. The website, which launched in May, uses web application Google Maps to plot more than 400 homicide cases, based on news agency Central News' court reports and the Old Bailey's archives. But charity Victim Support says the tool is insensitive to families of murder victims. ""This website has a gruesome and unnecessary amount of detail,"" a charity spokesperson said. ""It is grossly insensitive to people who have been bereaved in such tragic circumstances."" However, Barry Mizen, whose 16-year-old son Jimmy Mizen bled to death after being attacked in Lee, in south east London, in 2008, said: ""I do not have a problem with the site. ""The facts are public knowledge, so I don't think anyone who disagreed could force the issue. ""Ideally to ask the family would be courteous but victim's families' details are not public knowledge so it would be difficult contacting them to ask for permission,"" he added. 'Callous society' Mr Cullen defended the site, saying: ""We don't want to upset people but want to report cases as accurately as possible. ""You wouldn't have asked a reporter not to report on the 7/7 bombings because it was an important story. ""Equally, it is important that every murder is reported. ""If murders are just forgotten about, it's a sign of a callous society that doesn't care about bloodshed happening in its midst."" Other websites map crime levels by area, which has led some to question whether this new tool is necessary. A spokeswoman for Victim Support said: ""Police and government websites already allow anyone to check local crime levels in a much more appropriate way, so it is hard to see any justification for this site."" But the website's founders, who are not yet making a profit but admit they ""might do so eventually"", believe Murder Map is useful in many ways. ""We're unique in mapping actual court reports, following each case through to sentencing,"" said Mr Cullen. Murder Map's founders say they set up the website because they were ""frustrated to see a lot of murder cases that were not reported in some of the national media"". ""This website redresses the balance with all cases in one place, with equal weight,"" said Mr Cullen. Mr Mizen agrees, saying: ""We all too easily become complacent if homicides do not make the news."" ""So making known every homicide would at least give people the facts."" Street gangs If Murder Map develops to a stage at which decades of homicides are plotted, the website could also provide insight into shifts in crime patterns and its producers think this could influence policy makers. ""We want the site to be useful for lawyers, police and anyone interested in making the city a safer place to live,"" said Mr Cullen. The Metropolitan Police said: ""It is not for us to criticise or endorse the website."" Murder Map's producers say they have not found a similar website for any other city. ""If there was, you could make very interesting comparisons,"" Mr Cullen said. This is not the first time Google Maps has been used to map controversial subject matter. London Street Gangs plots what it claims are the names and territories of more than 100 gangs in the capital. Meanwhile, the Green Party's Jenny Jones thinks the tool could be put to better use. ""Why not map the road deaths in London?"" she asked. ""There are far more than there are murders and they are concentrated in areas with high crime levels."" But for now, Murder Map's producers have their work cut out working through the Old Bailey's astonishing archives to map killings. ""Once that's done, then we might look into other crime,"" Mr Cullen said.","From the butchery of Jack the Ripper to the organised crime of the Krays, an ambitious project is under way to map every London murder case since the 19th Century."
"Kate Bushell, 14, was killed while walking her neighbour's dog. She was found dead with knife wounds to her neck on 15 November 1997 in a field near Exeter by her father. Investigating officers followed 10 possible leads after the 20th anniversary appeal but have not been able to find the killer. Officers say the case, which is Devon and Cornwall Police's biggest ever murder investigation, costing more than Â£1m, will ""always remain open"". More news from Devon and Cornwall Detectives remain convinced that the offender has a local connection due to the location of the crime scene, an isolated rural spot mainly used as a cut-though and by local dog walkers. In June 2017 a group of serving and retired detectives began re-examining key evidence in the hope of finally catching her killer. On the 20th anniversary of her death a new major public appeal was launched for people to come forward with critical and previously withheld information. Within weeks of the new investigation in November more than 200 calls had been received by the investigating officers. Former Det Supt Paul Burgan, of Devon and Cornwall Police, who led the review of the murder investigation, said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the force's highest-profile murder investigation remained unresolved. ""Unfortunately, despite the volume of calls we still do not know who is responsible for Kate's death,"" he said. Kate's older brother Tim appealed to anyone who might be withholding information to speak out. Crimestoppers has offered a Â£10,000 reward for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of the killer.",The murder of a Devon schoolgirl who died in 1997 remains unsolved after all new leads were exhausted following a police appeal last November.
"A Guardian columnist highlighted the security breach on Twitter and the BBC was also able to access private details of people attending the event. The Conservative Party apologised for ""any concern caused"" and said ""the technical issue has been resolved"". The Information Commissioner's Office said it would be making inquiries. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said the technical glitch was ""deeply, deeply embarrassing"" for the party. The Guardian's Dawn Foster, who is attending the conference, tweeted about the security breach and said she had been able to access the former foreign secretary's personal details, including his mobile phone number. She shared a redacted picture of Mr Johnson's profile, which did not reveal his phone number. It appears that people could access an MP's personal details by entering their email address, without a password, when pressing the attendee's button in the app. This button has since been removed on the app, which was created by Australian firm Crowd Comms. Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis said the app was ""now functioning securely"" and the party would be ""investigating the issue further"". On Thursday the Evening Standard reported Mr Lewis was set to ""unveil the first 'interactive' conference app"" on Sunday in a bid to overhaul the Conservatives image, and appealing to the younger voter. Prime Minister Theresa May, who was arriving at the conference in Birmingham, ignored questions from reporters about the security blunder. The Press Association said the details of Environment Secretary Michael Gove had also been shared online. 'A bumpy start to a bumpy conference' By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in Birmingham On the very day Business Secretary Greg Clark expressed concern about Facebook's security breach, the Conservative Party has had to say sorry for its own. This conference hasn't even started yet, but officials are already rattled. One Conservative source described it to me in very colourful, unbroadcastable terms, in a text message he sent me by accident. Was this a breach of national security? No. Was it an unforced error the party could do without, and a bumpy start to what was already likely to be a bumpy conference? Yes. And this may well not be the end of it, with the Information Commissioner's Office now involved. Pictures on Twitter show people apparently changing individuals' profile pictures and leaving messages on the app's internal messaging system. One Twitter user posted a snapshot of Mr Gove's profile picture, which had been changed to a snap of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Mr Gove previously worked as a journalist at The Times, one of Mr Murdoch's papers. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it would be making inquiries about the breach and added that ""organisations have a legal duty to keep personal data safe and secure"". The ICO's statement added under the EU's new GDPR regulation, the Conservative Party has 72 hours to notify the regulator of a personal data breach that ""could pose a risk to people's rights and freedoms"". One of Labour's shadow cabinet, Jon Trickett, criticised the Conservatives for the breach and said: ""How can we trust this Tory government with our country's security when they can't even build a conference app that keeps the data of their members, MPs and others attending safe?"" Labour's grassroots campaign group Momentum said their party's app had been developed by a team of volunteers, adding: ""I'm sure they'd be happy to give the Tories a few tips next year."" The Conservative Party conference is being held in Birmingham and is due to start on Sunday.",Conservative MPs including Boris Johnson have had their phone numbers and other personal details revealed by the party's conference app.
"In June, an inquiry concluded more than 450 patients died after being given ""dangerous"" amounts of painkillers. Three previous investigations by Hampshire Constabulary resulted in no charges being brought. Bridget Devine-Reeves's petition, which collected more than 101,000 signatures, calls for a criminal inquiry. Her grandmother, Elsie Devine, was admitted to the hospital in 1999 while she recovered from a urinary tract infection but died after being given the opioid fentanyl, diamorphine, a sedative called midazolam and an anti-psychotic drug called chlorpromazine. More news from the South of England Ms Devine-Reeves said: ""The reason I started this petition is because we can't wait. ""It has been 20 years since the alarm was first raised by one of the first relatives to the police and it's been 30 years, nearly, since the nurses whistleblew on this regime."" The inquiry by the Gosport Independent Panel said the quality of previous police investigations into 92 of the deaths had been ""consistently poor"". It found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication, which was overseen by Dr Jane Barton. Dr Barton was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. She was not struck off the medical register but chose to retire after the findings. A new police probe is being led by Assistant Chief Constable Nick Downing, head of serious crime at Kent and Essex Police.",A petition calling for justice for people who died at Gosport War Memorial Hospital has been handed in to Downing Street.
"Amjad Bashir said Mr Farage was using UKIP ""as a means for getting power"". Shortly before Mr Bashir announced his defection on Saturday, his former party said he had been suspended over various allegations - all of which he denies. Meanwhile, Labour has released footage of a UKIP official calling the NHS the ""biggest waste of money"" in the UK. Mr Bashir was elected as a UKIP MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber last year, and was also the party's communities spokesman. 'Crude attempt' Formerly a Tory, he became involved with UKIP three years ago, but met David Cameron on Friday to discuss his defection. Mr Cameron said he was ""delighted"" Mr Bashir was rejoining the Tories. But before the defection was announced, UKIP suspended Mr Bashir and said he was being investigated for matters including ""unanswered financial and employment questions"" and ""interference"" with candidate selection processes. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Mr Bashir said his suspension was a ""crude attempt"" to discredit him. ""There is not a shred of truth in any of the claims but it has made me more convinced than ever that I made the right decision,"" he said. He said he had joined UKIP because he wanted a referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, and better controls on immigration. But he said he now had ""no doubt"" that Mr Cameron would deliver this, so UKIP ""has outlived its usefulness"". On Mr Farage, he said: ""He runs the party like a dictator, employs people who are totally inappropriate for party positions and gets rid of anybody who stands in his way."" Mr Bashir also said he had experienced racism within UKIP, and criticised the ""appalling"" behaviour of its MEPs, who ""make childish remarks during debates and are abusive towards MEPs from other countries"". 'Reichstag bunker' In a separate development, Labour has published footage of UKIP's party secretary Matthew Richardson describing the NHS as the ""Reichstag bunker of socialism"". In various clips, which Labour says were filmed at a 2010 conference in the US, Mr Richardson described ""socialised healthcare"" as ""dangerous"" and ""very, very hard to get rid of"". ""The biggest waste of money in the whole United Kingdom is of course the NHS,"" he added. At that time Mr Richardson was executive director of the Young Britons' Foundation, which ""promotes conservatism"" and trains activists, then ""places philosophically sound conservatives in full-time jobs and work experience in the City, the professions, business, the media, academia and politics"". Speaking about the Mr Richardson's comments, Labour's Jon Trickett said: ""Either Nigel Farage supports this or Mr Richardson cannot stay in post. ""Nigel Farage cannot simultaneously defend these comments and claim that his party stands for the NHS free at the point of use."" Mr Trickett said the comments revealed ""UKIP's real agenda on the NHS"", which he said was to ""dismantle its foundations"". A UKIP spokesman said Mr Richardson was being critical of NHS management rather than the institution. Last week Mr Farage said his desire to replace the NHS with an insurance-based system, like that used in many other countries, had been rejected by his party - so UKIP policy remains in favour of a tax-funded NHS, free at the point of use. But Mr Farage told the BBC ""this is a debate that we're all going to have to return to"" as demand for healthcare increased because of Britain's ageing population.","An MEP who defected from UKIP to the Conservatives has branded his old party a ""vanity project"" for its leader Nigel Farage, who runs it ""like a dictator""."
"He said he was ""disappointed and angry"" about the allegations, broadcast by Channel 4 News. Lord Rennard said he knew of no complaints against him in his 27 years working for the Lib Dems. But he has temporarily stood aside from the Lib Dems in the Lords to avoid ""embarrassment"" to the party. The Lib Dems have launched a review of how it handles allegations of harassment. 'Attempt to damage' On Thursday, Channel 4 News aired allegations by a number of women of sexual impropriety over several years by Lord Rennard, the party's former chief executive, The women told the news programme he abused his position for years by inappropriately touching and propositioning them Allegations from two more women were broadcast on Friday. The latest statement issued on behalf of Lord Rennard, who has been overseeing elections in Armenia, said: ""I absolutely deny any suggestion of improper touching, nor did I invite a woman to join me in my room. ""I note that these alleged instances supposedly took place in public bars with other people present. I am disappointed and angry that anonymous accusations from several years ago are once again being made public in this manner in a clear attempt to damage my reputation. Let me reiterate that in 27 years working for the Liberal Democrat Party, not a single personal complaint was ever made against me to my knowledge."" Immediate review The original Channel 4 report alleged that some of the women had reported the allegations to figures in the party but it was not taken any further or their claims were not taken seriously. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has asked party president Tim Farron to conduct an immediate review into the party's procedures for dealing with allegations of harassment, including an examination of how allegations made in the past have been handled. A spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ""The first he knew of the allegations in the report was after the party was contacted by Channel 4."" A Lib Dem statement later said the newly-formed review group had already had its first meeting. An internal investigation into the specific allegations raised by Channel 4 News has also begun under the party's disciplinary procedures, it said. ""There are a number of questions that have been raised and our reviews will ensure we properly address all of them,"" the party said. ""We will not tolerate harassment in our party and we urge anyone to contact the chief executive or use our confidential whistle-blower procedure if they have issues they wish to raise as a result of Channel 4's report.""",Senior Liberal Democrat peer Lord Rennard has issued a further statement denying allegations by women party workers of sexual impropriety.
"By Jennifer MeierhansBBC News Online ""When my baby was born she was poorly in a neonatal intensive care unit,"" said Hannah Wort. ""A nurse said, 'whenever we touch her she opens her eyes and likes to keep tabs on what's going on'."" ""My partner and I both looked at each other and just said, 'Tabitha!'"" The now happy and healthy two-year-old shares a name with a biblical disciple who rose from the dead, said Mrs Wort, from Caterham, Surrey. ""This is massively relevant as well, as we were told that she was not going to survive and had to be resuscitated a few times,"" she said. ""It all just ties in perfectly. Definitely the right name for her."" Do we judge people by their name?

Mr Ottey says he is yet to meet another Hezron. His 11-year-old daughter is called Keanna as he wanted to choose something unusual. ""In secondary school having an old fashioned name was very uncool,"" said Mabel Barclay, a 23-year-old student from Devon, who lives in Lancashire. ""I stuck out like a sore thumb in a comprehensive school of more than 2,000 students all called Sarah or Emma, when I just wanted to fit in. ""Due to the dog on Blue Peter being called Mabel and Auntie Mabel on Come Outside, I was mocked. ""Some people still ask if I like knitting today and some laugh when they meet me first time, expecting an old lady. ""People from the older generations often comment on it because they have relatives with the name. It's now a great conversation starter and I get to hear lots of lovely stories about people's families. ""I think the name suits me more now because I've become a little traditional with my interests as I've matured. It turns out I do enjoy wool crafts.

""We have Oskar Jakub, Oliwier John, Oktavio Jacek and Oxli Jan. ""I'm Welsh and my wife is Polish and we decided to try and choose names which worked in both cultures.

""We have seen several vehicles, caravans and motorhomes completely burnt out as a result of these fires. ""More recently, the fire has spread to a house and endangered people's lives,"" he said. A caravan owned by Julie Broomfield and Steve Boyd was set alight outside their home in Bitterne. ""Fortunately no-one was injured,"" said Mr Boyd. ""It could have easily killed somebody.""

Officers have also warned people to remove gas canisters and any other potentially flammable materials.","Thirteen arson attacks which have mainly targeted cars, caravans and motorhomes in Southampton are being linked by police."
"By Daniel BennettBBC Scotland The attack brought home the reality of war to one of the remotest part of the country. The bombing, just weeks into the war, was recorded in a curious set of photographs - but therein lies a mystery. The bombers were targeting vessels docked in Sullom Voe - two cruisers, HMS Cardiff and HMS Coventry, a number of cargo ships, and nine flying boats. Local historian and blogger Richard Ashbee said the raid appears to have been based on some preliminary reconnaissance the previous week. ""They (Germany) might have thought Shetland was going to be a base long-term,"" says Mr Ashbee. But the impact on Shetland was ""nil ... less than negligible"" according to curator of Shetland Museum and Archives Dr Ian Tait. That was because not one bomb hit its target. 'Curiously intact' A number fell into the sea and peat land, with one ""almost hitting a school"", according to Mr Ashbee. But the four that fell on rocky ground seemed to claim a victim - a rabbit. There appears to be photographic evidence of this - a man holding the unfortunate animal inside the crater - but not everyone is convinced. ""The rabbit in the photo is curiously intact,"" observes Dr Tait. ""The fact is a rabbit was killed in the attack, but was eaten. Some people claim this rabbit (in the photo) is a prop - that's an over-rectification of history."" So how did this photo come to be taken and is there any truth in the story that a rabbit was killed? Dr Tait explains: ""The rabbit in the photo isn't the one the bomb killed."" Robbie Williamson, a photographer from Lerwick, had a keen eye for a shot. When he heard about the rabbit's death, he went to record the ""historic bombing"" for the purposes of a postcard. But his camera wasn't the only gear he brought. ""He had a good eye for something that would sell. But before going north he went to a butcher's shop to buy a rabbit,"" explains Dr Tait. Recreating the incident, Williamson asked his driver to stand in the crater, holding up the rabbit, ""immortalising the event"". ""Over the years, it became accepted this was the rabbit the bomb killed."" Run Rabbit Run This wasn't the only time Robbie Williamson was to demonstrate his talent for reimagining Shetland's war history. Some weeks later he photographed the aftermath of a further bombing in Shetland - and drew in the aircraft that supposedly dropped the bombs. The rabbit incident also triggered another intriguing myth surrounding the bombing of Sullom. At the time ""Run Rabbit Run"" was a popular song, recorded and performed by comedy double-act Bud Flanagan and Chesney Allen. ""Part of the mythology, fuelled by Williamson's photo, is that this is the rabbit the song was written about,"" explains Dr Tait. But this can't be the case - the song was part of a London stage act performed at the start of October 1939, a month before the bombing. ""What the Sullom rabbit's death ensured was the instantaneous popularity of the song,"" said Dr Tait. ""There were spin-off versions made with alternative lyrics but it wasn't written about that rabbit - the rabbit popularised the song."" Vulnerable island Recreated photos and popular songs aside, what long-term effects did the bombing have on Shetland? For Shetlanders, he thinks the attack must have been a shock. ""They would have felt far from the main centre of population and industry,"" he says. But the attack may have also alerted authorities to the risks of basing vessels in Shetland. ""It's my interpretation, but I daresay that for the War Office, it exposed the fact that Shetland was vulnerable."" It's a notion historian Richard Ashbee agrees with. ""Shetland has a massive coastline - it could have easily been invaded and nobody would have known until it was too late."" As the war progressed, more and more troops and vessels were stationed across Shetland, particularly when Nazi Germany invaded Shetland's eastern neighbour, Norway. The population of the islands ""more than doubled"" as troops were stationed from Sumburgh to Unst. ""Shetland was invaded, but by friendly troops,"" he adds.","On 13 November 1939, the first German bombs to fall on British soil exploded at Sullom in Shetland."
"Facemasks should also be used ""for the entirety of their journey"", in line with new government guidance. On Sunday Boris Johnson said people ""should be actively encouraged to go to work"" from Wednesday, if they cannot work from home. TfL said services would only be able to carry 13-15% of the normal passenger numbers, to maintain social distancing. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he ""expects anyone travelling on a TfL service to wear a non-medical cloth covering their nose and mouth for the entirety of their journey"". The guidance issued by TfL calls on commuters to ""reimagine"" their journeys as ""significant changes"" are required for the way commuters travel. People are advised to ""work from home if possible"" and if they need to travel, ""to think about the times, routes and ways"". Facial coverings should be used when travelling, particularly ""where social distancing is hard to maintain"", TfL said. From today front line transport workers will be offered basic face masks, TfL said. Analysis By Tom Edwards, BBC London Transport Correspondent Transport bosses are grappling with social distancing and how they'll be able to provide a service. The challenge is far, far greater than shifting travel behaviour during the Olympics. New queuing systems will be introduced to limit numbers. They are putting in more temporary cycle lanes and wider pavements, as they also want people to walk and cycle. But the unions say if social distancing can't be implemented the Tube should be shut. Questions are being asked as to why it took so long for this recommendation on face masks to be made. What has changed? TfL warned that while it planned to increase the number of buses and Tube trains running, the services ""will only be able to carry around 13-15% of the normal number of passengers"" to maintain social distancing. Journeys on the Tube were up 10% earlier compared to the previous Monday, according to the mayor of London. Father Grant Ciccone said: ""The use of masks will have to be enforced by the government before travel on the public Tube system and buses can be encouraged."" Some commuters said they were ""dreading"" using the Tube again. Carys Barton has been driving into work at Imperial College NHS Trust during the lockdown and said she was worried about being ""forced back into public transport again"" if the roads became too busy. ""I can see us putting ourselves at further risk to soon if we are all packed in like sardines on that Tube again."" How difficult is it to get London back to work? Analysis by Daniel Wainwright The Prime Minister has said people should avoid public transport ""if at all possible"". For more than two thirds of commuters in Great Britain, driving to work is the norm anyway. However, in London commuters are far more reliant on bus and rail services, according to figures from the Department for Transport. In 2018 nearly six out of 10 workers in London used public transport, including buses, trains and the Tube, while in most other regions it was only about one in 10. People in London and the south of England were also the most likely to be able to work from home. Analysis of the Annual Population Survey by the Office for National Statistics showed about a third of people in London and the south of England had ever worked at home compared to just a fifth of people in the North East. However, before the coronavirus outbreak, working from home all the time was something only about one in 20 Londoners (5.5%) did. Construction worker Peter Osu said he felt he was ""putting my family at risk"" returning to work for the first time since the lockdown started. He said: ""People were sitting close together on the Jubilee Line and others were having to stand. ""There was no two-metre spacing. This is the first day, can you imagine what it's going to look like by the end of the week?"" Commuter Gerry Tiernan, head of production in the costume department at English National Ballet, said she was ""worried"" about increased passenger numbers. She said: ""It's going to be pure luck as to whether you get [Covid-19] or not.""","London commuters should avoid peak times and ""walk and cycle where possible"" transport bosses have said."
"The event in Cromer, organised by North Norfolk Beach Runners, has raised more than Â£75,000 for local good causes since it started in 1985.

"Festival-goers have been known to take wheelbarrows and trolleys of alcohol on to the site at Worthy Farm in Somerset. Ticket-holders for this month's event got an email warning them not to bring alcohol in a ""wheeled device"". In a message later on the event website Mr Eavis sought to clarify the policy by saying trolleys would be allowed but drink should be for personal use. 'Mixed messages' The message on the Glastonbury website posted on Thursday came after some ticket-holders who received the email took to social network sites to express concerns their enjoyment of the event would be affected. It read: ""In reference to the email about alcohol that went out to Glastonbury 2013 ticket-holders this morning, my personal preference is for people that come to our festival to drink much less! ""However, Glastonbury remains the only major festival that allows people to bring their own alcohol in, and you are still OK to bring your own alcohol through the gates, providing it's just for your own use (whether it's on a trolley or not).""

""Any alcohol which is brought to the gates using a wheeled device will not be allowed in, and may be confiscated."" It added that no glass bottles would be allowed on site and all alcohol ""must be for personal consumption only"".

"It follows what the association describes as an ""unprecedented"" rise in violence and suicides in prisons. The association's members voted unanimously for a public inquiry at the body's annual conference in Derby. Justice Secretary Elizabeth Truss last week promised an extra Â£14m to recruit more prison officers. 'Brutal environment' The association, which represents 1,021 governors across the UK, said that in the 12 months to June there were 105 self-inflicted deaths - almost double the number five years ago. Serious assaults on staff have increased by 146% in the same period and self-harm incidents increased by more than 10,000, it added. BBC Home Affairs Correspondent Danny Shaw said the call for a public inquiry was a symbolic gesture by an organisation that didn't usually bang the drum. It was a sign of the alarm felt among governors about safety in prisons, he said. The association said levels of safety in prisons had declined since the introduction of ""benchmarking"" - a programme to drive down costs by reducing staffing and simplifying the prison regime. It said it had a number of questions, including ""why resources continued to be depleted when evidence showed that it was not working"". The purpose of requesting a public inquiry was ""not about apportioning blame but understanding what went wrong,"" it said. The association added: ""Unless we understand what has contributed to the creation of this brutal environment that staff and prisoners are working and living in it is likely to continue. ""The PGA believes an independent public inquiry is the only way we will get to the truth."" Changes due A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the justice secretary had been clear that safety in prisons was fundamental to the justice system working and to its reform. ""We are fully committed to addressing the significant increase in violence, self-harm and self-inflicted deaths in our prisons,"" they said.

"By Stephen RobbBBC News They said things like ""#childhoodgone""; ""#howcouldthey""; ""#blueblues""; ""#ivebeendreadingthisday""; ""#aww""; ""#childhoodmemories""; ""#RIPBluePeter"". Some of this nostalgia and regret stemmed from a mistaken belief that Blue Peter was to be axed altogether, when in fact it will move along with the rest of the BBC's children's offering to the dedicated CBBC and CBeebies channels. A tweet from the BBC's head of press & media relations, Julian Payne - saying: ""For absolute clarity the BBC is not ditching Blue Peter"" - struggled to slow Twitter's rumour mill. Meanwhile, Digital Spy website polled its readers with the question: ""Is the BBC right to axe Blue Peter and other kids' shows from BBC One and BBC Two?"" While a majority of about 55% of respondents accepted, ""Yes - there's nothing wrong with popping kids' shows on a children's channel,"" some 45% still felt, ""No - Blue Peter is an iconic programme that deserves to be on a major channel."" The BBC points out that the numbers watching children's programmes on the terrestrial channels occasionally drop as low as 1,000 nowadays, while audiences on CBBC and CBeebies have increased steadily since the digital channels' introduction in 2002. And after the last analogue transmitters are switched off in October, it removes the requirement to maintain access to particular programmes by keeping them on the two main channels. 'Multi-channel generation' ""It would appear the ratings justify the move,"" says Andy Crane, who started his presenting career alongside Edd the Duck in the Children's BBC ""broom cupboard"" - on BBC One of course - in 1987. ""Kids know where their programmes are. Their fingers fly around the remote control at startling speed,"" he says. ""It's just an acknowledgement that that particular generation are the first completely multi-channel generation. The audience won't notice at all."" How many of those people apparently deeply exercised at the development would ever have noticed without the accompanying news coverage is open to speculation, but it seems safe to assume a great many haven't sat down and watched Blue Peter in years. ""There is no real argument for keeping it on a generalist channel like BBC One,"" says Dr David Oswell, reader in sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London, and author of the book Televison, Childhood and the Home. ""Most children, even from an early age, have the skills and the confidence to flick through the channels, and recognise which channels serve their interests. ""It's in some ways irrelevant to their viewing whether BBC One has children's TV or not."" 'Watch without mother' But Sara Broad, lecturer in English and education at the University of Reading, disagrees: ""Sadly, the downgrading of programmes like Blue Peter and Newsround, to the digital channels CBBC and CBeebies, sends out the message that children's television requires less and less consideration."" She fears the increasing dominance of American imports on digital channels generally, and that the BBC's decision only increases the likelihood young viewers ""will be lost in a cycle of cartoons and US high school sitcoms"". ""Many US programmes are written as pure product placement, while some of the BBC children's television of the past was groundbreaking in helping children ask questions about science, literature, nature and current affairs. ""I only hope that today's decision does not pave the way for a generation that loses a sense of cultural identity and who do not reflect on their viewing choices."" Dr Oswell also dismisses the argument that, because children's programmes can no longer be followed by shows aimed at all ages, viewing as a family will be reduced. The ""watch with mother"" idea has always been ""fairly mythic"", he believes. But former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan feels strongly that losing a show with its history and philosophy from the mainstream of the BBC is ""wrong-headed thinking"". Duncan, who was the Scout Association's chief scout from 2004-09, believes the decision is symptomatic of a general marginalisation of young people and their interests. ""It's not recognising the importance of young people in society,"" he says. ""Separating them from the rest of society is wrong - we should be making young people feel they are more important, not just in their own world."" Citing the example of another legendary BBC children's show that was thought moribund before being reinvented to international success, Duncan wonders whether Blue Peter too could have had a Doctor Who-style revamp. ""Blue Peter is so iconic, I would go in the opposite direction,"" he says. ""I would make it into something that is a bit more exciting and bigger. ""I would put it at prime-time and put more resources into it and make it something very special - because it has the history."" Announcing the decision as part of the corporation's Delivering Quality First cost-saving plans, the BBC Trust was quick to point out: ""Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere."" This, more than where programmes are found by a generation of viewers ""quite happy flicking through the channels"", is the all-important issue, says Dr Oswell. ""As long as the BBC continues to invest properly in children's programmes, and to market those programmes properly, that's what really counts.""","The mood of many at the news the BBC is to move its children's programmes, including Blue Peter, off BBC One and Two, was summed up - in thoroughly modern fashion - in the hashtags on Twitter."
"By Steffan MessengerBBC News Occupational therapy and physiotherapy organisations told BBC Wales a national strategy for rehab would be required. They claim provision is ""patchy"" and without help people's lives will be harmed. The Welsh Government said it had announced an extra Â£10m to help people recovering from coronavirus. Making sure effective support is in place will be key, according to Dai Davies, from the Royal College of Occupational Therapists in Wales. He said coronavirus patients were experiencing extreme weakness and fatigue, breathlessness, neurological problems such as poor concentration as well as anxiety, depression and loss of confidence in their bodies. The effects could last for months, he warned, with occupational therapists (OTs) involved ""from the start"". Mr Davies said: ""It's hard when you've gone from a fully functioning member of society to struggling to get dressed, so that's another major issue our OTs are working on."" As well as helping hospital patients he predicted staff would be attending to many of the 80,000 vulnerable people ""shielding"" at home in Wales. ""We really need the services to be there to meet the needs of those people,"" Mr Davies said. ""Rehab is going to be massive for us in the future."" He said he wanted all UK governments to ensure rehab was central to their health and social care models, with ""multidisciplinary teams"" of therapists in the community. Calum Higgins, of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said the crisis should lead to an NHS culture change so rehabilitation was considered a patient's right. ""This will save both money and time for the health service,"" Mr Higgins said. ""Experience shows that if you don't offer appropriate rehab what happens is that people eventually end up coming back in a worse condition."" A Welsh Government spokesman said it anticipated ""increasing demand"" for rehab from people recovering from coronavirus. ""The health minister has announced an extra Â£10m to support people recovering from coronavirus, including enhanced home care packages,"" a spokesman said. Staff 'couldn't do enough' Edna Unsworth, 88, was discharged from hospital after recovering from Covid-19. She said staff at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire ""couldn't do enough"" for her. Ms Unsworth, from Rhyl, was handed a self-isolation pack of food, toiletries and activities to help with mental health and daily routines. ""When they do go home from hospital it's going to be quite a worrying time for them and their families and we just felt that a bit of support with the packs and tips would give them that confidence and reassurance,"" explained Alana MacPherson, the occupational therapist behind the idea. Jamy Ashton, an occupational therapy chief at the Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said there would be a ""huge role"" for staff responding to coronavirus. ""To come in with a new diagnosis, a scary diagnosis and to have your friends and family not to be able to be in with you, makes it all the more challenging,"" she said. ""We've done a lot of support work, a lot of counselling and working closely with patients on their goals with them to get them back home again."" Independence The occupational therapist in charge of Ms Unsworth's rehabilitation in hospital, Lindsey Macintyre, has been redeployed from working in the community with young people. She said: ""Even when they lift the lockdown there'll be all the people who've been self-isolating, all the elderly people, who've become deconditioned at home, patients who would usually have come into hospital but haven't, and we'll have to try to rehabilitate them back to their usual independence."" Back home, Ms Unsworth will be visited twice a day by technical instructor Beth Jones. ""It's pretty unusual for the acute team to go out of hospital and do this but I'm sure everyone will agree we're more than happy to do it,"" she said. Ms Unsworth said she was happy to be home and couldn't wait to ""look out at the blue sky and the sun and get better.""","Providing ongoing support to patients recovering from Covid-19 will be a ""massive"" challenge for the NHS, say specialists."
"The former home secretary was appointed to the role by Boris Johnson when he became prime minister in July. He was in the role for just six months - making him the shortest serving chancellor since Iain Macleod, who died shortly after taking office in 1970, according to the Institute for Government. Mr Javid quit just under a month before he was set to deliver his first Budget, with November's Budget cancelled because of the snap election. The MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 was born in Rochdale, one of five sons of parents who had moved to the UK from Pakistan. Mr Javid, a 50-year-old father of four, told the Evening Standard in 2012: ""My dad was from a tiny village in Pakistan and came here when he was 17 to look for work. ""He settled in Rochdale and became a cotton-mill worker for Courtaulds. But he was quite ambitious, and saw that bus drivers were better paid. His nickname was Mr Night and Day because he used to work every hour God sent his way."" Mr Javid's father's job was the same as the dad of another high-profile politician, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, and he congratulated the Labour politician ""from one son of a Pakistani bus driver to another"" after his City Hall victory in 2016. Mr Javid spent his school years in Bristol after his parents took over a ladieswear shop there, with the family living in a two-bed flat above it. He told the Daily Mail in 2014 that the school was tough and ""I was naughty, more interested in watching Grange Hill than homework."" But, he said, things changed when his dad read the riot act. ""He said 'this is what I went through, don't let me down'. I felt really bad. My academic work rocketed."" He said that his school did not want to pay for him to do maths O-Level - his dad ended paying for it instead. He had also developed an interest in financial markets, sparked by the Thatcher government's privatisations. At the age of 14 he went to see his father's bank manager and arranged to borrow Â£500 to invest in shares, becoming a regular reader of the Financial Times. His goal became to work in the City so he passed that maths O-Level and, rejecting his school's suggestion he become a TV repair man, headed off to sixth form college and then to Exeter University to study economics and politics - giving a clear hint of his future career direction. He also met his future wife, Laura, while doing a summer job at Commercial Union. They sat opposite each other and shared a stapler, he told the Daily Mail. Their four children are privately educated: ""We do what's best for them,"" Mr Javid, who has described himself as a non-practising Muslim, told the newspaper. After university, he set his sights on a job in the City. As he told the Standard: ""Some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations. ""They often tell you that unless you wear an old school tie or have the family contacts, you just won't get a chance to work in the City. But they were wrong."" His career move worked out well, although he had to move across the Atlantic to succeed. And by the age of 25, he had become a vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank, later moving to Singapore for a period with Deutsche Bank. He rose to become a managing director before leaving in the summer of 2009 to concentrate on a political career. A Conservative Party supporter from the early 1980s he had attended his first conference towards the end of the Thatcher years, with Conservative friends from university such as fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon. They got into a bit of trouble at the 1990 conference, handing out leaflets against the then prime minister's decision to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, opposing the policy despite being diehard fans of Mrs Thatcher's. According to a ConservativeHome profile, Mr Javid, Mr Halfon, another future Tory MP David Burrowes and Tim Montgomerie - founder of ConservativeHome - got up at 7am so they could get front row seats for what turned out to be Mrs Thatcher's final party conference speech. Two decades on and, in 2010, he was elected for the first time, and made swift progress. He began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury, before becoming the first cabinet minister of Asian descent when he was appointed culture, media and sport secretary in 2014. He did that for a year before moving to business secretary for a year and then moving on to be communities and local government secretary. Long thought of as a Eurosceptic, it was a surprise to many when Mr Javid came out for Remain during the UK's 2016 referendum on whether or not to stay in the European Union. That meant, of course, that like then Home Secretary Theresa May and his one-time mentor, then Chancellor George Osborne, he was on the losing side. There was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader after the referendum, on a ""joint ticket"" with Stephen Crabb. (He would have been chancellor to Mr Crabb's prime minister.) He also ran in the 2019 leadership election but was eliminated in the fourth round. Mr Javid was appointed home secretary in April 2018, following the resignation of Amber Rudd during the fallout from the Windrush scandal. The controversy began when it emerged people who moved to the UK legally from the Commonwealth before 1973 were being wrongly treated as illegal immigrants. At the time, Mr Javid told the Sunday Telegraph the scandal ""immediately impacted him"". Mr Javid, who was the first home secretary from an ethnic minority, told the newspaper: ""When I heard about the Windrush issue, I thought that could be my mum, it could be my dad, it could be my uncle, it could be me."" In 2019 he took a hardline stance towards Shamima Begum, who left London to join the Islamic State group aged 15, revoking her British citizenship when she asked to return. The move boosted his popularity amongst some Tories but provoked criticism from others - particularly after her newborn son died in a Syrian refugee camp. In his cabinet roles he had avoided major calamity, although he faced questions as business secretary over Tata steel, and as communities secretary over the government response to the Grenfell disaster. However, he had not been afraid to ruffle feathers, with uncompromising messages to some in the business community and local government. And his resignation followed rumours of tensions between Mr Javid and the prime minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings.",Sajid Javid has resigned as chancellor after refusing a demand to fire his team of aides.
"Jane and Alex Askew's sons James and Freddie were born prematurely at 30 weeks at Ipswich Hospital. James was looked after at Colchester Hospital but Freddie needed specialist care at Addenbrooke's in Cambridge. Staff were able to send pictures of James to his parents with a new app, used by the NHS during lockdown when hospital visits were restricted. East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust (ESNEFT) introduced the vCreate service as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, to securely share messages with families who were unable to be in hospital with their babies. James weighed 3lbs (1.4kg) and his brother Freddie just 2lb 1oz (936g) when they were born by Caesarean section on 26 March at Ipswich Hospital - three days after the national coronavirus lockdown was announced. They were both transferred back to Colchester Hospital's neonatal unit but Freddie needed treatment for a bowel problem at Addenbrooke's for two weeks. 'Added reassurance' Mrs Askew said it was a ""tough time"" for her and her husband as first-time parents but the pictures helped. She said: ""The nurses would send photos overnight and, although you know they would ring if something was wrong, it's the added reassurance you get and it's lovely to see a photo. Our family and friends enjoyed seeing them too. ""It was particularly good for us because there were a couple of days where we didn't see either of them, so getting to see the photos of James and the updates was really nice. Both babies have since been discharged from hospital and are doing well at home in Colchester.",The parents of twin boys treated in hospitals 60 miles (97km) apart thanked staff for sending them video updates.
"It will provide support and training for around 8,000 young people both at schools and outreach projects. Welsh Government ministers say it will improve job prospects and career opportunities for the youngsters. It is being run in the Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil and Torfaen council areas. Similar schemes have run in other parts of Wales. As of the end of June 2010, 11.3% of 16 to 18-year-olds in Wales were classed as NEETs (Not in Education, Employment or Training). Deputy minister for European programmes, Alun Davies, said Pre-VENT 14-19 was backed by Â£8m from the European Social Fund. He said it would tackle the underlying reasons why youngsters find it difficult to learn and were at risk of leaving school without qualifications or skills to find a job. ""We want to break down the barriers that prevent some young people from gaining the most of their education, and this project seeks to address the issue with the aim of reducing the number of young people becoming NEET,"" he said. ""Equipping young people with new skills and confidence will lead to improved career opportunities and a quality workforce."" Youngsters will be offered alternative curricula, vocational training, one-to-one support and activities to raise self-esteem. Pre-VENT will also assist those who are not attending school or college by supporting them back into education. It will also work with pupil referral units, youngsters leaving care and young offenders. Bridgend's cabinet member for young people Alana Davies said: ""We need to ensure we are reaching young people of all abilities. ""Being open and flexible about the routes to learning, training and employment helps us to do this.""",A Â£13m project is being launched to reduce the number of 14 to 19-year-olds dropping out of school or further education in parts of south Wales.
"An objection to Yellow Belly, brewed by Derbyshire-based Buxton Brewery and Sweden's Omnipollo, was raised by Batemans Brewery earlier this year. The Lincolnshire brewery said the name of the imperial stout was too similar to its Yella Belly Gold. Buxton and Omnipollo said they took the decision after ""lengthy"" discussions - but Batemans denied it was contacted. The firms said they spoke to Batemans over the telephone about the dispute, ""but it was immediately apparent that there was absolutely no room for manoeuvre"". 'Nothing back' Stuart Bateman said he had wanted to resolve the situation ""amicably"" but denied any negotiations had taken place. ""We've sent a a pile of correspondence asking to talk about this but we've had nothing back,"" he said. ""Just a few minutes on the phone might have been enough but we have had no contact - I really don't know what else we could have done."" Mr Bateman said an online backlash in the wake of the dispute was completely unjustified. Buxton and Omnipollo said the two products were ""distinct and entirely different in every conceivable manner"". ""Yellow Belly has been brewed annually since 2014 without any apparent confusion arising among the public about who was brewing the beer,"" they said. The breweries have an agreement with Sapsucker Farms Yellow Belly Cidery in Minnesota to allow it to continue using the name Yellow Belly in the US. With the number of breweries globally topping 22,000, Buxton and Omnipollo said creating ""truly unique and distinct"" beer is becoming more difficult, adding that protecting and honouring intellectual property ""is something that all producers have a responsibility to do"".

"Costs have increased by Â£165m, where education and social services are the biggest drivers. But income levels have fallen by Â£160m, with drops in leisure and cultural services causing the biggest impact. Auditor general Adrian Crompton said the financial costs of the pandemic were ""unprecedented in modern times"". In May, the body representing Welsh councils said it would take a generation for them to pay for the pandemic. In its report Audit Wales said an additional Â£500m of Welsh Government funding had mitigated the costs. But auditors said there may still be a ""significant funding shortfall"" for the rest of the financial year ""depending on the future course of the pandemic"". In the report, looking at the financial sustainability of councils as a result of Covid-19, Audit Wales says the ""sustainability of some services may be under threat with particular pressures likely to be felt in areas such as leisure services and the social care sector."" In the short to medium term, the report says it is likely that: The report states that ""some councils were much better placed than others to weather a financial challenge such as the pandemic"". It looks at levels of usable revenue reserves, held by councils as an insurance policy, as an indicator of a council's financial sustainability. In total, the financial reserves of Welsh councils increased from Â£1.09bn in 2019 to Â£1.18bn in 2020, but eight local authorities saw a decrease in their reserves. At 5%, Conwy Council had the lowest percentage of reserves relative to the net cost of its services. Flintshire was on 8%, whilst Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, and Torfaen were on 9%. Mr Crompton said: ""Against a backdrop of existing funding pressures, the financial costs of the pandemic are unprecedented in modern times, and financial challenges go well beyond the more immediate and obvious costs of responding to the crisis. ""Therefore, good strategic financial planning and robust governance and decision-making arrangements have become even more important.""","Welsh councils are facing financial costs of Â£325m over the first six months of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Wales' spending watchdog."
"Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham told MSPs at Holyrood that a ""return to retail"" model would be adopted. She added that following an extensive consultation the deposit would be set at 20p. The move is part of the government's climate action plan. The minister said all retail outlets, regardless of size, would need to comply with the scheme. She explained that there had been a lot of discussion about whether to include glass in the plans. Ms Cunningham said it had been concluded that glass should be affected, despite some criticism from the glass industry. However, she added that HDPE-made plastic bottles, which are typically used to carry milk, would not be included. Containers made from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) - which typically carry fizzy drinks and water - will be subject to the deposit return. How does it work? Effectively, 20p - the deposit - will be added to the price of a single-use drinks container bought from a shop. The consumer will get their deposit back when they return the empty bottle or can to the retailer. The scheme will operate throughout Scotland, including rural areas. All types of drinks and all containers above 50ml and up to three litres in size are included. Businesses selling drinks which are opened and consumed on site - such as pubs and restaurants - will not have to charge the deposit to the public. How do I get my deposit back? There will be two ways you can return your empty container - over the counter, or by using a reverse vending machine (RVM). An RVM is a machine that scans containers when they are returned and then refunds your deposit. The government says there will be a range of ways you can get your 20p back, for example cash at a till, a token or discount voucher or digitally. The returned containers are stored in the machine and are then collected for recycling. As well as retailers and hospitality businesses, schools and other community hubs will be able to act as return locations. Will anyone be in charge of this scheme? The government says an independent, privately-run, not-for-profit company will be in charge. It adds that the system will be paid for through three sources of funding - unredeemed deposits, revenue from the sale of materials and a producer fee. When will this plan be implemented? The Scottish government said it was planning to introduce legislation later in the year. Once the Scottish Parliament has passed the necessary regulations, there will be an implementation period of at least 12 months before the scheme is up and running. Is this also happening in the rest of the UK? Scotland will likely be the first nation in the UK to introduce a bottle deposit return scheme. That is possible because recycling is a devolved issue. Currently, a consultation is taking place in England with a deposit of about 15p being mooted. Wales has been involved with the research being done for England. However, the Welsh government said it was already the third best place in the world for recycling, so it questioned whether a bottle deposit scheme would improve on that. In Northern Ireland, a deposit return scheme is also under consideration.","The Scottish government has outlined its plans for a deposit return scheme for some plastic drinking containers, cans and glass."
"Crews from West Midlands Fire Service are at the scene at The Cadbury Club on Bournville Lane, Bournville. People on Twitter reported hearing ""a huge boom"", while smoke could be seen from miles across the city. The fire broke out at about 16:45 BST. The fire service said there were no reported injuries, but urged people to avoid the road and surrounding area. Simon Harris, from the fire service, said crews were working to prevent the flames spreading to neighbouring buildings which are ""very close"" and were targeting the fire from all sides of the building. The blaze is affecting the whole building, which is often used by staff at the Cadbury factory, he said, and there were people inside the club at the time but all were accounted for. Up to 40 firefighters are at the scene and Mr Harris said it was ""extremely hard work in the heat"" and crews had not yet been able to bring the fire under control.

"By Kelly BonnerBBC Newsline A user told BBC News NI that getting heroin in the city was as easy as buying cigarettes. A councillor in Belfast who works with drug users said people will die if waiting lists are not shortened. ""I believe it's gone beyond epidemic,"" SDLP councillor Paul McCusker said, adding that he believes heroin addicts are being forgotten about. ""Our health trusts need to step up now and deal with this before we see more deaths,"" he said. The waiting list for heroin users in Belfast to get on to a substitute prescribing programme stands at a minimum of 29 to a maximum of 38 weeks. The programme allows addicts to move from heroin on to methadone in the hope that they will reduce their usage and eventually stop using heroin altogether. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said there had been a rise in demand in the past two-to-three years and that this had increased in the past six months. Users have told BBC News NI that waiting this length of time to get on to that potentially life-saving programme has had effects on their mental health. ""I fear that if I don't get onto this programme I will inject one day and not wake up,"" James said. 'Proper epidemic' He said getting heroin in Belfast was ""as easy as getting a packet of cigarettes"". ""It's simply ringing a number,"" he added. ""At the minute it's absolutely everywhere, Belfast is becoming a proper epidemic."" Life on the list James, from Belfast, has been addicted to heroin for two years and just two weeks ago he took an overdose. He told BBC News NI his addiction started by smoking heroin, which later led to injecting the drug and now he injects anything between one and four bags a day. ""I've seen a lot of people overdose, I've seen people that you'd think would never go anywhere near the drug and they're completely hooked on it now,"" he said. James has been trying to get help with his addiction since last year and meets a drug outreach worker several times a week. But he says trying to get through the waiting list for the heroin substitute proscribing programme is like ""constantly hitting a brick wall"". ""It's the same story every single week, it's 'you're near the top of the list, it's not going to be long'. ""In April they said it was going to be two to three weeks,"" James added. However, four months later he is still waiting and ""getting nowhere fast"". ""There doesn't seem to be any help out there. I've seen people take their own lives because of it, ""Some that have run up debts that they can't pay, they think there is no light at the end of the tunnel."" North Belfast councillor Paul McCusker said that when addicts like James took steps to seek help, it appeared that a ""door was being closed"" on them and that can have a ""dramatic effect on a person's recovery"". ""The key thing for anyone that is suffering a heroin addiction is early intervention, and we don't have that."" He added: ""James does tell that story of waiting every day on that phone call or letter, whether he is going to get the help or support he needs. ""It's a matter of life or death quite often. He speaks about [his fear that] his next hit could be his last hit. ""That is ridiculous to live every single day like that."" 'Risen significantly' The councillor said he has been calling on the Belfast Health Trust to take action on the waiting list for more than 18 months. A spokesperson for the Belfast Health Trust said that if demand continues to grow ""our capacity to meet this level of need is limited"". It is difficult to get a clear picture of the number of heroin users in Northern Ireland, with many users of the illegal drug not accessing support services. ""Anecdotally it is accepted across all sectors, including health and criminal justice that injecting drug misuse has increased in Belfast,"" the Public Health Agency (PHA) said in a statement to the BBC. There are two needle exchanges in Belfast city centre, where heroin users can exchange used needles for new ones. The exchanges have been open for 17 years and the number of people accessing the service has risen significantly in recent years. In the past four years, it has gone up by 82%, from 7,500 visits to almost 14,000. The PHA said it and the Health and Social Care Board are working to increase the number of needle exchange services in areas identified as having increased need and demand, bringing the total in Northern Ireland to between 28 and 33. The PHA also added that many people use the service regularly, so the number of users will be ""significantly lower"" than the number of visits and that the service is also used by people who inject steroids or tanning solution. Naloxone is a potentially life-saving drug, which can reverse the effects of a heroin overdose to allow the user to get medical help. Heroin users, their families and those who work with users can now be supplied with it. In the Belfast Health Trust area, there were 526 instances in which Naloxone was supplied in 2017/18 compared to being supplied 95 times the previous year.",The number of drug users trying to access heroin addiction services in Belfast has risen significantly.
"By Steven BrocklehurstBBC Scotland News The 97-year-old was at the Hogmanay matinee screening at which 71 children died. The auditorium was packed with more than 600 kids when the screen went black and somebody shouted ""fire!"", Mr Pope says. ""That's what caused all the panic,"" he says. The alarm had been raised after smoke from a film canister was seen in the auditorium. There was no fire but, as children panicked and rushed for the padlocked exits, many were trampled or crushed in the confusion. Seventy-one children died as a results of the events of 31 December 1929, including Mr Pope's friend Willie Spiers, who had been sitting beside him in the cinema. He died from injuries sustained in the panic. Mr Pope says he survived because he did not move from his seat. ""I was out for the count,"" he says. ""I never knew nothing. People were squealing, shouting, bawling."" Mr Pope remembers being roused by a fireman tapping him on the shoulder and telling him to run home to his mother. Looking back, he says his ""guardian angel"" must have been protecting him that day. Another survivor, Emily Brown, who is now 95, was five when she went to the cinema with her two sisters, aged three and 10, to watch the cowboy film Desperado Dude. Ms Brown told BBC Scotland there was a lot of panic when someone shouted ""fire"". She says there was a crush at the doors and people were jumping from the balcony on to the children below. She was saved when a fireman smashed a window and got her out. Emily was separated from her sisters but they also escaped. Some of her friends died. ""Everything stopped that day,"" she says. ""Most of the people in Paisley lost somebody. We were lucky, others weren't."" The disaster began as the film reached a crescendo. According to filmmaker Paul Mothersole, who has studied the tragedy for 15 years, the film operator spotted a reel of nitrocellulose film which had begun to smoulder. A later inquiry would conclude it was caused when the metal box containing the nitrate film had been placed on top of a battery in the projection room. It is thought that the box was taken out and placed in a backroom where it sprang open and smoke started to enter the packed auditorium. Mr Mothersole, who first interviewed survivors on the 75th anniversary, said it was an adult voice that shouted ""fire!"". The children panicked and ran towards the exits but the doors were locked. Not only were they locked but they were padlocked from the outside to stop children sneaking into the cinema. Mr Mothersole describes hundreds of children crushing up against the exit doors as well as others who could not get down from the balconies and chose to jump from the upper floor. ""It was like a pressure cooker,"" he says. ""Nobody can get out of the exits and the people in the balconies cannot get down the stairs. It just gets worse and worse."" Eventually a policeman managed to break the padlock to one of the doors but there was still a problem. The doors opened inward and there were bodies piled behind them. They had to force the door open to move the people piling up behind it. ""People were scrambling and climbing over the bodies to get out,"" Mr Mothersole says. The cinema was full because it was Hogmanay. At the time, it was a major Scottish tradition to clean the house ready for the new year. ""All the mothers kicked all the kids out so they could get the houses ready,"" Mr Mothersole said. The audience was all children and the ages ranged from babies, brought along by their older siblings, to about 14. Many families lost more than one child. As the tragedy unfolded, fathers were let out of the factories to help out and the tram cars used to ferry people to hospital. In the wake of the disaster, the Cinematograph Act of 1909 was amended to make sure cinemas would have more exits, and that escape doors were to be fitted with push bars that opened outwards. The building that housed the Glen Cinema still stands, and currently houses a furniture store. Mr Mothersole has made a documentary film about the disaster. He says more people should know the worst cinema disaster in British history.",Robert Pope was just seven when he was involved in the tragic events that took place in the Glen Cinema in Paisley 90 years ago.
"Motorists have been caught up in long queues on the A6 in Salford since it was reduced to one lane in each direction on Monday. It is part of work to regenerate the Chapel Street area and widen its pavements for pedestrians. Salford City Council leader John Merry has asked commuters to bear with them. The authority had issued a warning about ""significant disruption"" in the area and urged commuters to find alternative routes. But motorists have been caught in long early morning tailbacks on the A6 and delays have also been reported on the M602 and Regent Road because of people trying to avoid the area. 'Destination' bid Mr Merry said: ""I appreciate this is causing some frustration for commuters at the moment but we are confident the disruption will die down as people find new routes to work and get used to the new layout. ""I would ask that people bear with us during this time. ""This scheme is about developing this area of Salford to benefit both local residents by creating 11,000 new jobs and bringing more than Â£500m of investment into the region. ""Chapel Street, with all of its historic buildings and new development, will be more than just a commuter route, it will be a destination in its own right."" But some people are calling for a rethink of the work and an opposition Facebook group called ""Motorists against A6 improvements"" has been set up. The roadworks are the first stage of the project to regenerate the run-down Chapel Street area, which will include new housing, shops, cafes and other businesses.","Traffic problems caused by the start of roadworks on one of the main roads into Manchester city centre should soon ease, a council leader has said."
"By Katie WrayBBC News These impressive buildings may look lonely and forlorn but behind every mansion is a story. Winstanley Hall in Winstanley, Wigan Shiela Gummerson, 72, spent much of her childhood living in the grounds of Winstanley Hall, where her parents worked for its owners, the Bankes family. ""It was my own personal Downton Abbey,"" she said. ""We were downstairs and the Bankes family were upstairs."" The hall dates back to the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and had been the home of the Bankes family since 1595. Mrs Gummerson lived in a cottage on the grounds from 1942 until 1969 when her father, Frederick Parker, was their chauffeur and her mother, Sarah, was their cook. ""We got on well with the Bankes family. Every year they used to have a daffodil day once a year in the spring, where they'd invite local people to come and buy daffodils that would grow outside the Hall. Mother used to cook yeast buns and sell them to the locals."" She lived there until she was 27 when she got married. Her mother, by now a widow, left the cottage two years later. The last member of the Bankes family left the house in 1984 and the building has since fallen into disrepair. It was sold to developers in 2000 and Save Britain's Heritage is now working to rescue it from decay. While Mrs Gummerson has nostalgic memories towards the Hall, she has not been back since 1978. ""I can't bring myself to do it,"" she said. ""I can see on the internet what it looks like now and I get so upset."" Woodchester Mansion, near Nympsfield, Gloucestershire While most mansions fell into disrepair after decades of use, Woodchester Mansion was never actually finished. Work began in the 1850s but construction was abandoned in 1873. According to rumour, a French plasterer was bludgeoned to death in the kitchen and his spirit scared the tradesmen off the site. However, the more likely explanation for its abandonment is that the owner, William Leigh, ran out of money after taking out a Â£10,000 mortgage, according to the estate manager Hannah McCanlis. Andrew Fryer lived and worked in the mansion as a caretaker from 1994 until 2011. For the first 10 years he lived in one room on the ground floor with a Saniflo toilet. ""There were always weird things happening - noises coming from areas that no-one was allowed in,"" he said. Despite now standing empty, Woodchester Mansion does have some unusual residents. It houses five different breeds of bat. Two of the bat colonies, the lesser horseshoe and greater horseshoe, live in the attics of the mansion. The entire mansion is left in different states of incompletion, but the carved stonework is some of the best in the country, said Ms McCanlis. Woodchester Mansion currently attracts about 6,000 visitors yearly and is open six days a week between April and October. Witley Court in Worcestershire Today, Witley Court is a large and impressive ruin, but 100 years ago it was in spectacular condition. The rich industrialist Sir Herbert Smith bought the house in 1920 and lived there for 17 years until a devastating fire broke out in September 1937 while he was away. The blaze began in the bakery in the basement of the south-east corner of the house. Fanned by strong winds, the fire spread rapidly to the main rooms, completely gutting the central and eastern sections. According to English Heritage, insurance money would not pay for more than a quarter of the cost of rebuilding. Therefore Sir Herbert decided to leave the property, and it has been empty since 1938. English Heritage has restored the south garden. In addition to this, Wolfson Foundation funding has assisted with major restoration works in the East Parterre garden. Poltimore House, near Exeter in Devon Poltimore House dates back to the 16th Century and was home to the Bampfylde family for five centuries before becoming Poltimore College, a girls' school, in 1921. However, a fire destroyed the former ballroom wing in 1987 and it has since fallen prey to vandalism, theft and the effects of bad weather. Jocelyn Hemming, now 90 years old, was 21 when her parents bought the 112-acre estate in 1945. The family lived in two rooms on the ground floor while the house was converted into a hospital. She is now a member of the Poltimore House Trust, which has looked after the site since 2000 and hopes to restore it. ""I don't want to let the house go,"" she said. ""It needs a lot of tender loving care and money. ""But my parents really loved that place, and I know they would like to think we were looking after it."" Bank Hall in Bretherton, Lancashire Bank Hall, which dates back to the 17th Century, was used as a military headquarters during World War Two. The Royal Engineers used it as a base for co-ordinating the transatlantic crossing of convoys of merchant shipping and also billeted officers there between journeys. The Grade II-listed country house was built in 1608 but since the early 1960s it has been empty and ""at the mercy of vandals"", according to the Bank Hall Action Group, which is hoping to save it. Janet Edwards, the group's chairwoman, said she had been fascinated by the building since she was 10 years old and the group had run a 16-year campaign to save it. ""It is a project that no-one in their right minds would take on, but once under its spell, it is hard to walk away,"" she said. In February it was announced that Bank Hall would receive Â£1.69m for a restoration project from the Heritage Lottery Fund. Planning consent is currently in place to turn the hall into a series of apartments while the Prospect Tower will be open for public exhibitions and tours.","Evocative of an aristocratic and glorious history, there are many mansions around England that now stand empty or abandoned."
"Mike Bird, the leader of the controlling Conservative group at Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council, made the comments during a phone-in on BBC WM. A travellers charity previously said it was disgusted by Mr Bird's ""hate"". Mr Bird said he did not intend to cause offence. He told the BBC: ""I would like to express my sincere regret and apologies to anyone who was offended by the use of this deeply unpleasant word in relation to any community. ""I respect every community and individual equally and that is something I firmly believe in. ""I deeply regret any offence caused, it was certainly not intended or meant."" Mr Bird drew distinction between ""their"" and ""our"" culture and also accused travellers of thefts in the borough during a phone-in on Danny Kelly's mid-morning show on Thursday. One caller labelled travellers ""parasitic"" during a long complaint to which Mr Bird responded: ""The gentleman is absolutely 100% right."" Mr Bird had said: ""The ones that I've come across, they are a lawless society, they have no respect whatsoever for our community."" A spokesperson for charity Friends, Families and Travellers, which ""seeks to end racism and discrimination against Gypsies, travellers and Roma"", said it was ""disgusted"" by Mr Bird's comments which were filled with ""hate and based upon generalisations"". Phien O'Reachtagian, chairman of the Gypsy and Traveller Coalition, said previously: ""His suggestion that communities are lawless is cause for concern from someone in his position. ""We'd be looking to make a formal complaint and liaise with police to see if a crime has been committed.""","A council leader has apologised for saying travellers are a ""lawless society"" who ""run around on motorbikes shouting abuse""."
"The decision by District Judge Anselm Eldergill means Essex County Council can put the work by Lucien Pissarro up for auction. The Court of Protection, which said the man could not be identified, also confirmed his home could be sold. The court heard his monthly care home fees were about Â£400 and the man had a yearly cash shortfall of Â£15,000. The painting - the 1906 work ""Stratford-upon-Avon sunset"" - is thought to be worth between Â£20,000 and Â£30,000. 'High level of service' The man's son had initially objected to possessions being sold. But he told the court on Friday in a statement he had changed his mind. The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and analyses issues involving vulnerable and sick people. Hearings usually take place in private. Judge Eldergill said the man was moved into a care home after surgery. The judge said a local authority had been appointed to make decisions for the man because he had been found to ""lack capacity"". ""The court is wholly satisfied that the county council has provided (the pensioner) with a very high level of service,"" said the judge.","A valuable painting can be sold to pay for its elderly owner's care, a judge has ruled."
"Several people were forced to leave their homes on Tuesday night after serious flooding in the city. Dawn Grieve and her two boys, aged two and four years, were in their property in the Ivy Mead area when they were rescued on Wednesday morning. She said it was ""like a scene out of a film"". ""I had to leave the house, I actually got a tractor ride out of there by two local boys who are farmers - their mum lives at the top of our street,"" she said. ""I have two young boys and we had to get out of there at about half three this morning. ""It was too bad for them - they were scared, they didn't have a clue what was going on ""I have never witnessed anything like it in my lifetime and they certainly haven't."" 'Up to the window sills' Ms Grieve said that her husband had noticed water lapping close to the edge of their driveway at about 22:00 BST on Tuesday, following heavy rainfall. ""At that stage, we knew we were in a bit of trouble, but it was amazing what I witnessed from the community, everyone was running to a local area where they could get sand and bringing it back, as well as pillowcases,"" she added. ""It was whatever they could get, just to barricade up people's homes. ""Unfortunately it was a wee bit too late for us, the water had got in and there was nothing we could do about it."" She said that at the time of the rescue, the water was over the level of the first stair in the family's property, and ""was making its way to the second stair"". ""I have to say we were not the worst affected in the Ivy Mead area, just around the bend from us there were people who had water coming up to the window sills on their ground floor,"" she said. Ms Grieve said her husband had remained in the home overnight, with her father-in-law, in case there was more rain. ""At five thirty, he was able to tell me that he had swept most of the water out,"" she added.",A mother from Londonderry has described how she was rescued from her flooded home by tractor along with her two young sons.
"In a poignant reminder political careers can come to an abrupt halt, the building once occupied by Ben Gummer contains packing boxes and bags. At the back of the building, perched on a wooden pallet, sits a billboard depicting Mr Gummer. He lost out to Labour for the Ipswich seat in June by fewer than 1,000 votes. Mr Gummer had held the seat for seven years before losing to Sandy Martin in the general election. At the time, he said: ""I've learned so much from being a member of parliament, more than I could ever have hoped to have learnt in another role, and I feel a better person for it with broader opportunities and views than I otherwise would have had."" His old office in Fore Street is being advertised by Goldings Auctions with a guide price of Â£60,000. The BBC understands the lease was up at the Grade II-listed building before the general election. According to the estate agent, the freehold property offers an opportunity for ""a new lease of life"".","The constituency office of the MP who wrote the Tories' manifesto is up for sale, photographed complete with discarded election paraphernalia."
"Stuart Campbell, who runs the blog Wings Over Scotland, is suing the MSP for Â£25,000 after she criticised him in a newspaper column. The dispute stems from a piece written by Ms Dugdale in the Daily Record. Mr Campbell appeared as the first witness in the defamation case at Edinburgh Sheriff court on Monday. His remarks were posted on his Twitter feed on 3 March 2017 as he was live-tweeting about the Scottish Conservative conference. Pro-Scottish independence campaigner Mr Campbell wrote: ""Oliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner."" Mr Mundell's father, Scottish Secretary David Mundell, came out as gay in January 2016. Ms Dugdale wrote in her column in 2017 that she was ""shocked and appalled"" about what she described as ""homophobic tweets"". She added that ""such comments are of course not unique to the man who tweets as Wings Over Scotland"", saying the account ""spouts hatred and homophobia towards others"". Ms Dugdale later called on SNP politicians to ""shun"" Mr Campbell during First Minister's Questions. Mr Campbell subsequently launched legal action, arguing that while his tweets could be ""rude"" he was ""absolutely not"" prejudiced, and saying Ms Dugdale had defamed him by suggesting he was homophobic. Ms Dugdale's legal team submitted to the court that the article was a ""fair and honest comment"" criticising Mr Campbell for ""giving voice to homophobic sentiments"". The UK Labour Party previously paid for Ms Dugdale's representation in court, but cut this off in September last year. Equal rights 'advocate' Mr Campbell told the court that his tweet was making a ""commentary"" that Oliver Mundell was ""a very very poor public speaker"". He said: ""I don't think any intelligent person could honestly interpret that tweet as being homophobic."" Mr Campbell likened it to another online comment where the writer wished controversial columnist Katie Hopkins had never been born. The blogger agreed ""very much"" with his QC that it was unacceptable for someone to be mocked on the basis of their sexuality. He added that he was a ""firm advocate of equal rights for gay people"", saying anyone who had read his Twitter feed or website would find it ""ludicrous"" to think he was homophobic. While being questioned by Ms Dugdale's legal team, Mr Campbell said someone would have to be ""dishonest or stupid"" to think his tweet was homophobic. Mr Campbell was then asked if he thought Nicola Sturgeon was being ""dishonest or stupid"" in her response to the tweet during First Minister's Questions. He replied that he did not believe she made any ""specific reference"" to his tweet, but if the first minister believed it was homophobic then she was being stupid. The court examined a series of other tweets Mr Campbell had sent in the past, dealing with issues ranging from video games to gender self-identification. He denied any of them were evidence of homophobia or transphobia. 'Destroys your credibility' Paul Kavanagh, author of the pro-independence blog Wee Ginger Dug, and director of Stonewall Scotland Colin Macfarlane were also called as witnesses. Mr Kavanagh told the court he personally did not think the 2017 Mundell tweet was homophobic, and had not seen anything on the Wings Over Scotland blog that he considered homophobic. He said that for a blogger, being called a homophobe was like being called a racist or a holocaust denier. He added that it ""destroys your credibility"" and makes it hard for you to ""reach no voters or people who are undecided."" ""It has a very damaging effect,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Macfarlane said he was ""disappointed"" by Mr Campbell's 2017 tweet, saying it was ""wholly unnecessary to reference David Mundell's sexuality"" and that it had been made the ""punchline"" of the tweet. Ms Dugdale is expected to give evidence on Tuesday, while the court heard that David Mundell had invoked parliamentary privilege and would not be appearing.","A blogger who has taken former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale to court said it was ""absurd"" to interpret one of his tweets as homophobic."
"Two Swedes and one Belgian also died in the attack on Friday, when a hijacked lorry was driven into a store. His family said they were devastated by the ""untimely and tragic death"" of the ""wonderful husband, son, father, brother and close friend to many"". The suspect, a 39-year-old man from Uzbekistan, had been facing deportation, Swedish police said. Crispin Bevington - known as Chris - worked as a director with music streaming service Spotify. The father-of-two was based in Stockholm with his family. His father John said: ""We are all devastated by the untimely and tragic death of our talented, compassionate and caring son Chris. ""A wonderful husband, son, father, brother and close friend to many. ""The family requests absolute privacy at this incredibly difficult time to mourn his passing in peace.""

He said: ""He has had a great impact on not just the business but on everyone who had the privilege to know and work with him. ""There are no words for how missed he will be or for how sad we all are to have lost him like this. ""Whilst this terrible news is sinking in, our primary focus is on supporting the family and loved ones of Chris in any way we possibly can. Mr Ek said he was as ""deeply saddened and upset"" as everyone that such an attack could happen in Sweden. The only light, he said, was the consequent ""outpouring of love, compassion and solidarity"". He added: ""We will greatly miss you Chris. Rest in Peace my friend."" In a press conference on Sunday, police said the suspect was known to have extremist sympathies. A further 15 people were injured in the attack. Ten are still being treated in hospital, four of them in a serious condition. Police later said they had found a suspect device inside the lorry, which had been hijacked from a beer company before hitting the Ahlens store. No terrorist group has claimed to be behind the attack. A UK Foreign Office spokesman said: ""Stockholm Police have confirmed that a British man was killed during the attack in Stockholm. ""We are supporting his family in Sweden and in the UK. Our thoughts are with them and all those affected at this terrible time. ""We will stand shoulder to shoulder with Sweden as they deal with this tragedy."" 'Marginal character' Stockholm police said the suspected attacker, arrested later on Friday, had previously been sought by authorities for deportation. He had sought residency in Sweden in 2014, but his application was rejected last year. He had expressed support for extremist organisations including the Islamic State group, police said. While he was known to security services, he was seen only as a ""marginal character"", Sweden's National Police Commissioner Dan Eliasson added. Meanwhile, a second suspect has been placed under formal arrest. Reuters news agency said it was on ""a lower degree of suspicion"" than the first suspect. Police have interviewed more than 500 people over the incident, Sweden's TT news agency reports. Thousands of people have gathered in a square in central Stockholm on Sunday for a vigil against terrorism. Prime Minister Theresa May pledged solidarity with Sweden in the wake of the attack, with a Downing Street spokesman saying she had called her counterpart, Stefan Lofven, to express her condolences. The spokesman added: ""She was clear that the UK stands firmly by Sweden's side, and they agreed on the importance of working together to tackle these threats, which we all continue to face."" Sweden has taken in nearly 200,000 refugees and migrants in recent years - more per capita than any other European country. However, there was a drop in numbers last year after the country introduced new border checks. Separately, more than 300 people have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq, making Sweden per capita one of the biggest exporters of jihadists in Europe.",A British man killed in the Stockholm lorry attack has been named as 41-year-old Chris Bevington.
"It has published a ""roadmap"" setting out its plans to help businesses and motorists switch to electric vehicles. The government is to spend more than Â£14m over the next two years replacing its fleet of petrol and diesel vehicles with electric alternatives. It will also install charging points at all of its main buildings. The Switched On Scotland document was produced alongside experts from industry, academia and environmental bodies, and sets out the plan to drive forward the uptake of electric vehicles in Scotland. Among its commitments are that by 2050, Scottish towns, cities and communities will be free from the ""damaging effects"" of petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles. By 2040 almost all new vehicles sold will be near zero-emission at the tailpipe; and by 2030 half of all fossil-fuelled vehicles will be phased out of urban environments across Scotland. Grants of up to Â£5,000 are available towards the purchase cost of an electric car, with up to Â£8,000 available for the purchase of an electric van. Scottish households that buy an electric vehicle will also continue to receive a 100% grant for a home charging point. The government has pledged to provide new ways of supporting motorists to adopt electric vehicles by providing expert advice on their environmental and financial benefits. And discounted ferry fares for electric vehicles on all routes to Mull and Bute are being introduced as part of a pilot scheme. Electric vehicle owners currently pay no road tax, with the government stating that electric cars are also cheaper to run at 2p or 3p a mile compared with 16p a mile for the average fossil-fuelled family car. A third of all car journeys in Scotland are less than two miles long, with nearly a quarter of all trips being of one mile or less. 'Health and wellbeing' In a regular car, these journeys are said to emit a disproportionate amount of carbon into the air, whereas electric vehicles provide a cleaner method of transport. But Norwegian research published last year suggested electric cars might actually pollute much more than petrol or diesel-powered models. Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said the plans to replace petrol and diesel vehicles by 2050 were a ""bold vision"" that would require a ""transformation in how we think about moving people and goods around."" He added: ""This transformation is absolutely vital to achieve our ambitious climate change targets. ""It will also help improve local air quality with a resultant improvement in public health and wellbeing and contribute toward further energising Scotland's economy through opportunities for our flourishing green technology industries and our renewable energy sector."" It later emerged the roadmap was to be revised, after Transport Scotland conceded it had included mobility scooters in figures showing an increase in the number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicle registrations last year. The actual number was 235 - well below the figure of 1,000 initially claimed. And Green MSP Alison Johnstone said the Scottish government was wrong to think that electric cars were the answer to congestion and pollution problems. She added: ""There are just a tiny handful of electric cars on our roads and I see no sign that uptake is going to dramatically increase. ""More could be achieved right now by repairing our potholed roads, making streets safer for cyclists and pedestrians, and making public transport accessible for more people.""

"By Sam FrancisBBC News, London On 7 May, voting was due to take place in the capital for the London mayor but to help restrict the spread of coronavirus the election will now not take place until May 2021. The delay has already claimed its first casualty. On Wednesday, former Conservative cabinet minister Rory Stewart dropped out of the race. The former MP said it was impossible to keep a campaign going for another year as an independent candidate. But just because the race has been delayed, it does not mean campaigning has stopped. Sadiq Khan, Labour candidate and current mayor of London From a back room of his Tooting home, Sadiq Khan runs a temporary version of the mayor's office. Instead of canvassing election day was spent ""talking to colleagues via phone and video calls about how we're responding to the COVID-19 crisis across London,"" he told the BBC. Coronavirus has turned the ""daily rhythms of all our lives upside down,"" he said. ""Under normal circumstances, I would have spent election day knocking on doors from sunrise until well into the evening, trying to persuade as many Londoners as possible to re-elect me mayor of London. ""The last few weeks have of course changed everything."" ""Each of the thousands of deaths from COVID-19 have been devastating for the families and communities affected. ""I ended the day joining millions of other Londoners clapping for our heroic carers. We all continue to owe them a huge debt of gratitude."" Shaun Bailey, Conservative candidate Ahead of VE Day, Shaun Bailey spent election day speaking to volunteers at the Royal British Legion. ""Their work is very close to my heart. I'm an honorary colonel in the fusiliers, and my grandfather fought in Italy in WW2,"" he said. Despite the difficulties of lockdown Mr Bailey said he had seen the local community ""become even stronger"". ""My street's WhatsApp group has lit up my phone most evenings and our neighbours have been looking out for each other with offers of grocery shopping and regular contact. ""My campaign team and I have been drawing up plans on how to mobilise this community spirit once London is open again."" Much like in parliament, the Greater London Authority (GLA) is holding virtual committees or quizzing officials via Zoom for the first time. Mr Bailey said: ""Combining home-based arts and crafts with my job as a London Assembly Member, holding the mayor to account each day, has certainly kept me on my toes. ""And of course, once a week, my family and I join our neighbours outside to clap for the NHS. ""A great and regular reminder that we are not alone in this crisis."" Sian Berry, Green candidate ""In City Hall we're getting back to holding the mayor to account,"" Sian Berry told the BBC. The Green Party co-Leader spent election day working on the GLA's Oversight Committee, scrutinising the mayor's response to the coronavirus crisis. Last month she began a YouTube news show from her living room. ""I've been trying to connect with Londoners in new ways,"" she said. Along with an interview on BBC Radio London, Ms Berry spent much of election day planning her next social media broadcast. ""We're bringing in people who are working on the crisis,"" Ms Berry said. ""We're continuing to inform people about vital issues and to help buoy up people's spirits a bit, in imaginative ways during lockdown. ""Instead of business as usual under the current mayor, this is all about showing how we can learn from this crisis and start to create a better world."" Siobhan Benita, Liberal Democrat candidate Finding herself with a political campaign team but no election, Siobhan Benita decided to put the money and resources towards a new initiative. ""We realised we can use the phone bank we have and phone numbers we have to touch base with vulnerable people across London who may find themselves isolated at the moment. ""Thursday was like most of my days at the moment, organising Call with Kindness scheme, which aims to identify people who might be struggling with lockdown."" ""They're the nicest calls I've ever made,"" Ms Benita said. Ms Benita escaped the lockdown to help organise her local food bank. ""I'm a donation point and people can drop things off on my porch, and I go in to help pack. ""It's been a great way to see how people are coping."" Before the pandemic, Ms Benita admits she was not as high in the polls as she would have liked. ""But the delay is an opportunity to reset and rethink,"" she said. ""With Rory dropping out there has been a change in dynamics. When campaigning starts again we will have an opportunity to provide a truly liberal voice for London.""

He said it has a long, successful history with Liverpool ""from the day it launched and aired the first episode of Brookside"". Mr Rotheram said the city ""has everything Channel 4 needs - amazing locations, quick and easy access to production hubs"" and would ""revolutionise the city region's creative industry"". Mr Redmond said Liverpool was the ""north's most cultural city... renowned for its creativity and zest for innovation"". ""From the written word, through performance, sport and production, to the national museums and leading edge science and technology, Liverpool is always a first mover,"" he added. ""Alongside this, the legacy of Brookside lives on with Hollyoaks, plus the best Screen School and Film Office in the UK, provide a creative firmament unmatched anywhere else."" Liverpool John Moores University is also on the bid steering group. Liberal Democrat leader on the city council Richard Kemp said it was ""absolutely right"" Liverpool make the bid so it can ""add to and gain from the vibrant arts and cultural scene which is the best in the country"". Green councillor Sarah Jennings, who represents St Michaels ward, said: ""Liverpool desperately needs a significant media headquarters to give us critical mass and credibility. C4 is the obvious choice."" Liverpool's Conservative party is yet to comment.","Liverpool is launching a ""compelling bid"" to host Channel 4's new national headquarters, the city council says."
"The case, in 2008, was one of more than 60 Serious Untoward Incidents (SUIs) recorded by the South Western Ambulance Service between 2007 and 2009. After the undertakers found signs of life in the man, paramedics returned to take him for treatment. The service said such SUIs were a small proportion of incidents it attended. The crew was called to the patient in November 2008 after police entered the man's house following reports he had not been seen for four days. Paramedics found no palpable pulse or signs of respiration and left, leaving police to contact the coroner, the service said. Officers then left the scene before the undertakers arrived. But, on moving him, the undertakers found the man breathing and an ambulance was called. Although paramedics cannot certify death, they can decide not to administer treatment because they believe a patient is dead. The crew did not administer treatment at first because of their original findings, the service said. In another case in May 2009, a patient with severe chest pains was allowed to walk unaided up two flights of stairs. He died later in an ambulance. CCTV of the incident appeared to show the ambulance crew carrying out no checks on him. The cases were two of 62 SUIs between 2007 and 2009 listed in information from the service - which covers Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, Devon, Dorset and Somerset - obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. Of those, 20 were recorded in 2007, with 29 in 2008 and 13 in 2009. 'Culture of openness' An SUI is defined as an accident or incident when a patient, member of staff or member of the public suffers serious injury, major permanent harm or unexpected death or the risk of death or injury. They can occur on health service premises, premises where health care is provided and where actions of health staff are likely to cause public concern. Thirty-four were blamed on human error, including nine cases of wrong diagnosis. Twenty-three incidents were blamed on equipment failure, including one case in 2008 where an out-of-hours doctor discovered there were battery problems in equipment he was about to use to resuscitate a cardiac arrest patient. Dr Andy Smith, medical director of the service, said: ""When you look at these incidents, it works out at roughly less than three per 100,000 call-outs."" He added that the service had a culture of openness and staff were encouraged to report any incidents immediately ""so we can investigate... and learn lessons"". Alan Lofthouse, from the union Unison, added that crews were honest when things went wrong. He said: ""We're open to scrutiny from the public, we are all professional and we are all accountable.""","A man who paramedics in south-west England wrongly thought was dead was later found breathing by undertakers, it has been revealed."
"Paying tribute to Mr Cameron during his final Prime Minister's Questions, the MP suggested a complete career change. He said leadership roles were available as manager of the English football team, presenter of Top Gear or as the next occupant of the White House. Mr Cameron laughed but said the posts sounded ""even harder"" than his own job. 'Fascinating suggestions' The prime minister was given a standing ovation by Conservative MPs in the House of Commons, as he prepared to hand over power to Theresa May on Wednesday. Mr Kinahan commended Mr Cameron's record in office, saying: ""May we thank the prime minister for all his hard work and his leadership and particularly his commitment to the union and to Northern Ireland."" The South Antrim MP said his party was looking forward to working with the next prime minister but also offered the incumbent some career advice. ""I'm told that there are lots of leadership roles out there at the moment,"" Mr Kinahan said. ""There's the England football team, there's Top Gear, there's even across the big pond a role that needs filling."" Mr Cameron thanked the UUP member for his ""kind remarks and fascinating suggestions for future jobs."" He added that most of them ""sound even harder than this one, so I think I'll pass"". During his tribute, Mr Kinahan said the prime minister had visited Northern Ireland ""often"" during his six-year tenure. He reminded him of the time he went for an early morning dip in Lough Erne, when County Fermanagh hosted the 2013 G8 summit and he invited Mr Cameron back to swim in Lough Neagh. In response to Mr Kinahan's final question - about the threat to the UK posed by its decision to leave the European Union - Mr Cameron said Northern Ireland was stronger now than when he came to power six years ago.","If David Cameron is looking for a new job as he steps down as prime minister, he was given plenty of ideas by Ulster Unionist MP Danny Kinahan."

"Chris Gould, 17, died in January 2019 while an informal patient at a mental health unit near Cambridge. Her parents told the inquest that clinicians felt alleged abuse was the ""root"" of her mental health problems. Last month, the coroner found there were ""shortcomings"" around the death of her twin sister Sam in September 2018. Chris's inquest at Huntingdon Town Hall heard a statement from her parents Ian Gould and Jane Cannon. It said she was a keen snowboarder, ""adored"" horse riding and that she and her sister were ""fiercely, fiercely loyal to one another"". Mrs Cannon said: ""[Chris] loved writing - her creative writing throughout school was always commented on."" Mrs Cannon told the inquest she had been to many concerts with Chris, and one of her favourite bands was Creeper, who ""we followed all around the country"". While being taken through evidence by coroner Nicholas Moss QC, her parents said the alleged abuse first began in 2007. The inquest heard that aged about 14 or 15 it became ""clear"" the twins were struggling with their mental health, and in May 2016 Chris made an attempt to take her own life. The following month the alleged abuse was disclosed to police, but later that year they were told by Hampshire Constabulary there would be no further action. The parents agreed that both Chris and Sam felt ""invalidated and not believed"" after the investigation ended. If you are affected by issues raised in this article, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line. If you or someone you know needs support for issues relating to mental health, these organisations may be also able to help. Mrs Cannon had earlier told the coroner that the parents had ""never doubted... for a moment"" the honesty and reliability of what they had been told about the alleged abuse. She said health professionals accepted that abuse was the ""root of the mental health problems"". Sam's inquest was told the criminal investigation was closed because the sisters had not wanted to provide an evidential account in a video interview. Mr Moss found at the previous inquest that Sam's borderline personality disorder was the ""main cause of her death"", which was assessed ""to be related to allegations of prolonged sexual abuse in her earlier childhood"" and that she had taken her own life from an overdose of prescription drugs. Mrs Cannon said that following Sam's death: ""We were horribly aware that what was already an uphill battle was considerably steeper."" The inquest heard Chris, from Fulbourn near Cambridge, was an informal patient at the Darwin Centre, a mental health unit in Fulbourn run by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust.

"Sarah Rook, of Surbiton, ""persistently"" stalked the BBC presenter at his London home and work in February and March, Stratford Magistrates' Court heard. She denied the charges but when asked if she wanted to give evidence, she told the court it was ""probably a waste of an exercise"". She will be sentenced on 22 June. The court previously heard Rook had turned up outside the DJ's home and hurled abuse at him and his family. Mr Peterson said she had shouted ""very extreme words"" at him and his Japanese wife, and accused him of being a ""paedophile"" and a ""rapist"". Rook was seen shouting obscenities outside the 55-year-old's studio, while the DJ also received abusive tweets while presenting his 6 Music show. ""It was a very traumatic situation. I was concerned. It seemed to be so frantic and extreme,"" he said. The DJ's wife Atsuko told the court Rook had ""screamed"" racist abuse at her ""repeatedly"". ""It was racist words. it was targeted towards me,"" she said. The court was shown footage, recorded by the couple's son, of Rook outside the family home shouting and swearing towards the house. Peter Keyes, a close protection officer, told the court he had seen Ms Rook waiting outside the BBC's Wogan House radio studios on 21 March while he escorted Mr Peterson to his car. He said the DJ's expression ""completely changed to one of concern"" and he told him ""she's coming, that's her, she's coming"". 'Freelance investigation' Rook had pleaded not guilty to stalking, racially aggravated harassment and an alternative charge of non-aggravated harassment, against the DJ whose surname is Moehrle. She did not give evidence in court but did provide a written statement which said she was conducting a ""freelance investigation"" into the history of a jazz club owner linked to author John Steinbeck. District Judge Cieciora convicted Rook of stalking the DJ, saying the 43-year-old had engaged in a ""campaign against Mr Moehrle"". She also found that the harassment against Mrs Moehrle had been racially aggravated, while Rook was also convicted of racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress against PC Karlene Richards. Rook swore at the officer after her arrest on 16 March.",A woman who repeatedly screamed abuse at DJ Gilles Peterson and his family has been found guilty of stalking and harassment.
"About 1.5% of Wiltshire Police officers are black, which the force described as a ""disappointing position"" to be in. Sgt Ronnie Lungu, 40, was promoted from constable rank after a tribunal found he had been discriminated against. The force said opportunities to promote minority officers from within were ""quite limited"" due to low numbers. Wiltshire Police currently employs 14 black constables and two black sergeants, according to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request by BBC Wiltshire. It has 1,039 officers in total. 'Quite restricted' In April, Sgt Lungu - who joined the force in 2003 - claimed he had been passed over for promotion because of his race and a Bristol tribunal ruled in his favour. Kier Pritchard, temporary assistant chief constable, said: ""At this stage we have a small number of officers and staff who are from Black Minority Ethnic (BME) communities, so therefore our opportunity to be able to promote from within, and actually move our staff to higher positions of supervision and management, is actually quite limited and quite restricted for us."" He added it was important to understand from BME communities why there had only been ""a small number of applications"" for people to join the service. Jabeer Butt, deputy chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, said there was ""a long way to go"" to ensure police forces represented their communities and offered equal opportunities to progress within the ranks. ""It's also quite clear that some of the discriminatory practices that have been around for a while still operate and we still have racism operating within the police force [nationally],"" he said.",A police officer who took Wiltshire Police to a racism tribunal is the only black officer to be promoted within the force in the past five years.

"About 50 members of the European Research Group (ERG) openly discussed ""how best you game the leadership election rules,"" a source said. Eurosceptic MPs are to unveil what they say is a solution to the Irish border. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said leadership speculation was ""loose talk"" and urged MPs to unite behind the PM. Mr Gove said he wanted Mrs May to stay in Downing Street ""as long as possible"" and believed her much-criticised Chequers blueprint for future relations with the EU could win the support of Parliament. Leadership speculation was ""like the weather...feature of British life"", he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""This is loose talk. There is always loose talk. The critical thing is we deliver on the Brexit mandate and any diversion or distraction from that commitment means our ability to ensure that it delivered is undermined."" Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Read the full glossary here The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the significance of the ideas discussed at the ERG meeting would have to be considered as leading Tory Brexiteers - Jacob Rees-Mogg, Owen Paterson, Iain Duncan Smith, Bernard Jenkin, David Davis, Boris Johnson - were not present. Mrs May says she wants to strike a trade deal with the EU for after the UK leaves in 2019. She also says there needs to be ""friction-free movement of goods"" with no customs or regulatory checks between the UK and EU on the island of Ireland, in order to avoid a hard border there. The ERG strongly opposes these proposals, which form part of what has become known as the Chequers plan. One MP present at the meeting on Tuesday evening said the group considered ""possible scenarios over the Autumn"" depending on the deal the prime minister did or didn't get with the EU, BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said. Comments at Tuesday evening's meeting were said to include ""everyone I know says she has to go"", ""she's a disaster"" and ""this can't go on"". We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...

Swipe to progress If you can't see the explainer, follow this link One source said ""people feel the leadership is out of touch and has lost the plot"", but another said changing the leader ""is a stupid idea now"". A number told the meeting in Westminster that they had already submitted letters of no confidence in Mrs May. However, it is understood they are not planning an immediate move against her. A Conservative leadership contest can be triggered either if the leader resigns or if 15% of Tory MPs (currently 48) write to the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, demanding a vote of no confidence. Are Tory MPs ready to move against May? By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg There is massive frustration with her leadership, her position on Chequers and the way her proposals tuck the UK closely into the EU in perpetuity. And yes, there are some MPs who want to see her gone immediately. However senior voices in the European Research Group are adamant that it is not the time to try to oust the PM. It would be ""stupid"", one told me last night. Imagine in these critical weeks of the Brexit negotiations if the UK started to try to change the prime minister. Right now those jostling to remove her know they don't have any guarantees they would have the numbers to force her out, even though they may well be able to pull together enough MPs to submit letters to the chair of 1922 committee to trigger a contest. Alternative plans for the border are due to be unveiled at an event in London which will be attended by former Northern Ireland Secretaries Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, the former Brexit Secretary David Davis and former Northern Ireland First Minister Lord Trimble. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who chairs the ERG, said the group would offer a solution ""that any reasonable person would accept"". With the UK due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, the challenge has been to avoid a so-called hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - which is an EU member. Both sides are keen to avoid the imposition of barriers and checkpoints amid warnings of damage to cross-border trade and disruption to the Good Friday Agreement, which was signed in April 1998 and helped bring an end to 30 years of sectarian conflict, known as the Troubles. The government says its plan for ""harmonisation"" with EU trade rules and a ""combined customs territory"" with the EU will avoid friction at the border.

But critics say this would get in the way of the UK trading freely with countries outside the EU. The government's Chequers plan has not yet been accepted by the EU. Both sides have also agreed on the need for a ""backstop"" agreement to avoid new physical infrastructure on the border, irrespective of the final deal that is negotiated. Some Brexiteers have claimed the border issue is being ""exploited"" by the EU and Remain supporters to keep the UK closely tied to Brussels. Speaking at the launch of the ""clean-break"" proposals, attended by Tory Brexiteers on Tuesday, Mr Rees-Mogg said the border was the only thing standing in the way of the UK negotiating a free trade deal like the EU has with Canada. He added: ""It is possible to move very swiftly to a Canada-plus style deal as long as we can come up with a scheme, which I think we have got for tomorrow, on how do you ensure a solution to the Northern Ireland problem that any reasonable person would accept?""",Conservative MPs opposed to Theresa May's Brexit plan have met to discuss how and when they could force her to stand down as prime minister.
"By Liam BarnesBBC News The images, which depict pubs run by the once-mighty London-based Charrington Brewery, were rescued from a skip by Robert Humphreys, where they had been dumped as the company moved offices a quarter of a century ago. The brewery grew from humble beginnings in the 18th Century to own pubs across the country, many of which were thoroughly documented in regular surveys. More than 3,000 photographs were rescued by Mr Humphreys, at the time an area manager for the brewery, and taken to the former Bass Museum, now the National Brewery Centre, in Burton-upon-Trent for safekeeping. His actions preserved valuable information about pubs, landlords and drinking habits across the generations. The National Brewery Heritage Trust (NBHT) has worked to share the archive with the public, and, after being scanned and cleaned digitally, the Charrington collection has been put online by Historypin as part of a nationwide project. Mr Humphreys, who worked for Charrington for 20 years from 1973 and is now a member of the NBHT, said the pictures are ""priceless"" records of 20th Century life, and welcomed the efforts to open up the archive to the public. ""I think it's fair to say that this collection has some completely irreplaceable images,"" he said. ""Some are very high quality and were mounted on cards at the museum, which also had a lot of important information about the pubs, like old tenants, how much beer they sold and other things."" NBHT chairman Harry White said he ""could not be more delighted"" with the digitisation, the first major project undertaken by the trust. ""This stunning collection was within moments of being lost forever,"" he said. Charrington Brewery Due to his long association with the brewery, Mr Humphreys says he is still contacted by family members of former workers looking to find out more about their relatives. He hopes opening the collection up will help more people contribute their own stories and shed more light on the life of Charrington Brewery and its employees. ""I'm so pleased it's happened - it could just so easily have disappeared,"" he said. Lise Schauer, from Historypin, started working on the digitisation project in June. She said she was ""flabbergasted by the depth and quality"" of the archive rescued from the Charrington skip. ""I couldn't believe it was just going to be thrown away,"" she said. Pete Boswell, managing director of digital specialists Photo Legacy, spent four and a half months digitising the photographs in the collection. He hopes to work on bringing more old images of pubs to life. ""They're very interesting, and they have an appeal to many different types of people,"" he said. ""I'll certainly be working with other collections that aren't held by the trust. We've had some very good conversations, and I'm confident that we will be seeing more soon."" The project is set to continue into next year, having secured funding from Amsterdam-based cultural heritage group Europeana Food and Drink, and Ms Schauer hopes visitors to the Historypin collection will add more historical photos to the site. ""We'd like to improve on what we've got - anything that makes the metadata richer would be great,"" she said. ""Pubs attract a lot of different types of people, they're a hub that a lot of people want to try and save."" Ms Schauer has high hopes the Charrington photos can lead to a bigger social history project detailing the history of thousands of British institutions. ""This whole project was about how we can get this archive sitting in a box in Burton and open it up to people,"" she said. ""Everyone has their own experience of a pub, and it's easier to unlock life stories by starting there.""","An ""irreplaceable"" archive of photographs of some of the country's most striking public houses that was nearly lost to posterity forever has been made available to the public."
"Work to set up the SurreySave credit union to help people across the county began seven years ago. Volunteers have now been promised enough funding for the project to apply to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to register it as a business. Credit unions are small-scale savings and loan co-operatives that typically serve people on low incomes. Chairman of the executive committee and Guildford borough councillor David Wright said: ""After seven years of hard work and negotiations with partners from local councils, housing associations and local trusts we at last have enough promised funding and support to apply for an FSA licence. ""SurreySave will make a major difference to the domestic budgets of many Surrey households, and offer an ethical and safe home for their savings.""

"Theresa May will set out measures to boost cooperation between the UK and Jordan to tackle extremism on a visit to the capital Amman on Monday. She will also discuss supporting the country with the influx of refugees fleeing the conflict in Syria. The prime minister will be on a three-day trip to the Middle East. Training will be carried out in Jordan and the UK to help its air force improve its capability to strike IS targets. 'Save lives' Mrs May is also visiting Saudi Arabia during her trip where the focus will be on strengthening trade and security ties as Britain prepares to leave the EU. She said it was ""clearly in the UK's security and prosperity interests"" to support Jordan and Saudi Arabia. ""To tackle the threats we face from terrorism and from geopolitical instability, we must meet them at their source,"" she said ahead of the visit. Mrs May said Jordan is on the frontline of ""multiple regional crises"" and working with Jordan would help ""keep British people safe"". ""Likewise in Saudi Arabia: we must never forget that intelligence we have received in the past from that country has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK,"" she added. 'Thorny questions' Saudia Arabia is the UK's largest trading partner in the Middle East with goods and services exports totalling Â£6.6bn in 2015. Britain supports and has helped arm the Saudi-led coalition fighting rebels in neighbouring Yemen. The government has been criticised for its involvement with Saudi Arabia due to the deaths of civilians and a continuing famine in the region. There has been pressure from MPs from across the political parties for a rethink of British policy. Mrs May's visit to Saudi Arabia will reopen thorny questions over support for human rights, says the BBC's deputy political editor John Pienaar.","Britain will send military trainers to Jordan to help the country's air force in the fight against so-called Islamic State, the prime minister is to say."
"It follows comments he made to the BBC that extra money for workers would be withheld in the absence of a deal. The British and Irish governments have published a draft deal to restore the executive after three years of political deadlock at Stormont. About 9,000 health workers are currently on strike over pay and staffing levels in NI. ""There is no money coming unless the executive gets up and running,"" Mr Smith told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I want to focus on public services, they need to get back to work,"" he said. Patricia McKeown, from Unison, told the BBC that the dispute over health workers' pay could be ""resolved immediately"". ""That's about holding the people of Northern Ireland at ransom,"" she said. ""It's about really infringing on their human rights, health workers and patients alike."" Assembly recall Mr Smith and TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney made the announcement of a draft deal at a media conference at Stormont on Thursday evening. The Northern Ireland Secretary had asked the Stormont speaker, Robin Newton, to arrange an urgent meeting of the assembly for Friday. However, on Friday morning, Mr Newton said the Northern Ireland Assembly will only be recalled if the political parties agree on a potential deal to restore power sharing. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said that the proposals are ""not perfect"" but offer a basis to move forward. Sinn FÃ©in is examining the draft deal at internal party meetings on Friday.

Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Smith said politicians have ""decisions to make but now is the time"". If agreed, the deal, entitled New Decade, New Approach, could see the assembly reconvene on Friday. Thursday marked three years to the day since Stormont collapsed. An assembly spokesperson said it was the speaker's responsibility to ensure arrangements are in place for a sitting to facilitate the appointment of an executive. She added: ""It is not for the speaker to react to political speculation and he has been clear that whether or not the deadline of 13 January can be met is a matter entirely for parties. ""While the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has requested that the speaker call a sitting of the assembly, the process of doing so remains one for the speaker to undertake in consultation with the parties."" The statement added: ""The speed and timing of any sitting therefore depends entirely on when the speaker hears positively from the parties."" 'An entirely different construct' Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Mrs Foster said she was ""hopeful"" that the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in can restore the executive. The DUP leader said she had spoken to Michelle O'Neill on Thursday evening. ""Discussions will continue throughout the day and hopefully we can get to a place where we can have the executive up and running again,"" she said. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The purpose of petition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier in the week, the Orange Order reiterated its opposition to a standalone Irish language act. But Mrs Foster argued that the new deal was ""an entirely different construct to what was suggested before"". Questioned on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan show about whether a unionist veto around the Irish language was included in the small print of the draft document, DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said standards ""set for the use of the Irish language have to be agreed by the first minister"". ""That does mean the DUP will have a very important and crucial say in how those standards are drawn up and what they will be,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday night, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""studying the text and will give it careful consideration"". ""The Sinn FÃ©in Ard Chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it,"" she added. Mr Smith said the deal will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government and asked all parties to support it. The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. The proposed deal also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation.","NI Secretary Julian Smith is ""holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom"", the union Unison has said."

"Jurors were played a recorded interview with the alleged victim during the trial of four men accused of grooming and sexually abusing her. They face 36 charges including the rape and indecent assault of the girl when she was aged between 13 and 15. Naim Khan, Mohammed Nazir, Raheem Ahmed, and Afzal Mohammed, all of Oxford, deny all the charges. Mr Khan, of no fixed address, is also accused of indecently assaulting a second girl and kidnapping and falsely imprisoning a third. Prosecutor Alan Gardner previously told the jury at Oxford Crown Court that attacks took place ""in parks, lavatories, unoccupied houses, and flats"", between 1999 and 2001. 'Sex part of a deal' In the police interview, the complainant told officers the three men had sex with her after she had been driven to a house in Howard Street. She said she knew one of the men as ""Naz"" and added the other men were Mr Khan and an unknown taxi driver who worked for Royal Cars. The court also heard Naz had ""asked"" the schoolgirl for oral sex in return for money, drugs and cigarettes on a different occasion. The alleged victim told officers she performed oral sex ""about nine times"" at a pet shop. She said: ""I was just thinking it was normal to do that."" The jury also heard that the woman pointed out Mr Mohammed to police officers as he walked past the crown court when she was with them during the investigation. ""I felt a bit anxious,"" she said.

Mr Gardner previously told the court that the defendants created ""the notion that sexual activity was part of the deal, something to be provided by the girls in return for what the males gave them"".","A woman told police she had sex with three men at a house in Oxford when she was a schoolgirl, a jury has heard."
"Karen Bradley said that killings at the hands of the security forces were ""not crimes"". She later clarified that ""where there is evidence of wrongdoing, it should always be investigated"". John Kelly, whose teenage brother Michael was killed on Bloody Sunday, described her remarks as ""outrageous"". ""Her place now is untenable - she should go,"" he told the BBC. Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 after troops opened fire, and another died of his injuries some months later. John Teggart, whose father was killed in the 1971 Ballymurphy shootings, also said the secretary of state should resign. ""What Karen Bradley said is that the soldiers who murdered my father - 14 bullets went through his body, ripped chunks out of his body - that soldier acted in a dignified and appropriate way. ""For Mrs Bradley to come out with insulting, despicable insults to families, it's an absolute disgrace."" 'Their duty' Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney met Mrs Bradley in London on Wednesday evening, during which he intended to discuss her comments. ""The position of the Irish Government is clear,"" his department said. ""There should be effective investigations into all deaths during the Troubles, regardless of the perpetrator."" Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley was responding to a question from DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly about legacy issues. ""Over 90% of the killings during the Troubles were at the hands of terrorists, every single one of those was a crime,"" she said. ""The fewer than 10% that were at the hands of the military and police were not crimes. ""They were people acting under orders and under instruction and fulfilling their duty in a dignified and appropriate way."" 'Offensive and hurtful' SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has also called for Mrs Bradley's resignation. In a tweet, Mr Eastwood wrote: ""Karen Bradley is publically interfering with the rule of law. No-one has the right to deliberately pressure or intervene with due process. She should resign."" Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader Michelle O'Neill tweeted: ""These comments are an insult to families who have lost loved ones at the hands of the British army, state agencies and their proxies in the loyalist death squads which were directed by the British state. ""These offensive and hurtful comments should be withdrawn immediately."" Democratic Unionist Party MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there should not be a one-sided approach to dealing with the past. ""We have been involved in discussions with the government to support our veterans, against the witch hunts against them,"" he said. ""However no-one should be above the law and all innocent victims deserve justice."" Later on Wednesday, Mrs Bradley returned to the chamber to clarify her comments. ""The point I was seeking to convey was that the overwhelming majority of those who served carried out their duties with courage, professionalism, and integrity and within the law,"" she said. ""I was not referring to any specific cases but expressing a general view. Of course, where there is evidence of wrongdoing it should always be investigated whoever is responsible. ""These are of course matters for the police and prosecuting authorities who are independent of government."" 'Odious' The son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane, John Finucane, tweeted that her original comments were ""indefensible"". ""Legally, politically and morally indefensible, yet is it really surprising to hear a [secretary of state] publicly express the contempt we know the British [government] had for lives here?"" Sir Desmond de Silva QC said the state had facilitated Pat Finucane's killing and made relentless efforts to stop the killers being caught in a 2012 review of the murder proposed by the then prime minister David Cameron. Mark Thompson, from victims' organisation Relatives for Justice, said: ""It is absolutely odious and reprehensible that they would stand up and say killings by the state are justified and that they are legitimate."" A sensitive time Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport The latest comments from Karen Bradley come at a particularly sensitive time, as an announcement is expected soon on whether any prosecutions will be brought in relation to the infamous Bloody Sunday killings. Campaigners for victims of state violence in Northern Ireland were quick to slam the secretary of state's comment that the security forces involved in killings were ""fulfilling their duties in a dignified and appropriate way"". Perhaps Mrs Bradley meant to use those words about soldiers and police officers who were found to have acted within the army's rules of engagement, but as she delivered her remarks in the Commons she appeared to be granting absolution to all security force personnel regardless of the circumstances. Whatever the case, there's no doubt that as the Bloody Sunday announcement draws closer, the government is under pressure from many of its own backbenchers and DUP MPs angered over what they regard as a ""witch hunt"" directed at military veterans. Less than an hour after Mrs Bradley spoke, Theresa May was on her feet dealing with the same issue, and confirming that the Ministry of Defence is considering potential legislation designed to ensure - in the prime minister's words that ""service personnel are not unfairly pursued through the courts"". However as those proposals are drawn up, you can expect they will provoke renewed controversy on either side of the debate over Northern Ireland's troubled past. Last year, Theresa May said the system for investigating the past in Northern Ireland was ""unfair"". The prime minister said only people in the ""armed forces"" or ""law enforcement"" were being investigated. However, in 2017, figures obtained by the BBC challenged claims that Troubles investigations unduly focused on those committed by the Army.",Victims' families have called for the Northern Ireland secretary to resign over comments she made about the Troubles.
"The two-week trial, which ends on Saturday, followed concerns raised during summer 2011 after an increase in the number of stranded vehicles. The two electronic signs were placed on the approach to the causeway to advise motorists of the dangers of the tides. Some islanders said they did serve a purpose but they were an ""eyesore"". One of the signs was placed in front of the lay-by where the tide tables are available to check. The second was moved to a range of locations throughout the trial to gauge where it had the most impact. Mike Scott, from Northumberland County Council, said: ""I think our initial view of the trial is that it has had some positive effect. ""I think we have got more lessons to learn and more improvements to make. ""It was only a trial and we've have lots of comments... and we want to take all those on board when we put a more permanent solution in place. ""What we want to do is make sure that tourists, islanders, everybody, has the right information about the dangers of the causeway."" The council said it was hoping to install permanent signs in the summer.

"The surgery stopped at Banbury's Horton General on 18 January, with patients now having to travel to the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Officials said the step was a result of ""unexpected changes"" to staffing. But they refused to give further details about the shortages, citing staff confidentiality rules. Now the Keep Horton General Campaign is calling for the trust to be more open. 'Immensely frustrating' Charlotte Bird, acting campaign chairwoman, said: ""Some people have had to find their own way to the John Radcliffe. ""Many don't have a car, they have had to do it on public transport when they are in pain. ""It's causing the patients extra expense and longer journey times. ""I have pleaded with the trust for openness and transparency. ""It's immensely frustrating. We are being kept in the dark"". Meanwhile a public consultation on plans for the future of Banbury's Horton General Hospital has been delayed. The exercise, which will include plans to expand routine day surgery, will start in May instead of this month due to the local elections. Proposals will include a recommendation for emergency abdominal surgery to be moved permanently to the John Radcliffe Hospital. Health officials said the recommendation for the surgery to move permanently to the John Radcliffe is in-line with national guidance from the Royal College of Surgeons. An average three patients a day who would have been assessed at the Horton have had to travel to Oxford instead since the surgery was suspended there. The trust has given reassurances that paediatrics, obstetrics and the emergency department at the Horton have a ""secure future"" and vowed to involved the local community in its plans. A trust spokeswoman said: ""We are talking to local stakeholders including GPs, MPs, local councillors and the Community Partnership Network about a new timetable. ""We will continue to engage with the local community prior to starting an official consultation in May"".","Campaigners claim they are being ""kept in the dark"" over reasons for the suspension of emergency abdominal operations at a hospital."
"In PMQs, Labour's leader read out what he said were leaked messages showing Surrey council's leader negotiating with the government to call off a referendum on the rise. On Tuesday, Surrey County Council restricted the increase to 4.99%, so a referendum was no longer needed. It said ""no deal"" had been offered. Downing Street said all conversations between the government and Surrey had been ""entirely appropriate"" and there was no ""sweetheart deal"". Later, the government said Surrey had asked to take part in the pilot of a new business rates scheme. The proposed 15% rise was mooted by Surrey Council to cover what it said were shortfalls in funding to cover the rising costs of social care. But plans for a referendum - which are triggered if a local authority proposes a council tax rise of 5% or more - were dropped during a full council meeting on Tuesday. Councillors will now consider an alternative budget. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the prospect of such a sharp increase by a Conservative council had ""set alarm bells ringing"" in the government, which feared it would hit the ""just about managing"" group the prime minister has vowed to protect. In the Commons Mr Corbyn said he had seen leaked text messages intended for a Department for Communities and Local Government official called ""Nick"" from the leader of Surrey County Council, David Hodge. Mr Corbyn said: ""These texts read, 'I'm advised that DCLG officials have been working on a solution and you will be contacting me to agree a memorandum of understanding.'"" He asked: ""Will the government now publish this memorandum of understanding and, while they're about it, will all councils be offered the same deal?"" Noting that Chancellor Philip Hammond and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt are both Surrey MPs, Mr Corbyn said: ""But there was a second text from the Surrey County Council leader to Nick - and in the second text it says, 'The numbers you indicated are the numbers I understand are acceptable for me to accept and call off the R.' ""Now, I've been reading a bit of John le Carre and apparently R means referendum. It's very subtle all this."" He added: ""He goes on to say in his text to Nick 'If it is possible that info to be sent to myself, I can then revert back soonest, really want to kill this off.' ""So how much did the government offer Surrey to kill this off and is the same sweetheart deal on offer to every council facing the social care crisis created by this government?"" Deal or no deal? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg The council, and ministers, denied there had been any stitch-up. But hours later the government admitted they had agreed, in theory, that Surrey Council could, like several others, try out keeping all of the business rates they raised from 2018, which could plug the gaps in funding in future. That change is due to be in force across England by 2020. Technically therefore, Surrey Council has not been offered any additional funding. But the prospect of more flexibility over their own income in future could help fill the council's coffers and seems to have eased some of their concerns. But as a solution to easing the pressure on social care across the country now, the idea could fall far short. Read more from Laura Councillor Hodge told the BBC: ""There is no deal with government, there never was. End of story."" The prime minister said: ""The deal that is on offer to all councils is the one that I have already set out."" She added: ""He stands up and constantly asks for more spending, more money, more funding. What he fails to recognise is that you can only spend money on the NHS and social care if you have a strong economy to deliver the wealth that we need."" Mrs May also said of Mr Corbyn: ""He comes to the despatch box making all sorts of claims. Yet again what we get from Labour is alternative facts; what they really need is an alternative leader."" In a statement issued after Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Hodge said: ""Surrey's decision not to proceed with a 15% council tax increase was ours alone and there has been no deal between Surrey County Council and the government. ""However, I am confident that the government now understands the real pressures in adult social care and the need for a lasting solution."" Councils have been allowed to implement a 3% tax increase solely for social care over the next two years to plug the funding gap in this area. That is on top of a discretionary general increase of 2%, making a total of 5% before a referendum is needed. The Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""The government is not proposing extra funding to Surrey County Council that is not otherwise provided or offered to other councils."" It said Surrey had asked to be part of a pilot scheme under which it could keep all of the business rates raised across its area, adding that other councils could also apply to take part. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said he was ""seeking urgent clarification"" about whether Surrey had been ""bought off"" by the government, adding that cities such as Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Birmingham had been hit ""far harder"" by funding cuts.","Jeremy Corbyn has accused ministers of agreeing a ""sweetheart deal"" to ensure a Tory-controlled council dropped plans to raise council tax by up to 15%."
"The force is seeking permission from the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) to open a ""public engagement exercise"" on the future of the buildings. Forty-three of the buildings are currently empty, but the others are still used as a base for police officers or staff. The properties were selected after a review of the entire police estate. Twelve properties are being considered for closure in the Highlands and Islands, as well as nine across north-east Scotland. Staff occupying the 10 buildings that are still being used would be relocated to other permanent facilities, Police Scotland said. The (SPA) is meeting on Thursday to consider the proposal. Police properties under review: According to Police Scotland, 78% of the properties were built before the 1980s, but 22% are less than 20 years old. Some of the buildings have been empty for many years - including those in Portsoy and Dyce in Aberdeen which have been vacant since 2002. Assistant Chief Constable Andy Cowie said the force had inherited a large estate ""based on legacy arrangements"", with many buildings not suited to modern policing. ""There are a large number of properties currently empty, or soon to become empty, however they still have associated running costs. Such a position does not provide best value or help achieve financial sustainability,"" he said. BBC Scotland learned last November that the future of dozens of police stations across the country was under threat. The force originally had a list 58 buildings it was considering for closure as part of a review of estate strategy established in 2015. Consultation process It said then that the move could generate annual revenue savings of between Â£5m and Â£18m a year and property sales could raise up to Â£34m for the force. A total of 397 properties were operated by the force in 2013 and since then 44 have been declared surplus to requirements. If the SPA approves the decision, Police Scotland would begin a three-month consultation process with staff, local communities and partners. The outcome of this would be fed back to the SPA board before any further action could be taken. Assistant Chief Constable Cowie added: ""No decision will be made on the future of any of our police stations until we have carried out this engagement process. ""Indeed, the final list of properties being considered for disposal may be amended as new needs or opportunities are discovered or offered during the engagement process.""

"Paul Kenny told the BBC that Labour leader Ed Miliband's ""bold move"" was ""as close as you can get"" to ending the link between Labour and the unions. He predicted a fall in Labour funding. Mr Miliband wants union members to have to actively opt in to join Labour, rather than being automatically affiliated as part of union membership. Mr Kenny said the move could see a 90% drop in the number of GMB members affiliating to the party. The union says its affiliation fees paid to Labour could drop from around Â£2m a year to less than Â£1m as a result of the changes. Mr Kenny, its general secretary, said the union would decide whether to ballot its members on whether they still want to give money to Labour in September - meaning the funding cut could happen as early as next year. Under the current system members are given the chance to vote on a union's political fund every 10 years. But Mr Miliband said on Tuesday he would end the automatic ""affiliation"" fee paid to Labour by three million union members and people should not pay Labour any fees ""unless they have deliberately chosen to do so"". The changes would have ""massive financial implications"" for the party, he acknowledged, but could raise its membership from the current 200,000 to a ""far higher number"". The announcement came after Unite, one of the party's biggest donors, was accused of signing up its members to Labour in Falkirk - some without their knowledge - in an effort to get its preferred candidate selected to fight the next election. ""This is an absolute watershed moment - the changes they are about to do will fundamentally change the party's relationship with trade unions and their members,"" Mr Kenny said. 'Insulting' He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that collective affiliation and individual membership were two ""entirely different things"". The union would be ""lucky"" if 10% of the 400,000 members who are currently affiliated to Labour on a collective basis would choose to sign up as individual members, he said. ""We have been trying to encourage our members to join Labour for a very long time - through magazines, meetings and our conference. I have to say we have not been knocked down in a rush. ""The jump will be from currently affiliating the union to argue for people on political policies with the Labour Party to individual membership of the party. Lots of people agree with the first but I am not sure that many people agree with the second. ""If they wanted to, they could join the Labour Party like that now."" Mr Kenny criticised the language he said had been used by some Labour politicians in recent weeks describing it as ""disappointing and insulting"" and said he would not be surprised if some members wanted to disaffiliate from Labour entirely. Gerry Morrissey, the general secretary of media and entertainment union Bectu, which is also affiliated to Labour said he believed Mr Miliband's proposals were ""totally unnecessary"", as members could choose to opt out of the 3p a week payment on their membership forms. If the proposal went through, he said, ""then the Labour Party will lose money"". ""I don't know what percentage of ours would opt in but if you looked at normal ballot procedures etc, I wouldn't be expecting much more than 20-25% of people to be opting in,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. His party has donated more than Â£50,000 to Labour since the general election. Members of both Unite and the GMB recently voted to maintain their political funds. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey has said the union's political levy - worth Â£8m a year to Labour - would ""stay as it is"" and he is happy to discuss the proposals with Labour as the current relationship between the party and the unions is not satisfactory. Mr Miliband's initiative has been welcomed by senior figures in the party, including Tony Blair, who said he wished he had done it when he was party leader.","Plans to change the way union members donate to Labour could ""end rather than mend"" relations, says the leader of the UK's third largest union, the GMB."
"Ahead of negotiations over the EU budget, Mr Miliband told the Sunday Telegraph Labour should not ignore the legitimate concerns of eurosceptics. But the UK needed to stay in the EU and push for reform to the budget, immigration and austerity measures. David Cameron is travelling to Brussels this week for the budget negotiations. In October Labour MPs joined Tory rebels to defeat the government on its strategy to push for a freeze in the budget, instead wanting Mr Cameron to push for a real-terms cut between 2014 and 2020. The prime minister has insisted a real-terms freeze is more realistic, but he has threatened to use the UK's veto if the rise proposed by the European Commission is not drastically reduced. Labour's decision to vote for an EU budget cut was seen as evidence that the party is repositioning itself on Europe towards a more eurosceptic position, but Mr Miliband insisted his party could be at once a keen supporter of EU membership and campaign for reform. 'Change is coming' Mr Miliband told the newspaper: ""Too often people have assumed that we have got to make the rise of euroscepticism about the mythology of bendy bananas and bans on chocolate, not the fact that the European budget looks like it's suited to the 1950s and not the 21st century. ""What I would say is - never shrink from being open about the problems of the European Union."" He would not commit to a future referendum on the UK's relationship with the EU, adding there were genuine concerns the UK could ""sleepwalk"" into exiting the group. The prime minister has been under pressure from his own MPs to promise an in/out referendum on the EU after the next general election in 2015. An opinion poll published in the Observer found more than half of British voters (56%) would vote to leave the EU if a referendum was held. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said his party could still be pro-European and argue for reform. 'Bring back powers' He said: ""We are very proud of Britain's role in Europe in recent decades and the fact we have seen peace and prosperity in a continent twice in the 20th century"" ""But it doesn't help the pro-European case to suggest the status quo does not need change - change is coming to Europe and that is why we will remain a pro-European, pro-reform party, taking a hard headed view of what Europe does well and what Europe does badly. ""Frankly we see the future as Britain being reforming in Europe, not exiting from Europe, and there is a growing number of Conservatives who believe the latter is the way forward."" He dismissed as ""nonsense"" a call by senior Tory MP David Davis for a double referendum - one to approve a list of powers for the UK to seek to seize back and then an in/out public poll. Mr Davis, a former Europe minister, said the first vote should be held within a year, before the next elections to the European Parliament in 2014. ""We have got to, somehow, dramatically change our relationship with Europe. Not a little bit of a power here and a little bit of a power there. We have got to bring back lots of powers,"" he said.","Labour should not shrink from ""being open about the problems"" of the EU and should back a ""hard-headed"" approach to reform, Ed Miliband has said."

"By Bethan Bell & Trystan JonesBBC News Its underground platforms, lack of natural light and general aura of grimness even inspired online hate groups, while one magazine poll in 2003 voted it the UK's ugliest single building. Now, the Birmingham city centre station has undergone a Â£600m metamorphosis as part of a wider Â£750m revamp of the area. But is the new station a return to the glory days of its 19th Century origins or simply to dazzle commuters? Live updates from redeveloped station When it opened in 1854, New Street featured the largest iron and glass roof in the world. It allowed light to stream in and prompted praise. Author George Borrow, for example, wrote the station ""alone is enough to make one proud of being a modern Englishman"". A decade later, Bradshaw's Guide wrote of ""broad stone staircases"" lined with bronze rails leading passengers down to platforms, and said the roof deserved special attention. ""The semicircular roof is 1,100 feet long, 205 feet wide and 80 feet high, composed of iron and glass and, without the slightest support except that afforded by the pillars on either side,"" the guide said. But, the magnificent roof was damaged beyond repair in German bombing raids during World War Two and the station was eventually buried, within its 1967 concrete-reworking. Now, for the first time since that entombment, natural light is flooding in to the atrium, while the concrete facade has been replaced by gleaming steel panels. Philip Singleton, architect and chief executive of Birmingham's Millennium Point, said the ""sheer scale"" and the amount of light in the new concourse would surprise regular commuters. ""It feels like a breath of fresh air,"" he said. ""The old building was so oppressive. Arriving and departing from New Street has been really a depressing experience."" Albert Bore, leader of Birmingham City Council, said the new concourse would create a ""vibrant, spacious and bright transport hub"" to be ""proud"" of. Illustrating how the transformation is not just cosmetic, he also said it would act as a ""catalyst"" for regeneration and help attract new businesses to the city. The station is the busiest outside London, dealing with more than 170,000 passengers a day, more than double the capacity of the 1960s building. The Office of Rail Regulator estimated 34.7 million people made journeys to or from the station in 2013-14, while yet more passed through on their way to other destinations. As a result, the new concourse is five times larger than its predecessor and designed to cope with up to 52 million passengers a year. The revamp includes two new entrances as well as extra escalators and lifts to platforms, which have been decluttered. Work on platform-level though is set to continue for another year. Construction firm Mace described the project, one of the ""biggest refurbishments in Europe"", as ""demanding, but really successful"". The company said the biggest challenge had been working in a ""live"" railway station, including installing the new roof while thousands of passengers went about their daily journeys. Network Rail said despite the station being one of the busiest in the country, ""very few"" trains had been delayed as a result of the project. Peter Hughes, from campaign group Railfuture, praised the scheme, but wished it could have gone even further. ""The concourse is the most wonderful, dramatic building, but we've always said there's nothing really new at platform level - no extra track and no longer trains,"" he said. ""The problem is that we're constrained by the narrowness of the site. In a few years new rolling stock should make a real difference, but it's always 'jam tomorrow'."" Before the construction of the Bullring shopping centre, Mr Hughes said there had been an opportunity to allow a little more room for New Street to expand and possibly even add one or two extra lines. He said another, earlier option had been to turn the derelict Curzon Street station into Birmingham's main hub, until that was adopted as a terminal for the planned HS2 high-speed rail line. However, Mr Hughes said the central location of New Street was one of its strengths, even if it restricted development of the actual rail infrastructure. ""It's one of the most central stations in any English city. The designers and engineers have done a great job, especially as its continued to be used by passengers,"" he said. The project has not been without its problems. Original designers AZPML and its lead architect Alejandro Zaero-Polo, pulled out of part of the project last year in a row involving materials. Cramped conditions during the revamp also played a role in the station being named the UK's worst in a survey last year, by rail watchdog Passenger Focus.","For decades, disembarking at New Street railway station could be likened to stepping into a dimly-lit concrete box filled with foetid air."
"The body of India Chipchase, 20, was found under sheeting on a mattress at a house in Stanley Road in Northampton on 31 January. Edward Tenniswood, 52, of Stanley Road, Northampton, denies murder and rape. Christopher Christon saw Ms Chipchase ""stumbling"" across the road near NB's club in Northampton. LIVE: For more on this and other stories from Northamptonshire He told Birmingham Crown Court he was waiting for a lift home with his wife Jacqueline near the club at about 01:00 GMT on Saturday 30 January when he saw Ms Chipchase on her phone. He said: ""She seemed quite distressed. I think she was trying to get through to someone. It seemed like she was crying."" Ms Chipchase was outside the club after she got separated from her friends inside, when at about 01.15 she was approached by a man who the prosecution have claimed was Mr Tenniswood. Mr Christon said he saw an older man wearing a Parka-type jacket and a rucksack get ""all the way up"" to Ms Chipchase and ""put his arm around her"". The witness said he was concerned enough to tell his wife to keep watching, but it did not appear to him that Ms Chipchase responded to the older man in any way during a 20-minute period. Samuel Stein QC, defending, asked: ""Did it look like the girl was ignoring the bloke?"" Mr Christon replied: ""I just think she was that drunk that she didn't know what was going on."" Jurors have heard about DNA and fingerprint evidence from examinations of Mr Tenniswood's rented terrace house in Stanley Road, Northampton, where Ms Chipchase's body was found. Laboratory tests on a cigarette butt discovered in a cup in the kitchen bin found DNA matching only that of Ms Chipchase. The trial continues.","A student who was found raped and murdered after a night out appeared so ""drunk she didn't know what was going on"", a court has been told."
"Speaking on the Sunday Politics Scotland programme, he said ""clarity"" was need before Labour put its case to voters. The Scottish government has, meanwhile, asked for further funding to cope with a possible no-deal Brexit. The UK government said money would be available where Scotland faces disproportionate costs. In his television interview, Mr Leonard called for Labour to say its preference was to remain in the European Union. ""We recognise there are parts of the UK - and the overall result was to leave,"" he said. ""But I do think that we need clarity in our position. ""So you would expect me to be arguing, as I am, that means we need to be clearer in our position going into any public vote."" Mr Leonard added: ""The Scottish Labour party took a decision frankly in the wake of the European party election results that we needed to be much clearer, that we needed much greater clarity about the position that we were taking. ""For that reason the Scottish executive of the Labour party backed my proposal that we call for an affirmative vote that any deal should go back to the public; secondly, that on that vote there should be a remain option; and thirdly, that we would campaign unambiguously for remain."" Contingency fund His comments came as the Scottish government said more money would be needed if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. It has requested Â£52m from a contingency fund to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Money from the EU Exit Operational Contingency Fund has been made available ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union on 31 October. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay reiterated the Scottish government's opposition to any form of Brexit. He also asked that additional costs associated with it are met including those beyond the end of next month. Mr Mackay said: ""The UK government now seems to be actively pursuing a 'no-deal' outcome which is utterly unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs. ""We have requested Â£52m from the UK government's fund to help us prepare for a 'no-deal' outcome. ""This is the minimum requirement for operational activity but the real costs of a 'no-deal' Brexit will massively outweigh these and further funding will be required."" 'Disproportionate costs' He also said leaving the EU was not Scotland's choice and called for any related costs to be covered by the UK government. Mr Mackay added: ""The Scottish government should not have to cut spending on public services to fund Brexit preparations. ""As a responsible government, we are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from a 'no-deal' Brexit and we will set out those plans to parliament shortly but we are facing additional and disproportionate costs to mitigate the impact of such an outcome. ""We will continue make the case for staying in the EU and will stand firm against efforts to take us out against our will."" The request includes funding to support the effect of no-deal on rural communities, increased demand on Marine Scotland and Police Scotland activities, additional communication to EU citizens in the country, and poverty mitigation measures. 'Supporting a deal' A Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: ""In 2016, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. ""Only the Scottish Conservatives have worked to prevent no-deal by supporting a deal. ""The SNP were given Â£92m for our councils to prepare for Brexit. ""Yet there is no evidence Scottish local authorities have received anything at all."" It comes after Scotland's chief economist on Friday predicted a potential Â£2bn loss of investment because of Brexit. Forecasts up to April 2020 in the Scottish government's quarterly State of the Economy Report show Â£500m of investment could be wiped out if uncertainty continues with the figure rising by the end of the year. A spokeswoman for the UK government said: ""We have allocated the Scottish government nearly Â£140m in funding for EU exit preparation. ""We will consider the Scottish government's further bid under the Â£1bn Operational Contingency Fund in the usual way.""",Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said his party should have a clear policy to remain in the EU.
"Five councillors usually represent Casterton, near Kirkby Lonsdale in Cumbria, although it had been managing with four. They recently stood down and there was just a single candidate standing in the local elections on 2 May. South Lakeland District Council has now appointed four of its councillors to the parish council. There will be another election for Casterton Parish Council on 13 June and it is hoped local people will come forward. The council, which looks after issues such as some street lights and play areas, could not act legally with just a single councillor, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 'Some reluctance' Rev Kevin Price, clerk to Casterton Parish Council, said: ""It's a problem happening at many parish councils - I am clerk to 11 and about half of them are short. ""However, in 36 years I can't remember any being down to just one member. ""There does seem some reluctance in the rural community to stand and some do not want the commitment."" People who live within three miles of the parish boundary or who work or own property there can stand, and must register as a candidate by Thursday.",A village parish council had to draft in support from another authority after it was left with just one councillor.
"Wayne Soutter, 43, who now lives and works in England, set off on the North Channel swim at 11:19 BST on Sunday. He came ashore at Kenbane Head between Ballycastle and Ballintoy shortly before 23:30 BST on Sunday. He was then taken to Ballycastle harbour to a welcoming reception. Wayne told Good Morning Ulster why he had decided to embark on the swim and recalled the conditions he encountered. ""I thought it was interesting to try something that had never been done,"" he said. ""I was not afraid before the swim, but about halfway through the swim I really started getting quite scared. ""The tides and the winds were ferocious, there were times the boat was spinning in 180 degree circles. ""The tides were crossing each other and spinning the boat around."" He said he struggled with the cold conditions which he experienced. ""When you get cold, you get depressed and it was so hard,"" he added. ""At one point I was feeling so down, the only way to feel better was to swim harder."" His training had included a one-hour swim off the Northern Ireland coast which had allowed him to gauge currents and test his resilience to jellyfish stings. ""There were times I was in a field of jellyfish, everywhere I looked there were jellyfish,"" he said. ""I just had to put my head down and swim through them it was awful."" Wayne, was raising money for the Community Rescue Service, through his swim. He conquered the English Channel on his first attempt in 2012. Apart from the aforementioned jellyfish, the South African had to battle six feet waves as he approached his destination. The swim should be about 20 km in length if taken in a straight direction, but due to the the nature of the tide it was about 45km.",A South African man has become the first person ever to swim from the Mull of Kintyre in Scotland to the north Antrim coast in Northern Ireland.

In February last year, HSBC opened its new headquarters in Birmingham with 2,000 members of staff. Mr Street said it was another ""major company"" moving into the West Midlands and meant BT would become one of Birmingham's biggest employers. He said the Snow Hill area alone was now home to the likes of HS2 Ltd, KMPG, Barclays, and law firm Gowling. ""I am delighted that a firm of BT's size and stature has made this move, and it shows just how far our region has come in recent years that the UK's biggest companies now see a profitable future in the West Midlands,"" Mr Street said.

The pups were underweight and in desperate need of help when they were found. Assistant manager Matt Yeadon said it was satisfying to see them go after being nursed back to health. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire Donald - a common seal - who was named after the US president due to the Trump-like fur on his head, and Dennis - a grey seal - were released back into the North Sea earlier. Mr Yeadon said the seals would probably stick together for a while as they had spent the past few months together. He said it was then likely they would go their separate ways.

"Nicola Sturgeon was responding to a Labour proposal to freeze fares in order to ""give passengers a break"". ScotRail's regulated fares are due to rise in January. The increases would see a passenger using an annual season ticket to travel between Edinburgh and Glasgow having to pay Â£71 more next year. Speaking at First Minister's Questions, Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale highlighted fresh disruption at Glasgow Central station on Thursday morning, with a points failure leading to delays and cancellations. It came the day after ScotRail declared a major incident after finding a broken insulator between Partick and Glasgow Central, which caused disruption and cancellations between Glasgow Central and Dalmuir, Milngavie and Maryhill. 'Deserve a break' Ms Dugdale said: ""I think passengers deserve a break and that is why today Labour is publishing plan to freeze all regulated rail fares next year. ""Surely the first minister agrees with us that people deserve a break. She has the power to give them one. So will she back Labour's call for a 2017 rail fare freeze?"" Labour has said it believes the proposal will cost between Â£1.9m and Â£2.2m. Ms Sturgeon responded by saying that ""of course we will consider any proposal that is put forward"", but added that the government would particularly look at how the proposal would be paid for. She added: ""We have an investment package that I have spoken about that it is important that we are able to implement and deliver. ""Of course we do not want to see rail fares increase any more than is absolutely necessary. That is why we at the moment have increases in rail fares that are at their lowest level since power over railways were devolved to this parliament in 2005. ""We see peak time rail fare increases limited to inflation. Off peak rail fair increases are actually limited to inflation minus one percent."" Dutch firm Abellio took over the ScotRail franchise in April last year in a 10-year deal worth up to Â£6bn but with the option for the Scottish government to cancel it at the halfway point. ScotRail's figures remained better than the average for all UK train operators - with the company also enjoying better than average customer satisfaction figures when the latest data was published earlier this year. But its contract commits ScotRail to ensuring that 91.3% of trains arrive within five minutes of schedule, which is the UK standard for punctuality. The latest figures suggests ScotRail is currently achieving 89.8% over the past year and 86% over the last month - lower than the target, but slightly above the UK average. The Scottish government has said that performance is not good enough, and ScotRail was ordered to implement an improvement plan last month which has not yet been made public. 'ScotRail fleet' But after being pressed on the issue by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that ScotRail would publish the 246-point plan in full within the next few days. She added: ""There is a summary of all of these action points that is already on ScotRail's website that any member of the chamber, and member of the public indeed, can read. ""What they cover are improvements to infrastructure, improvements to the Scotrail fleet and improvements to operations. ""And of course all of this is backed by an investment of Â£5bn over the remainder of this decade in improving our rail services."" Ms Davidson claimed the rail network had been a ""shambles"", and questioned why it had taken the Scottish government a month to reveal what it was doing to improve services. She also questioned Ms Sturgeon on the Scottish government's plans to prepare a public sector bid for the ScotRail franchise when the current contract ends. Ms Sturgeon said the SNP had made a manifesto commitment to preparing a public sector bid, thanks to recently devolved powers, and would now start making plans to ensure that is possible.",Scotland's first minister has said she will consider freezing the country's train fares next year amid concern over the reliability of ScotRail services.
"Ian Cobb, a 48-year-old grandfather from Wool in Dorset, fell seriously ill with Covid-19 at the start of April. His family said they had ""feared the worst"" but Mr Cobb left intensive care on 3 June, the date of his wedding anniversary and his wife's birthday. They added that it was ""the best present we could have asked for"". Mr Cobb was diagnosed in 2014 with amyloidosis, an incurable condition that led to him requiring a heart transplant in the same year. It also resulted in him needing a bone marrow transplant and regular chemotherapy. He started developing coronavirus symptoms while he was being treated for unexplained spinal fractures in hospital and was discharged by doctors who believed he would be safer at home. However, he started experiencing breathing difficulties and was readmitted three days later. Danielle Thompson, his stepdaughter, said it felt like ""being hit in the gut"" when the family received the news that he had been put on a ventilator. ""It was a case of hoping for the best but preparing for the worst,"" she said. ""I had it in my head that that was it - that we weren't going to speak to him again, that he wasn't going to wake up."" 'Spread some positivity' She said the family experienced ""a lot of ups and downs"" as doctors explained that they would not be able to save him if his organs began to fail. However, he became stronger when doctors took him off the ventilator and was applauded by staff at Poole Hospital as his bed was wheeled out of the intensive care unit. Mr Cobb has now been able to sit up and talk to his family on the phone and is looking forward to hearing when he will be allowed home. ""He proved us all wrong - it's a miracle,"" said Mrs Thompson.

"The Duke of Edinburgh, who died on 9 April, has left a huge legacy with his award scheme. According to the latest statistics, more than 1.3 million young people participated worldwide in 2018. And in the UK, more than 490,000 people were taking part as of March 2020. Bill Cosgrave, from Oxfordshire, believes he was about the sixth person ever to receive a silver Duke of Edinburgh's Award. He was a 17-year-old orphan and boy soldier in the Army's Junior Infantry Battalion in Plymouth when he was selected to take part in 1958. As a war baby who had lived in orphanages until he was 14, Bill says the tasks - which included a visit to a nearby girls' school to be taught cookery - allowed him to spend useful time with the opposite sex. ""Being institutionalised within a male environment, I totally lacked any understanding of the female influences on life,"" he says. ""With their helpful advice, coupled with the enjoyment of their company, this played quite an educational part my life. ""As an orphan, I have much to thank the duke for, giving me the opportunity at the right time."" Also in 1958 - just two years after Prince Philip first established the scheme - Jeff Bryson received his gold award - the highest and most challenging level - and he is convinced that it helped him later to get jobs with the Met Office and the Metropolitan Police. Jeff's secondary school arranged the opportunity and among the array of tasks he completed was a fireman's course, a camping expedition along the Exmoor coast and applying ointment to an elephant's injured thigh at Whipsnade Zoo. Meeting the duke was ""one of the highlights of my life,"" says Jeff, 80, from near Crewe. He had just lost his father when he received the award, but his mother accompanied him to the Palace. ""When asked what was the best thing about the visit, I remember her saying, 'The ladies' toilets in Buckingham Palace - they were beautiful',"" he recalls. Within a couple of years of its launch, the award was widened to include girls. ""There were separate awards for girls and boys in those days, with different options offered,"" says Susan Wilsdon, from Thurrock, in Essex, who began her award in 1962. Susan achieved her gold by 1968 and later ran the awards scheme locally. Her love of it has been passed down through her family: both her daughter and granddaughter have achieved gold and another granddaughter is working on her bronze. ""I've met Prince Philip many times and he was a bit of a joker,"" she says. Malcolm Wood has similarly fond memories of meeting Prince Philip, recalling that he was ""a very easy person to talk to"". ""You'd be as nervous as anything and as soon as he started talking, all your nerves would go away,"" says Malcolm, now 71, who completed his silver award as an air cadet in the late 1960s. Malcolm, who did cycling and gliding as part of the scheme, credits the award for landing him his first job at a finance company at the age of 16. ""At the interview they said, 'There's quite a few applicants. Tell us a bit more about the Duke of Edinburgh's Award'. ""I can't prove it, but I'm pretty convinced it was a factor in my getting the job,"" he adds. Malcolm went on to spend 40 years in the civil service and was appointed an MBE. Another air cadet who completed the scheme, albeit two decades later, is Lyndon Davies, from Cardiff, who went on to achieve gold in 1989. The duke was ""a major influence on my life,"" says Lyndon. ""The principles of that award have stayed with me throughout my life in so many ways and I would not be the person I am without that influence."" He adds: ""I remember the pride when I attended St James's Palace to receive my award and met the duke."" For Rebecca and David Magee, the award changed the course of their lives immeasurably. They met as 16-year-olds on a silver Duke of Edinburgh's Award expedition to the Peak District in 2002. They married and are now expecting their first child. ""[We] would never have met if we hadn't shared an excitement and curiosity about the outdoors which was enabled by the DofE scheme,"" says Rebecca, now 34. ""We became friends immediately and a couple 12 years later. ""We now have a baby girl on the way who would not have existed were it not for the DofE - a very strange thought. ""It turned out to be one of the most important moments of our lives, and that is why we have the date of that DofE expedition carved into our wedding rings."" Despite beginning in the UK, the award is now operating in more than 130 countries. Dr Michaela Musilova, from Slovakia, is patron of the award scheme in her home country after completing gold as a university student in London in 2009. She is now an astrobiologist, working on the slopes of a volcano in Hawaii, where she leads simulated space missions to the Moon and Mars. She says the skills learnt doing the award help her every day - and she draws comparisons between the challenges and analog space missions. ""You just have to persevere. Even when everything is breaking [and] people are arguing, you just have to keep going,"" she says. Michaela, 32, also values the volunteering opportunity. ""I always felt very grateful for all the support I had over the years. I felt a need to give back because I was helped in so many ways, especially by charities."" In Sri Lanka, marine conservation activist Shanjeevan Amalanathan, 20, is currently working towards his gold award through a community group. He loves adventure - he walked the entire length of the country in 12 days and is dreaming of doing the seven-summits challenge, which involves climbing the highest mountains on every continent. ""The award made me what I am today,"" he says. When the pandemic hit, Shanjeevan volunteered to help the local government with its response. And he believes that if he had not learnt about marine conservation during award challenges, such as beach clean-ups, he would not have ended up as an environmental campaigner. He says the award gives people ""full freedom"" to design their own programmes. ""In Sri Lanka, most of the parents want their children to be a doctor, lawyer, engineer or businesspeople,"" he says. ""We should think out of this box. There are so many things to be done. Do what you really are."" Eighteen-year-old Amy Scott, from Essex, is also one of this generation's award-holders. Over the last four years she has achieved her bronze and silver awards and is planning to complete her gold when the pandemic ends. ""Obviously [Covid] has really put a spanner in the works,"" she says. ""I miss that community aspect. I have a part-time job and that's fun, but I miss being able to give back. ""The DofE award is a fantastic endeavour. If I'm going to do bronze and silver, I might as well go all the way. That's something bronze and silver taught me: what is the point of stopping at stage one?""

"Peter Bucklitsch said on Twitter that the boy was ""well clothed and well fed"" and died because his parents were ""greedy for the good life in Europe"". His remarks had been condemned by MPs and a UKIP spokeswoman said they did not represent the party's views. Mr Bucklitsch told the BBC he was sorry ""for the evident distress"" caused. 'Inelegant' Mr Bucklitsch's tweets were in response to photographs of three-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who was found lying dead on a beach in Turkey after drowning when the boat he and his family were travelling on to Greece sank. The images sparked an international outcry over the human cost of the migrant crisis. Mr Bucklitsch, who stood for UKIP in Wimbledon at the May 2015 election, wrote: ""Queue jumping costs."" He added: ""Predictable unthinking outrage. Turkey is not a place where the family was in danger. Leaving that safe place put the family in peril."" His comments - which have since been deleted from his Twitter account - drew criticism from UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, who said it was a ""grotesque and awful"" thing to say. Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron tweeted that Mr Bucklitsch - who previously stood as a candidate for the party at the 2010 election - had showed an ""appalling lack of compassion"". The Lib Dems said he was expelled from the party after standing for the Conservatives in Wealden council elections a year later. Contacted by the BBC, Mr Bucklitsch said: ""I apologise for the evident distress this caused, and have removed it. ""It was an inelegant way of agreeing that the problems lie in the regions where conditions precipitate such a strong desire to reach a place where life can begin again."" He said the image of the boy had upset him but admitted that ""to lash out at the parents who were trying to do their best was not, on reflection, the best answer"". But he warned: ""Forcing migrants of all descriptions to pay people smugglers to get them into the EU illegally will continue to be the problem, and will inevitably cause death and misery on a large scale."" A spokeswoman for UKIP said Mr Bucklitsch was not a party candidate or an officer and that his opinions on social media ""in no way represent the views of the party"". Asked if he would be prevented from standing for the party again, the spokeswoman said she would expect so, adding: ""We've got pretty good vetting procedures.""",A former UKIP parliamentary candidate has apologised for blaming the death of a Syrian boy found drowned on a Turkish beach on his parents' greed.
"The council has approved a ""Public Spaces Protection Order"" to ban the use and supply of legal highs in public areas across the whole borough.

The government plans to ban the sale of legal highs, which would include nitrous oxide. The new rules in Lambeth have been introduced as a result of a number of complaints made to the council over the past year regarding laughing gas. It said there had been 57 police incidents connected with legal highs in the borough over the past 12 months, including robbery, theft, anti-social behaviour and sexual assault. Councillor Jane Edbrooke said: ""Legal highs are simply not safe - we saw that just days ago with the death of a teenager who had inhaled laughing gas. ""It is our duty to keep our residents safe and this new order should deter people from supplying and using legal highs in the borough. The rules come in to force in Lambeth on 17 August.

"Bosses had applied to remove protected property status from its Heatherwood Hospital site in Ascot, Berkshire. Windsor and Maidenhead council raised fears that moving services to a smaller site would impact on patients. Independent NHS regulator Monitor threw out the plans after the NHS trust failed to provide key information. The trust said it was disappointed. Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust is desperately trying to make savings. It recently announced about 100 beds could be cut at Slough's Wexham Park Hospital by the end of the year and it is to receive an Â£18m loan from the government. The trust had highlighted land and buildings it deemed surplus to requirements at Heatherwood and said it could relocate services, including mental health and social services, to its other sites. It did not reveal what it planned to do with the land if the status was removed but said it was unhappy with the decision. In a statement the trust said: ""Monitor had sought more information to support the proposal, which the trust was unable to provide as it concerns decisions that will form part of the trust's turnaround plan going forward, and therefore the information is not yet available. 'Jeopardise future' ""The trust is on track to deliver its turnaround plan to return the organisation to financial balance."" The council said it understood the need for the trust to make savings and would try to help, but not at the expense of services. Councillor Simon Dudley, deputy leader of the council, said: ""Removal of the legal protection could have ultimately jeopardised the future of the hospital. ""We heartily welcome the regulator's decision. It is excellent news for our residents as it achieves the outcome pushed for by the council - the protection of local services.""

"By Kris Holland & Craig LewisBBC News ""It's the worst-case scenario for us,"" says launderette owner Lee Judges. Mr Judges, whose Impressive Dry Cleaners business has been a feature of the town centre for 10 years, says the coronavirus pandemic has been ""a complete and utter nightmare"". The south Hertfordshire districts of Broxbourne, Hertsmere, Three Rivers and Watford will move into England's highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions, alongside London and parts of south Essex, from 00:01 GMT on Wednesday. It comes at the same time as a new strain of the virus has been detected in south-east England. Broxbourne itself has been one of the areas worst hit nationally for Covid-19 cases. In the week up to 10 December, the infection rate was 446 cases per 100,000 people. Mr Judges says the dry cleaning business has suffered throughout 2020 - with fewer clothes requiring cleaning as people stopped working from offices, weddings were cancelled and Christmas parties taken online. ""It's not realistically worth being open,"" he says. ""We were just starting to get back a little bit normal before the last lockdown, but tier three is going to stop people going out."" Mr Judges says something needs to be done to stop Covid in its tracks - ""it is rife at the moment"" - but adds businesses were struggling due to a lack of the government grants that propped them up during the first lockdown. ""The High Street is very vibrant normally,"" he says. ""This has been a really good business, but it's on its knees. ""I was thinking, just get over Christmas and maybe things are going to start to pick up, but now we are in tier three. The uncertainty is killing us."" 'Something missing' from my life' The move to tier three also means the end of crowds at live sport events. Watford FC, about 28 miles (45km) from Broxbourne, have been able to invite up to 2,000 fans to home games in recent weeks. This will be the case later when they host Brentford, but after that it will be back to playing in front of an empty stadium. Justin Beattie, who runs the Do Not Scratch Your Eyes podcast with fellow Hornets fan Carl James, says: ""It is something missing from my life. ""Fans are really frustrated."" Mr Beattie was drawn out of the ballot to attend Watford's game with Rotherham last week and said he was sat five seats away from anyone else. ""I can understand why they are doing it, but it seems silly when the stadium can hold 20,000 people,"" he says. 'It will be like cutting their wings' Town centre shopper Marta Kulza says the government has been caught between imposing restrictions to curb the virus and keeping businesses open which might otherwise ""die after a while of being shut"". She says entering tier three just before Christmas would be ""really hard"". ""That is the time when owners are usually earning more money,"" she says. ""For them it will be like cutting their wings. ""We have to behave, even though it is Christmas and family time. It's good to follow the instructions. ""It's really hard for some people, like being in a cage. You cannot travel to discover anything."" 'I've been in the overdraft for two months' The Highland Steakhouse & Carvery has been in Jimmy Demetriou's family since 1974. He took over the business in April last year, but 2020 and Covid-19 have seen restrictions shed the restaruant of two-thirds of its capacity. Jimmy is critical of the government's tier system and the rules which controlled the second lockdown. ""It didn't really seem we were in lockdown apart from the fact you couldn't go out to eat at a restaurant,"" he says. ""Prior to the lockdown we were in tier one, then we ended up in tier two. The tier system was a failure and the lockdown was a failure."" He adds: ""Being in tier two meant all the friends who would usually have come out for a Christmas party couldn't. We are left with single-family households, and now in tier three we can't even have that. ""We do a little bit of takeaway, but essentially we are not a takeaway restaurant. ""I've pretty much been in the overdraft for the last month or two. We just aren't getting enough customers to boost the bank account."" What are tier three (very high) rules? 'I worry for young people' At Broxbourne Station, artist Chris Hoggins has just returned from the south coast where he has been working. He says the increased restrictions would not significantly change his life. ""I lead an incredibly quiet life,"" he says. ""I don't go out much and I feel bad because it doesn't affect me that much. ""It's the young people I worry about. They want to go out and do things, and it's scuppered."" Mr Hoggins, who has written a book about coronavirus, called Covid Visual Diaries, says he had been surprised by how different people were affected by different things.

"They had five contracts in four areas - south, east and west Belfast and Newtownabbey - to carry out repairs and provide fast response maintenance teams for a range of repairs. The company has been working with the executive since 2004. A BBC investigation discovered a number of executive tenants who were unhappy about the level of service. They were not content about the standard of repairs carried out to their homes. One woman who was compensated after Red Sky did some work on her house, said her home was wrecked by the people who were supposed to repair it. The investigation also uncovered evidence that Housing Executive staff repeatedly raised concerns about the company's standards of work, primarily in west Belfast. The Housing Executive said it would be putting in place the necessary arrangements to provide response maintenance services to its tenants. ""Red Sky Group has five separate contracts covering Housing Executive districts in Belfast and Newtownabbey,"" the Housing Executive said.",Red Sky was one of the main contractors used by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
"Pontypridd AM Mick Antoniw and MP Owen Smith want Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) council to oppose proposals for Moy Road Industrial Estate at Taffs Well. They claim its biggest employer, Rhys Davies Logistics, would have to move. The plans are by Delyn Properties LLP and Castell International Ltd, which could not be contacted for comment. An application has been made to redevelop the site to create offices, homes, a residential care home, pub and restaurant, and an extension to Taffs Well railway station park and ride facilities. Rhys Davies Logistics, which has a staff of about 150, is a tenant on the land and is not part of the application. Nobody at the company was available to comment. In a letter to the council, the politicians claim local businesses and residents are concerned about the proposals. The letter says that ""it is highly likely that if [Rhys Davies Logistics] were to relocate its head office, it would be to another area of the UK, and almost certainly not within Wales, let alone RCT"". It adds: ""As well as the loss of quality jobs on the Moy Road site - it is estimated that around 250 people are employed by the firms in the area the developers have earmarked for housing - it is difficult to see any benefit to the Taffs Well community elsewhere in the plans."" The politicians also say: ""We appreciate there is a need for extra housing in Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""However, we feel that this particular proposal is not the answer. ""Housing developments should not put at risk the jobs of 250+ local people, or misappropriate land which is ideal for existing businesses to develop - particularly when public money has been invested into road schemes aimed at enhancing that development.""",A council has been urged by local politicians to reject plans for development on an industrial estate they say could threaten up to 250 jobs.
"Each handmade 12-inch model represents one of the 72,396 British Commonwealth serviceman killed at the Somme with no known grave. The figures go on public display at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park from Thursday to commemorate the centenary of Armistice Day. Volunteers and members of 1 Royal Anglian Regiment have taken three days to lay out the figures in formation across more than 4,000 sq m in the shadow of the London Stadium. Artist Rob Heard, who spent the last five years hand-crafting each one, said: ""These were individuals, not just a huge number. And that's so often forgotten. ""It came from trying to physicalise the large numbers that just trip off tongue."" In total, more than one million soldiers were killed or wounded during the 1916 Battle of the Somme. The battle, fought in northern France, lasted more than five months and became one of the bloodiest of the First World War. Mr Heard told BBC Radio London he started the project to help him recover from surgery following a traffic accident that left him with limited mobility and continuous pain in his right arm. He said: ""It started from a rather dark place, but it is good recovery for me."" The installation has toured the country after launching four years ago, focussing on the 19,240 who were killed on the first day of the Somme. The Olympic Park exhibit is free and open to the public until 18 November.",Tens of thousands of shrouded figures are being laid out at London's Olympic Park to mark the centenary of the end of World War One.
"The child, from Northampton, was also beaten and made to sleep next to his brother on a filthy mattress with the springs sticking out, it was said. Northampton Crown Court heard he was not fed properly and survived on leftovers. His parents, who cannot be named, deny multiple charges of child cruelty between 2012 and 2016. Prosecutor Grace Hale told jurors that he was kept in a room that locked from the outside and had an alarm fitted. Giving evidence, one of the brothers said their parents ""treated us all the same"" and if anyone was hurt, it was only through ""play-fighting"". Asked about his relationship with his father, the youngster said: ""I loved him and he loved me. We had a very strong relationship. He treated me very well."" When Ms Hale questioned why what he was saying in court was different to what he told police after they visited the family home, he replied: ""I was saying stuff happened that didn't."" The trial continues.","A boy was forced to defecate on the floor after being locked in a room ""not fit for a human"", a court has heard."
"They have reopened a slipway at Connah's Quay to allow boats access to the Dee estuary and have just signed a lease with the council to maintain it. Now they are planning a festival later this month with pleasure boat trips, as ferries once operated across the Dee. They hope to use the event to gain more support for the plans to regenerate the docks and celebrate their importance. Fisherman set up the Quay Waterman's Association (QWA) in 2010 to try to reopen the slipway, giving access to the Dee from Connah's Quay Dock Road. The group's ambition is to increase the use of the docks, as well as reflecting the part the port played in Deeside's history, having this week signed a 25-year lease with Flintshire council. The QWA has also become a social enterprise company which is not for profit and can bid for funding. They want to reopen the closed former sea cadets' building for community groups as well as a heritage centre. ""We have a treasure here and we need to start using it,"" said Keith Marland, chair of QWA. Connah's Quay's port has a history spanning 500 years, but its demise came in the 1960s and the slipway access to the Dee was eventually lost. But the QWA group was spurred into action following the restoration of nearby Green field docks in 2010. Dock Road marks one of the first stopping off points along the 870 mile (1400km) All Wales Coast Path after leaving the English border at Chester. The QWA hopes to sign a lease with the former cadets' building owners, Flintshire council, to renovate it as a community centre and heritage centre. Britain's last three-masted topsail schooner, known as the Kathleen and May, was built at the docks in 1900 and became famous in the 1970s BBC TV drama The Onedin Line. It is currently docked at Liverpool. Mr Marland said members are organising the River Dee Festival on 23 September to show the wider community their plans at the docks. The family fun day includes short boat trips along the Dee beneath towering Flintshire Bridge which straddles the estuary next to Connah's Quay Power Station. A ferry service called Queen's Ferry operated at nearby Queensferry in the late 1800s.",Fishermen are hoping to open a heritage centre in the next phase of a revival of a Flintshire docks.
"The RMT is seeking legal advice over the letter, which was from Southern's parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR). It says GTR will withhold pay unless conductors have worked or will work normally during the dispute. ""We feel we cannot make these payments to conductors who are currently taking industrial action,"" the rail firm said. RMT members are due to begin a 48-hour strike on the Southern network from midnight, in a dispute over the introduction of driver-only operated (DOO) trains. The letter says: ""As the dispute over conductors and DOO is ongoing and your members continue to breach their contracts by taking strike action, thereby causing significant loss to the business and disruption to our customers, we will (without prejudice to our rights) withhold payment of any backdated holiday pay from conductors. ""Any conductors who have either worked normally during the dispute, or confirm that they will now work normally during the remainder of the dispute and will not participate in further industrial action, will receive payment... ""Failing that, GTR intends to make the appropriate payment to employees of this grade in the pay run on 30 December 2016, subject to the current dispute being concluded and no further strike dates being called."" RMT general secretary Mick Cash said Southern had made the dispute ""personal against their own staff"" and added: ""They have declared war on their passengers and staff alike."" He said the letter was sent to the union for the RMT to forward it to members. A Southern spokesman said passengers had faced 15 days of strikes which had caused ""misery and hardship"", and there were seven more to come. He said the strikes had made calculations of what pay is owed more complicated and added: ""We plan to pay them once the industrial action is over."" RMT strike dates:","Backdated holiday pay is being withheld from conductors on Southern rail if they take part in strikes, according to a letter sent to the RMT union."

"He ""passed away peacefully at 12:25 this afternoon"" at his home in Selsey, West Sussex, friends and colleagues said in a statement. Sir Patrick presented the BBC programme The Sky At Night for over 50 years, making him the longest-running host of the same television show ever. He wrote dozens of books on astronomy and his research was used by the US and the Russians in their space programmes. Described by one of his close friends as ""fearlessly eccentric"", Sir Patrick was notable for his habit of wearing a monocle on screen and his idiosyncratic style. Sir Patrick presented the first edition of The Sky at Night on 24 April 1957. He last appeared in an episode broadcast on Monday. A statement by his friends and staff said: ""After a short spell in hospital last week, it was determined that no further treatment would benefit him, and it was his wish to spend his last days in his own home, Farthings, where he today passed on, in the company of close friends and carers and his cat Ptolemy. ""Over the past few years, Patrick, an inspiration to generations of astronomers, fought his way back from many serious spells of illness and continued to work and write at a great rate, but this time his body was too weak to overcome the infection which set in, a few weeks ago. ""He was able to perform on his world record-holding TV programme The Sky at Night right up until the most recent episode . ""His executors and close friends plan to fulfil his wishes for a quiet ceremony of interment, but a farewell event is planned for what would have been Patrick's 90th birthday in March 2013."" 'Father figure' Patrick Alfred Caldwell-Moore was born at Pinner, Middlesex on 4 Mar 1923. Heart problems meant he spent much of his childhood being educated at home and he became an avid reader. His mother gave him a copy of GF Chambers' book, The Story of the Solar System, and this sparked his lifelong passion for astronomy. When war came he turned down a place at Cambridge and lied about his age to join the RAF, serving as a navigator with Bomber Command and rising to the rank of Flight Lieutenant. But the war brought him a personal tragedy after his fiancee, Lorna, was killed when an ambulance she was driving was hit by a bomb. He never married. Sir Patrick, who had a pacemaker fitted in 2006 and received a knighthood in 2001, won a Bafta for services to television and was a honorary fellow of the Royal Society. He was a member of the UK Independence party and, briefly, the finance minister for the Monster Raving Loony Party, and attracted some controversy for his outspoken views on Europe and immigration. His other TV credits include the role of Gamesmaster in the 1990s computer games show of the same name. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh said Sir Patrick's appearance sometimes aroused as much comment as his astronomy: ""He was six-foot-three, and was once described as having 'an air of donnish dishevelment', with his raised eyebrow, scarcely-brushed hair and poorly-fitting suits. ""His enthusiasm was unstoppable, and on occasions he would talk at 300 words a minute."" Queen guitarist Brian May, who published a book on astronomy written with Sir Patrick, described him as a ""dear friend, and a kind of father figure to me"". He said: ""Patrick will be mourned by the many to whom he was a caring uncle, and by all who loved the delightful wit and clarity of his writings, or enjoyed his fearlessly eccentric persona in public life. ""Patrick is irreplaceable. There will never be another Patrick Moore. But we were lucky enough to get one."" Television presenter and physicist Professor Brian Cox posted a message on Twitter saying: ""Very sad news about Sir Patrick. Helped inspire my love of astronomy. I will miss him!"" The acting director general of the BBC, Tim Davie, said his achievements at the corporation ""were unmatched"", adding that Sir Patrick will be missed by his ""countless fans"". UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ""Since I first met Sir Patrick when he dominated a UKIP stage in 1999, he has been a friend and an inspiration - not only to us in UKIP, but across the country and around the world. Today we have seen the passing of a true great, and a true Englishman."" And Dr Marek Kakula, public astronomer at Royal Observatory in Greenwich, described him as a ""very charming and hospitable man"". ""When you came to his home he would always make sure you had enough to eat and drink. He was full of really entertaining and amusing stories. ""There are many many professional astronomers like me who can actually date their interest in astronomy to watching Patrick on TV, so his impact on the world of professional astronomy as well as amateur is hard to overstate.""","British astronomer and broadcaster Sir Patrick Moore has died, aged 89."
"The North Wales regional leadership board, representing six local authorities, says improving transport infrastructure is key to the long term growth of the region's economy. Train services between Swansea and London are set be electrified by 2018. Welsh ministers and Welsh Secretary David Jones back electrification. The board said future rail investment should include the doubling of the railway line between Wrexham and Chester as well as improved links from the north Wales coast to south Wales and the West Midlands. It said the study aimed to show the economic benefits of improving: Board chairman Dilwyn Roberts, a Conwy councillor, said: ""We believe such a study will help the Welsh government, the Wales Office and the many AMs and MPs who support rail modernisation and electrification in north Wales to make a strong case to the Department for Transport and the Treasury for the very substantial investment that will be required."" The study will be commissioned and published by the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, formed by the six councils - Gwynedd, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Rail electrification in south Wales and the prospect of longer, faster trains, was announced last summer by the Department of Transport. Work to electrifiy the south Wales main line is expected to start sometime between 2014 and 2019. A further Â£350m investment will also see lines from Cardiff to the south Wales valleys electrified.","The case for upgrading the north Wales rail network, including electrification, will be pushed by a study launched by local councils."
"By Bethan BellBBC News Although horses - and some well-endowed giants - are perhaps the most well-known hill figures there are also some more unusual creatures and carvings. A lion stands proudly in Bedfordshire. A kiwi in Wiltshire is a testament to the homesick New Zealand soldiers once stationed nearby. Here are the stories behind some of the enormous symbols which have become part of the country's very fabric. The mane attractions The Uffington Horse, in the Berkshire Downs, is considered the oldest hill figure of them all. Carved in the Iron Age, there has been an unbroken chain of people caring for this prehistoric monument for the past 3,000 years. Soil tests show the horse has been there since between 1200 BC and 800 BC. There are plenty of legends associated with both the figure and with nearby Dragon Hill. There have even been suggestions the horse is in fact a dragon. One tale is that King Arthur will one day wake when England is in peril. When Arthur rouses (although legend has it he fought against the English, so it would seem unlikely), the Uffington horse will rise up and dance on Dragon Hill. A similar creature is featured on old Celtic coins from 150 BC. In fact depictions of horses are fairly common, with at least 24 across Britain - although some can no longer be seen. Historian Dr Mark Hows, who studies hill figures, believes the figure represents the Celtic goddess Epona, protector of horses, and all the other horses are copies of - or at least inspired by - the Uffington original. However, only the Osmington White Horse - a 260ft (79m) figure which prances across the South Dorset Downs - has a rider. It was carved in 1808 in honour of King George III, who was a regular visitor to nearby Weymouth. The figure underwent something of a trial in 1989 when the BBC programme Challenge Anneka decided to restore it - but ended up damaging it. It was properly redone in time for the 2012 Olympics, when it could be seen by television viewers of sailing events held in Weymouth harbour. The rather rude giant One of the most famous hill figures is the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, which Historic England describes as ""bold and anatomically impressive"". The 180ft-tall (55m) turf-cut figure of a naked man waving a club has prompted considerable debate over its origins. Early antiquarians linked him with the Anglo-Saxon deity Helis, while others believe he is the classical hero Hercules. Still others posit he was carved during the English Civil War as a parody of Oliver Cromwell, although he is commonly believed to have some association with a pagan fertility cult. A further layer of mystery was added in the 1980s when a survey revealed anomalies which suggested he originally wore a cloak and was stood over a disembodied head. There has also been a suggestion his significant anatomy is in fact the result of merging a smaller penis with a representation of his navel during a re-cut by the Victorians. The giant has caused a few hot flushes in the past. Prudish politicians led to a version on a brewer's logo having his modesty preserved in a Houses of Parliament bar by the addition of a paper fig leaf. And keeping with a political theme, pranksters recently attached giant letters spelling out ""Theresa"". Another giant Cerne Abbas is not the only place to boast a giant on its hillside. Wilmington in East Sussex has its own ""Long Man"" - but he is a more modest sort than his Dorset cousin. For many years up until the 19th Century, the Long Man was only visible when the sun was in a certain position, but since 1874 its shape has been marked out in yellow bricks. The Sussex Archaeological Society describes him as ""the mysterious guardian of the South Downs"" and says there are many theories about his origin. Some are convinced he is prehistoric, others believe he is the work of an artistic monk from the nearby priory, which would date him from between the 11th and 15th Centuries. Roman coins bearing a similar figure suggest he belonged to the 4th Century and there may be plausible parallels with a helmeted figure found on Anglo-Saxon ornaments. We may never know. Kiwi in camp In 1919, following the end of World War One, officers commanding restless and homesick New Zealand troops wanted a task to distract their men and keep them out of trouble. Perhaps inspired by Wiltshire's large number of chalk hill figures - it has 13 horse figures alone - they despatched the soldiers to carve a kiwi in the hillside above Bulford Military Camp. It was designed by Sgt Maj Percy Cecil Blenkarne from a sketch of a stuffed kiwi specimen in the British Museum. The figure, the body of which measures 1.5 acres (6,100 m sq), was completed shortly before the troops went home. It was then looked after by the Kiwi shoe polish company as an advert, until it was covered during World War Two in case it was used as a landmark by enemy aircraft. Although the carving was neglected and nearly disappeared in the 1970s, it was restored close to its former glory in 1986 by a local scout group - which changed its name to the 1st Bulford (Kiwi) Scouts. It has now been given protected status. Other remnants of military life can be found on Fovant Down, between Salisbury and Shaftesbury, where military insignia are carved. Five of the Fovant Badges were created by soldiers during World War One, including the rising sun of the Australian and Commonwealth Military Forces, the Post Office Rifles and the Devonshire Regiment. The ACMF also had men stationed at the nearby Hurdcott army camp, where they cut a map of Australia. The badges belonging to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and the Wiltshire Regiment were built in the early 1950s by the Fovant Home Guard, while the Royal Corps of Signals cut their badge in 1970 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the corps. A roaring success But to find the largest of England's hill figures, one has to travel to Bedfordshire. The giant 147m (483 ft) long lion was carved in 1933 to indicate the location of Whipsnade wildlife park. Thousands of man hours over 18 months were spent digging the creature out of the hillside with pick-axes. However, the outbreak of World War Two resulted in it being covered up again, amid fears it could help guide German bombers to the nearby towns of Luton and Dunstable. Troops were brought in to help camouflage the landmark with brushwood, nets and manure. After the war the lion was uncovered and spruced up again in 2005. He is now visible for several miles across the Dunstable Downs.","Hill figures, emblazoned like scar tissue across England's undulating landscape, hark back to times when gods were honoured and appeased by grand gestures."
"To be called Birmingham Smithfield, the project involves moving the wholesale market to make way for a major shopping area, tram line and 1,000 homes. Birmingham City Council leader Sir Albert Bore said it would ""drastically improve what the city has to offer"". The ideas are being shown to investors at an international property show and will go to public consultation. The wholesale market was already due to move in 2016. The retail market would remain in the Smithfield development. Birmingham Smithfield A planned Midland Metro tram line, to serve the new HS2 rail terminus and the east of the city, will run along the edge of Birmingham Smithfield development. The new Curzon terminus station for the HS2 high speed rail line. linking the city to London and Manchester, which is expected to open in 2026, will be adjacent to the new development, the city council said. A residential hub is planned between Pershore Street and Barford Street, with 1,000 new homes. The city council said Birmingham Smithfield had ""the potential to become an attractive place to live in the city"". The existing wholesale market will move to a 210,000 sq ft (19,510 sq m) site at The Hub industrial estate in Witton, using Â£40m of Enterprise Zone funding. Some traders said they were relieved after ""more than five years of uncertainty"". However Peter Marshall, of the Wholesale Fresh Produce Association, said there was still some uncertainty about how sales would be affected by moving out of the city centre. History of the wholesale market Marketing Birmingham said funding for the new development would come from Â£275m committed by Birmingham City Council for the City Centre Enterprise Zone. Andy Street, chair of the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership, said the organisation was ""absolutely behind realising huge opportunities such as Birmingham Smithfield"".",A Â£500m plan to regenerate part of the centre of Birmingham has been unveiled by developers.
"By Thomas MagillBBC London News Mildmay Mission Hospital in Bethnal Green, London, has accepted referrals from NHS hospitals across London of patients who have had Covid-19 but no longer need intensive care. The 26-bed unit was made famous by numerous visits from Princess Diana. A drop in NHS referrals led to hospital bosses deciding it may have to close. But on the 25 March, Mildmay bosses were asked if the state-of-the-art facility could be used to treat people who have coronavirus, including patients who are homeless . Three have already been treated and a further seven are due to arrive. ""Our team are extremely happy to be part of this fight against Covid-19,"" said Geoff Coleman, chief executive of the hospital. ""They are used to dealing with challenging clinical situations and this is their home ground,"" he added. The hospital will continue to treat HIV patients in a separate part of the building. ""Every patient has their own room with en-suite facilities, enabling us to isolate patients,"" Mr Coleman said. ""Because our specialty is HIV, we operate in the same way as any infectious disease unit would and our isolation protocols are second to none."" Bosses said the unit will be used to treat coronavirus patients for ""at least the next four months"" and all staff redundancy notices had been withdrawn. With fewer people being diagnosed with HIV, the NHS said significant improvements in treatment and medication meant there was a reduced demand for the type of inpatient care the Mildmay Hospital offered. Although bosses disagree, they hope these recent developments could help secure the long term future of the 153-year-old charity and hospital. Mr Coleman said: ""the hospital has the opportunity to demonstrate we can effectively treat homeless patients, thus opening up a new specialty"". ""If we can prove that we can manage this new group of patients as well as our complex HIV patients then we should be able to secure a future for many years to come,"" he added. The number of people diagnosed with HIV in the UK has dropped substantially in recent years.","The UK's only hospital specialising in HIV care that was set to close has won a reprieve, staying open to treat patients with coronavirus."
"St William's Primary near Norwich did not reopen on Monday, amid safety warnings from teaching unions. Its head teacher, Sarah Shirras, said there was a lack of confidence among staff about reopening. ""I have to make a decision on whether the school is safe on two fronts - [the virus] and if I don't have sufficient staff,"" she said. She said rather than closure being based on ""political advice"", she was acting on ""health and safety"" grounds. 'More discussion' Ms Shirras, who is co-chairwoman of the head teachers' association Educate Norfolk, said she believed the move to higher restrictions under tier four at Christmas should have led to ""much more discussion"" between local and national government about what that would mean for schools. ""It feels we could have made a collective response if we had worked together last week and potentially made a plan to go back as the secondaries [are going to] on the 18th."" She said it was unlikely her school in Thorpe St Andrew would reopen on Tuesday, but they would make a plan to ""bring some certainty to our families and children"". ""At the moment staffing is very complicated. We can't move staff around the school in the way we might have done in the past, and we have to have enough staff to open the school safely,"" she said. She said that the school felt ""safe"" last term, but it still had to close three year groups at different times due to Covid-19. ""We've done everything we can, it now feels we are in a far more serious situation and we've got nothing more we can do to up our game to make the school a safer place than it was,"" she added. She said she was ""notorious for not shutting school"" and had kept it open when they had no heating for seven weeks last year, but she felt staying closed now was ""absolutely the right decision"". The Department for Education said closure should only be a ""last resort"". Chris Snudden, director of learning and inclusion at Norfolk County Council, said about a third of Norfolk's primary schools closed on Monday to allow head teachers to ""take stock of staffing levels and review risk assessments"". ""All schools will have provision for vulnerable youngsters and the children of critical workers by Wednesday at the latest,"" she added.

"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter At his first photocall he set himself up for a bit of gentle mockery, being photographed without his notes, compared to the fat packets of EU documents on the table. Jokes aside, if you talk to him or his team they say they are making good progress, that the negotiations are now properly under way, he is totally on top of his brief - move on, nothing to see here. Last week he did also hint at a note of compromise in the air, outlining potential fixes on the prime minister's apparent red line (getting a bit pink these days?) on European judges, holding out the possibility of creating some kind of looser membership of the EU nuclear agency, Euratom, by ""association"". Mr Davis's allies say that he is totally on top of his brief, and they are optimistic about getting things done in the timetable, although openly the government now admits that there will have to be a period of time for industries to adjust to the new realities. There are 98 UK officials in Brussels this week, so there is certainly now a lot of brain power and civil service time and energy going into making it all work. But talking to several different sources this week, who have been close to the talks, none of whom want to see them fail, some distinctly less optimistic signals have emerged. There is a long list of agenda items, inevitably, and it's complicated, but three broad issues have emerged. 1. There's a sense that the government has just not made enough of the big decisions to allow the talks to really get going. One source told me ""I've got nothing to say"" when talking to EU counterparts, because ministers haven't got to the stage yet of being clear about the detail of what they want. They are still focused on generalities rather than giving directions on the nitty gritty. On the Brexit ""divorce bill"" for example, I'm told the expectation across Whitehall is that it will be somewhere between 30 and 50 billion euros. But rather than the UK actually putting forward what they think might be acceptable, they are hanging back, rather than digging in. 2. There's concern the reticence is because Number 10, in particular, has just not made it clear what they actually want, and where the PM might be willing to compromise. One former minister, exasperated at the lack of progress, believes the only way this process can be salvaged is for the prime minister to start making it plain where she will budge and where she won't, to get on to the front foot, to lead. Their fear, that a shadow of her former self after the election, she doesn't have the political ability left to do so. There is frustration that ministers are still relying on tropes like ""frictionless border"", or ""the days of paying vast sums are over"", rather than pushing on with the details. 3. This lack of pace therefore makes, it's feared, the possibility of crashing out, or the talks breaking down in the autumn more likely. If the Tory party, and more importantly the public, aren't prepared by their leaders for what the eventual compromises could be, whether that is keeping some elements of freedom of movement to guard against economic problems, paying tens of billions to keep trading inside the single market, seeing planes unable to fly across Europe or Chinese ships dock at Tilbury if the deals have not been concluded, they could face a very heavy political price. Senior Tories are well aware that if they mess this up they could be punished for generations. These concerns are not raised by sources because of pessimism about Brexit, or a desire for the whole thing to be stopped. There is plenty of that around SW1, but this isn't it. There are clearly massive opportunities for the UK outside the EU, and huge potential for a different and successful prognosis. But inside government there are fears about the capability of the machine to manage the process without falling short. Whether David Davis took his notes to his meeting with Michel Barnier or not, is not really the point.",David Davis will go back to Brussels on Thursday for the conclusion of the second round of official Brexit talks.
"Mrs McAreavey, 27, from Tyrone, was found dead during her honeymoon at the Legends Hotel in January 2011.

The court was told that a couple staying at the hotel who wanted to make a statement to detectives were not given the opportunity. The trial heard that the residents staying in rooms adjacent to the McAreavey's suite in the complex were not questioned after the murder.

"Ian Stephens, of Cumbria Tourism, said there was a need to ""reassure"" travel firms and ""get the message out businesses are operating as usual"". He said the reopening of the A591 was a ""massive priority"" after a four-mile section between Keswick and Grasmere was closed by a landslide. Some areas were hit by flooding three times in as many weeks in December. Mr Stephens said the impact on visitor numbers was ""still unfolding"". ""We've seen a collapse in forward bookings, which is a very worrying trend,"" he said. ""Accommodation held up reasonably well over the Christmas period. ""As you'd expect there were fewer day trippers around and fewer people in the towns and villages, which has an economic impact, and there's an urgent need to get a positive campaign on the road."" Storm Desmond saw a record amount of rainfall in the county over the weekend of 5 and 6 December, followed by more in the rest of the month. Carlisle, Keswick, Appleby and Glenridding were badly affected, with water deluging homes and shops. Cumbria Tourism launched a social media campaign before Christmas and is continuing to work with Visit Britain and Visit England. ""It's a big job to do,"" Mr Stephens said. ""We're talking to coach and travel operators so they don't change their itineraries. ""There's a big danger of them saying, 'We'll wait and go somewhere else in the UK until things are better in Cumbria,' and we then lose a huge number of bookings across the year.""

"More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency will submit its request to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) later in the year. The move has been welcomed by the RSPB. The wildlife charity hopes the review of the hazard classification of the substance - found on seabirds in two separate instances between January and May - will lead to a ban on discharges at sea. 'Glue-like' substance It is currently legal for discharges of PIB, a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships, to be made when vessels wash out their tanks. However, restrictions include them having to be made further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. An MCA spokeswoman said the reclassification of PIB ""could take some time"" because it is regulated internationally, but added the MCA was ""taking steps to see if things can change"". If approved she said it could affect the way the substance is discharged in the future. The MCA is expected to present a paper to the IMO in either October or November. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation has confirmed a number of European countries, including the UK, have been investigating the discharge of ""high viscosity products"" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. The application by the MCA is expected to be approved unless any of the member states lodges an objection. The RSPB is planning its own campaign strategy on the matter and will give evidence to the government about PIBs at a meeting of the transport select committee in November. It said the substance becomes ""glue-like"" in the sea, covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed ""causing immobilisation, hypothermia, starvation and eventually death"". In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation.",UK maritime chiefs are to ask the international governing body to reclassify a pollutant that affected thousands of birds on the south coast.
"By Dominic CascianiBBC News home affairs correspondent The National Audit Office said the agency responsible for prisoners in England and Wales faced ""substantial financial and operational challenges"". Under the sentencing plans, criminals who pleaded guilty at the earliest chance would have had sentences halved. The Ministry of Justice said officials were still working on future savings. Meanwhile, a separate report has recommended more criminal cases should be dealt with through restorative justice. In its report on prisons, the NAO said the National Offender Management Service had met its immediate 2012 cuts target and had successfully saved money by cutting posts and red tape at its headquarters. But it warned the agency's plan to cut more than Â£2bn by the end of this Parliament was in doubt because the government had abandoned a proposal by former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke to halve sentences for criminals who pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Prime Minister David Cameron said the plan would have been too lenient. The ministry had expected the scheme to save Â£130m a year because there would have been 6,000 fewer inmates, potentially taking the prison population below 80,000. The fall in the prison population would have allowed it to close older and more expensive jails. The ministry now projects that the prison population will fall by only 2,000, based on the more limited measures recently passed by Parliament. Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: ""The National Offender Management Agency has delivered spending reductions and achieved value for money. ""However, its spending is vulnerable to even slight changes in demand, over which it has no control, and it has very little flexibility to absorb unforeseen costs. ""There are therefore risks to the agency's ability to make sustainable savings over the long term, when the prison population is unlikely to fall significantly and the agency's funding will continue to reduce."" 'Good work' A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that officials were continuing to work out what savings needed to be made. ""We are pleased this report recognises the good work maintained by [the National Offender Management Agency] in a challenging financial environment. The organisation continued to reduce reoffending while meeting its savings targets for 2011/12. ""We will consider the NAO's recommendations and look at how best to take them forward."" But Margaret Hodge MP, chairwoman of the Commons public accounts committee, said: ""I am concerned that the agency has yet to pin down a plan to get back on track. ""The agency's fragile financial outlook is at the mercy of events, such as last August's riots and the sentencing decisions of judges and magistrates over which it has little control."" In a separate report, the chief inspectors of constabulary, probation, prisons and prosecutions said restorative justice programmes were being used inconsistently. The programmes, which can be used as alternatives to standard sentences for criminals, include allowing the offender to meet the victim to apologise. The report found that there were good examples of how restorative justice was being used and that informal resolutions were used by police in 12% of cases in 2011, but it said that the take up of programmes was less widespread in prisons and young offender institutions or probation trusts.","The prison service will struggle to meet targets on cuts because a key sentencing change has been ditched, the government's spending watchdog says."
"The seven-year-old was airlifted to hospital with head injuries after falling from the ride at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire in May 2019. York Magistrates' Court heard the ride no longer operated and the park viewed the accident with ""great sadness"". The boy fell from the Twister attraction during the spring half-term holiday, the court heard. Bosses at the theme park, near Ripon, admitted breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Judge Adrian Lower was told the boy had not been wearing a seat belt and fell through a gap between the seat and a restraining bar. But the boy and his mother, who was in the car with him, were not told they had to wear a seat belt, the court heard. Judge Lower was told the effectiveness of the restraining bar was not enough to hold the youngster in position. Prosecutor Craig Hassall said the victim suffered serious head injuries following the fall and was airlifted to hospital in Leeds. His mother saw him slip under the restraint as he was ejected from the car which was between two and three metres from the ground at the time Mr Hassall said seatbelt rules were not universally understood by ride operatives and that maintenance of seatbelts was not adequate or in effective working order.

"They insist consumers want to know if ceramics are made in the UK, or abroad. Matthew Rice, chief designer at Emma Bridgewater Pottery, said: ""People do like the idea of things made in England."" The campaign has support from Staffordshire MPs from all parties. ""Shopping is the most political thing we all do and choosing what we buy - based on where it was made, how it was made and what went into it - is an incredibly significant way of changing things,"" said Mr Rice. The Conservative MP for South Staffordshire, Gavin Williamson, is a former managing director of Aynsley China. He recently secured an adjournment debate in the House of Commons about country of origin markings for manufactured products. ""We cannot forget that Made in England and Made in Great Britain have value for consumers in this country, but probably more so around the globe,"" said Mr Williamson. He believes that a stamp which stated where products were made would help to boost British manufacturing and urged the government to legislate accordingly. Voluntary decision Stoke-on-Trent North MP Joan Walley was one of the politicians to show their support for Mr Williamson. She said: ""The real issue is that goods are being sold in a confused way, and consumers are buying products without realising that they are not manufactured, designed, decorated and so forth in the UK."" But Consumer Minister Ed Davey maintains that marking products with their country of origin should be a voluntary decision for each manufacturer - like it is at the moment. And not all pottery companies are in favour of country of manufacture backstamps. Norman Tempest, managing director of Royal Stafford Tableware in Burslem, said most shoppers were not really bothered about the origin of manufacture. ""I don't think it makes a great deal of difference to the consumer. When people are making a buying decision over pottery, it's usually the design, the shape that people go for - and then the price. ""And if it happens to be made in England, that's a bonus.""",MPs and pottery firms in Staffordshire have urged the government to introduce new laws forcing manufacturers to clearly label where their products are made.
"The preferred route of phase two goes north from Birmingham along two branches, with new stations at Toton near Nottingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Manchester and Manchester Airport. Prime Minister David Cameron said there were particular benefits to linking the UK's major cities with high-speed rail. Phase one's London-Birmingham link has faced considerable opposition. Critics argue that HS2's predicted economic benefits have been overestimated by the government, and suggest swathes of picturesque countryside will be blighted by the railway. Chancellor George Osborne's Tatton constituency in Cheshire is among the places phase two will pass through. But he said: ""If our predecessors hadn't decided to build the railways in the Victorian times, or the motorways in the middle part of the 20th Century, then we wouldn't have those things today. ""You have got to commit to these projects even though they take many years."" The Department for Transport said that HS2 phase two would virtually halve journey times between Birmingham and Manchester - to 41 minutes - and between London and Manchester from two hours and eight minutes to one hour and eight minutes. Speeds of up to 250mph on HS2 will also reduce a Birmingham to Leeds journey from two hours to 57 minutes, while phase one will cut London-Birmingham travel to 49 minutes, from the current one hour and 24 minutes. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ""It's not just about journey times, it is also about capacity. ""We are finding the railways are overcrowded. We've seen massive growth in rail passenger numbers, so this is taking HS2 so it serves the north."" Mr McLoughlin told MPs a period of informal consultation on the exact route would start immediately and inform an official public consultation later this year, with a firm decision reached in 2014. A proposed spur to Heathrow Airport has been put on hold pending a review of UK aviation policy, due to report in 2015. 'Fundamentally flawed' More than 70 groups oppose HS2. StopHS2 argues the project is ""fundamentally flawed"", saying the majority of journeys will be to London so England's North and Midlands will lose out rather than benefit, and that projections do not take into account competition from conventional rail. StopHS2 campaign manager Joe Rukin said: ""Fifty-five percent of the economic benefits are based on the cash value of time, no-one works on trains and every business user is worth Â£70,000 a year - it's basically a train for the rich that everyone else is not only going to have to pay for the construction of but also have to subsidise throughout its lifetime as well."" Other opponents object on the grounds that HS2 will cut through picturesque countryside, and 18 councils along the route have said taxpayers cannot afford the line, and that it will increase greenhouse gas emissions. The phase two announcement was welcomed by officials in northern English cities including Leeds, where city council leader Keith Wakefield said: ""It will strengthen Leeds' position as the northern transport hub, and unlock major investment, jobs opportunities and connectivity to the rest of the country."" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ""We can't keep turning a blind eye to the north-south divide in our economy. That is what this high-speed project is all about."" Construction on the Y-shaped extension could start in the middle of the next decade, with the line open by 2032-33. While new stations will be built at Manchester Airport, Manchester, Leeds, Sheffield and Toton, high-speed trains will also stop at Crewe's existing station on their way to Preston and Liverpool. They will also be able to continue to Runcorn, Wigan, Durham, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Construction of the London-West Midlands route is expected to begin around 2017, once Parliament has approved the necessary powers, probably in 2015. The Toton station along phase two of the route will primarily serve Derby and Nottingham, while the Sheffield station will be sited at the Meadowhall shopping centre five miles from the city centre. 'Timetable slipping' Labour's shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle said: ""I think it's tremendously important that we link our airports to our cities, not some station in the middle of nowhere near a city and bypass our main hub airports. ""So I think there are questions to be asked and we will be asking them, but overall this is a good thing for the country and we need to get on and give certainty."" She previously highlighted ""worrying signs that the Department for Transport's timetable to deliver this vital infrastructure is slipping"". Details have also been published of the consultation on HS2 Ltd's proposed exceptional hardship scheme for phase two, which will cover compensation to affected property-owners.",Details of the next phase of the Â£32bn HS2 high-speed rail network have been unveiled by the government.
"Carson Price, 13, of Hengoed, Caerphilly, was pronounced dead after being found unconscious in Ystrad Mynach Park on Friday. A form of MDMA, known as Donkey Kong pills, is also a line of inquiry and Gwent Police is trying to trace Carson's movements prior to his death. No arrests have been made. Supt Nick McLain said a community outreach team - made up of youth workers who discourage young people from committing anti-social behaviour - were in the park on Friday. However, it is not known whether they came across or spoke to Carson. ""The focus of our investigation is around illegal substances and the supply of those substances on the night in question,"" said Supt McLain. ""It has attracted a lot of attention on social media and that has spawned lots of intelligence and information about what has happened in this area on Friday night. ""I think where we're focused at the moment is Carson's movement prior to him coming to the park that evening ""It's really important for us to ascertain at the moment is where he went, where he could've come into possession of drugs, and who could've supplied those drugs to him."" Supt McLain said ""somebody out there will know where he got those drugs from"". He added: ""It's a small community and people are rightly concerned and they want to tell us what they know. ""If anyone wants to tell us anybody who's producing unlawful drugs - whether there's one dealer, two dealers or three dealers producing and selling it, we need to know.""",Police investigating the death of a 13-year-old boy have said drugs were involved and officers are focusing on finding out who supplied them.
"It pledged an extra 10,000 officers for England and Wales by reversing cuts to capital gains tax planned by ministers. But Plaid Cymru claimed if Labour was serious about supporting police it would back devolving the service. The Tories dismissed the plans as ""nonsensical"", saying Labour had already committed the tax savings to funding other pledges. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said ""Labour's sums don't add up"" and claimed its promises ""aren't worth the paper they are printed on"". Labour said the extra officers would be in addition to the 500 community support officers funded by the Labour-led Welsh Government. The party's Shadow Welsh Secretary, Christina Rees, said: ""Despite their promises to protect our communities, the Tories at Westminster have slashed Welsh police numbers. ""Their reckless approach has put Welsh communities at risk."" Diane Abbott, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme the party did not think it was ""right at this time"" to devolve policing. But asked why the party had abstained on the devolution of policing in a Westminster vote, she added: ""I think it's because it is something that we are currently discussing."" Ms Abbott said: ""You will see it when we unroll our manifesto in the next few weeks."" She said the policy was needed because of a ""worrying rise"" in knife and gun crime, but admitted that had been seen in London and other big cities, and ""not necessarily in Wales"". According to official statistics, the number of police officers in Wales has fallen from 7,370 in March 2010 to 6,625 by last September. Plaid Cymru's policing spokeswoman, Liz Saville Roberts, said figures by Dyfed Powys Police showed that if responsibility for Welsh policing was transferred to the Welsh Government, Welsh police forces would be Â£25m better off. ""If the Labour Party were serious about supporting our police forces and keeping Wales safe, they wouldn't have voted with the Tories to keep Welsh policing in Westminster's hands,"" Ms Roberts said. A UKIP spokesman accused Labour of having no plan to implement its policy of increasing police numbers, saying ""money doesn't grow on trees"". He said UKIP planned to reduce the overseas aid budget and put the money saved into services such as policing and social care. For the Liberal Democrats, Lord German said Labour had committed spending from reversing capital gains tax cuts so many times ""you have to wonder whether they have found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow"". ""What we need is concrete policy proposals that will put police officers back on our streets, not the fanciful sums that Labour are offering,"" he added.",Labour has promised to pay for an extra 853 police officers in Wales if it wins the general election in June.
"The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) said the increase put to members in higher education institutions was unacceptable. Union bosses have recommended lecturers vote against the deal. If lecturers agree to action up to or including a strike, it is likely to begin in October and possibly be linked to action by other unions. The University and College Union (UCU) is already balloting its members for industrial action over pay. General secretary of the EIS, Larry Flanagan, said university lecturers had endured pay awards of less than the rate of inflation for each of the past three years and were ""not prepared to accept a fourth year of real-terms pay decline"". He added: ""Scotland is proud of its higher education sector, and the fact that it sends such a large percentage of young people to universities and other higher education establishments. ""Our excellent lecturing staff are absolutely essential to this success, so it is right that they should be appropriately and fairly remunerated for the valuable teaching and research work that they do."" Lecturer pay is subject to UK-wide negotiations through the New Joint Negotiating Committee for Higher Education Staff (New JNCHES). Mr Flanagan said: ""I would urge all EIS members working in higher education establishments to use their vote in this ballot, and to vote yes for industrial action in defence of their pay and their standard of living."" The EIS ballot will run until 10 October and if members vote yes then industrial action would start from 23 October. Responding to news of the ballot, a Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish government has invested significant funding in our universities and colleges and we appreciate the hard work and dedication of staff in the education sector. ""As independent bodies pay is a matter for institutions, staff, and the appropriate unions and we hope a solution can be found which avoids any disruption to students learning.""",Scotland's biggest teaching union is to ballot for industrial action over a pay offer of 1%.
"The three-month window is part of the agreement between the UK and EU. It determines how the new Irish Sea border will operate after Brexit. There has been a mixed reaction among political parties, but business organisations have broadly hailed it as a positive step. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium said the agreement ""removed one source of friction"" - but that there were still challenges ahead. ""Since the signing of the Withdrawal Agreement, we have been clear that the Northern Ireland Protocol was better than no deal,"" Mr Connolly said. ""However, to protect Northern Ireland households from unaffordable price rises and availability issues there needs to be a long-term workable solution that removes the myriad sources of friction."" He pointed out that there were just 22 days before the UK left the EU and retailers remained unsure about exact ways to move food to Northern Ireland. Mr Connolly said the details of the agreement needed to be the baseline for further deliberations, and not the end result. People in Northern Ireland should be allowed to trade in a way that keeps costs down and ensured continued choice for families, he added. Tesco chairman John Allan called it an ""important step in the right direction"". He described the news as ""an important step in the right direction"" but had yet to be briefed on further detail. Mr Allan said that the supermarket chain - which owns 56 stores in Northern Ireland - had been preparing for the worst, a no-trade deal, but he was confident Tesco would have been able to continue to supply food to NI either way This agreement would make that deal much easier, he said, telling BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Anything is better than nothing."" Asked what would happen if the grace period was not extended beyond three months, he replied: ""I'm quite sure we and other supermarket chains will cope."" The so-called grace period will initially be for three months, with six months guaranteed for chilled meat products, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has said. Unionist parties in Northern Ireland, opposed to the Protocol as they argue the divide it creates between NI and the rest of the UK poses a risk to the union. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP's Westminster leader, said ""safeguarding the union is not a three-month project"" but rather ""an enduring commitment"". He asked Mr Gove to commit, if necessary, to introducing ongoing ""safeguard measures"" to maintain unfettered access from NI to GB and GB to NI. 'Unionism's biggest mistake since partition' While Ulster Unionist peer Lord Empey described detail of the plans as a ""bad day for Northern Ireland"". He said the Protocol was ""the biggest strategic mistake unionism has made since partition in 1921"". ""We now have a border in the Irish Sea, the border has been moved from Newry to Larne,"" he added. He criticised the DUP leader Arlene Foster and accused her party of reneging on its previously declared ""blood red line"" opposing any regulatory alignment with the EU. ""She stood on her head as did all of her colleagues so I think that is a shame and disgrace,"" he added. The DUP deputy leader Lord Dodds described Lord Empey's comments as ""petty nonsense"" which ""should be abandoned by other unionists"". ""We have opposed the Northern Ireland Protocol, we will continue to do that,"" he said. Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the Irish Sea border would be ""destructive"" both economically and constitutionally. ""This is a sad day because in truth Northern Ireland is being left behind within much of the EU, while Great Britain makes its full exit with partition now down the Irish Sea,"" he added. Sinn FÃ©in's Vice-President Michelle O'Neill, whose party opposed Brexit, gave the agreement a broad welcome but, again, is keen to see the detail. The grace period would ""create breathing space for retailers and traders"", she said. ""It is now incumbent on the British government to engage directly with businesses in order to make them aware of exactly what the new arrangements will be and what they will be required to do and, crucially, what support will available for them,"" she said. ""It is welcome that the EU will have a permanent presence in the north to monitor the implementation and outworking of the Withdrawal Agreement and Irish Protocol. SDLP assembly member (MLA) Matthew O'Toole said progress on implementing the Protocol was ""welcome"", but he stressed that the government had wasted months of time by letting the negotiations run to the last moment. He said it was ""deeply regrettable"" that some unionists felt their Britishness would be undermined by the Protocol. Those who had ""championed Brexit"" needed to look inwards and reflect that some of them had pushed for ""the hardest possible Brexit"", he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. Alliance deputy leader and North Down MP Stephen Farry said there was ""no escaping"" the reality that all forms of Brexit would lead to some form of friction between NI and the rest of the UK. ""This plan amounts to changing a solid line down the Irish Sea to a dotted line,"" he added. ""I do therefore acknowledge the progress that has been made.... but outcomes are coming very late to give people to prepare.""","Northern Ireland's business leaders have given a guarded welcome to news of a ""grace period"" to ensure food supplies from GB to NI do not face disruption from 1 January."
"A coroner concluded neglect contributed to Rachel Johnston's death and the 49-year-old would probably have survived if staff acted sooner. Senior coroner David Reid has sent a report to the owners of Pirton Grange, near Worcester. The home said systems have since been improved. Mr Reid's report to prevent future deaths has been sent to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) as well as lawyers for both the home and Miss Johnston's family, following the inquest's conclusion. He raised concerns about a lack of adequate internal investigations or disciplinary procedures to identify the failings of nurses and no policy was in place to suspend staff while investigations were carried out. Miss Johnston's teeth were surgically removed at Kidderminster Hospital on 26 October 2018 because of severe decay. However she fell ill after returning to the care home and, when an ambulance was called two days later, her ""entire brain had been starved of oxygen"", her inquest heard. Her family decided to withdraw life support and she died two weeks later. Mr Reid said ""gross failures"" by two care home nurses who did not record and properly monitor Miss Johnston's condition, contributed to her death. Care home manager Jane Colbourn, giving delayed evidence on Friday, said the two nurses carried on working at the home because they ""knew residents well"". They were only referred to the NMC by care home owner Holmleigh Homes on 23 February, the firm's quality assurance manager told the hearing. In his report, Mr Reid said prevention action needed to be taken and the firm had until 21 May to respond. Holmleigh Homes said changes have been made to improve systems and procedures and staff given additional training in all key areas highlighted by the case. In a statement after Friday's hearing, Miss Johnston's mother Diana said ""justice had been done"" through the coroner's investigation and she was relieved the nurses had now been reported.

"The recommendation would increase differences with England, where new qualifications are planned. The Welsh review also calls for more challenging GCSEs that test literacy and numeracy and the creation of a new body to set and regulate exams. The review follows concern the exam system is currently too complex. It heard concerns about the quality of GCSE students' abilities at reading, writing and maths. The report says some employers and universities do not think that a grade C at GCSE English, Welsh and maths is a reliable indicator of literacy and numeracy skills. It calls for new GCSEs in English language and first language Welsh that put more emphasis on the quality and accuracy of students' writing and on the core skills of spelling, punctuation and grammar. Its author, Huw Evans, former principal of Coleg Llandrillo, said he wanted to guarantee the ""rigour"" of qualifications and make sure they are recognised by employers and universities. Some degree of ""divergence"" with England was unavoidable, he said. GCSEs in core subjects at secondary schools in England are being replaced by a new English Baccalaureate which will be awarded on the basis of a single end-of-term exam. The first will be sat in 2017 with other subjects possibly added later. But Mr Evans said that ""where appropriate"" pupils in Wales should continue to do modular courses, picking up marks that count towards their final grades during the school year. The review, which makes 42 recommendations, proposes ""building on and strengthening the Welsh Baccalaureate"" to provide an ""overarching framework"" for 14 to 19-year-olds. The Welsh Bacc was introduced in 2002 to give teenagers a more rounded education. As well as core subjects such as maths and languages, students can also do work experience and voluntary placements. Under the review's recommendations, 16-year-olds will be able to gain a national level Welsh Bacc if they obtain at least five GCSEs at grades A to C and the components of the baccalaureate. An advanced Baccalaureate will continue to be available for A-level students. It is also recommended that a new body called Qualifications Wales should be established at arms length from the Welsh government to regulate qualifications. Although they would continue to set policy, ministers would lose responsibility for regulating the exams system. The new organisation would eventually award most of the qualifications sat by teenagers in Wales. Education Minister Leighton Andrews came under fire this summer when he ordered the WJEC board, which sets most of the GCSEs taken by Welsh pupils, to re-grade English exams. Mr Andrews said he acted after a report by his officials found the way grade boundaries were set was unfair. He has previously described GCSEs as a ""very strong brand"" and said the UK government's decision to replace them in England was a ""backwards step"". Deputy minister for skills Jeff Cuthbert said: ""The purpose of this review was to ensure that the qualifications available to learners in Wales are relevant, valued and understood, and that those qualifications are what employers and universities want. ""An important part of this is making sure that qualifications available in Wales are recognised and valued not only in Wales, but also across the border and worldwide.""","Teenagers in Wales should continue to sit GCSEs as part of a revamped Baccalaureate, an independent report says."
"It is the third time Arnold Pickering, 44, from Greater Manchester, has gone on the run. He was jailed for life in 1991 after killing a man in Oldham. He and another inmate, Thomas Moffett, 51, from Blackburn, convicted of a number of robberies, failed to return to HMP Kennet on Saturday afternoon. People are urged not to approach them. Pickering last absconded in December 2009 when he was let out on day release from HMP Kirkham to take part in a Prison Service project in which prisoners emptied bins for Manchester City Council. In that case he handed himself in four days later in Motherwell, Scotland. Pickering also previously escaped from Strangeways in Manchester before he went on to stab a man to death in Oldham in 1990. He was given a life sentence and ordered to serve a minimum of 18 years. Merseyside Police said they believed both men could be in the Southport area. Swastika tattoos The force said both men left the Category C prison in Maghull at about 09:00 BST on Saturday on day release and had been due back at 16:30 BST. It said the men's disappearance was reported to Merseyside Police at about 19:00 BST the same day and officers had since been ""carrying out extensive inquiries"" to find them. A police spokesman said the two men had been deemed suitable for temporary release on licence by the Home Office, but urged anyone who saw them to call officers.

"There are 50 new nationalist members at Westminster, joining six SNP MPs who were re-elected from the 2010 intake. The MPs took their oaths in the Scottish style, which involves holding the right hand in the air. Each was required to read the passage in English, but a number also performed it in Gaelic and Scots. The first MP to swear in at the second Commons session of oath taking was the Conservatives' Europe minister David Lidington. The first of the new SNP intake was Ian Blackford, representing Ross, Skye and Lochaber, followed by Angela Crawley, MP for Lanark and Hamilton East. Livingston MP Hannah Bardell had to retake her oath after the ""genuine mistake"" of omitting the word ""Queen"" while reading the passage of allegiance. The vast majority of the nationalist MPs read the non-religious version: ""I do solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law."" Among the new intake: The traditional Scottish swearing in, or ""oath in the Scot's form"", was a traditional feature in courts in Scotland, although it is rarely used nowadays. Non-Scottish MPs asked the female clerk if they needed to raise their hand during the oath. She informed them it was not necessary and only the Scottish MPs were opting for that gesture.

"Emily Eccles, 15, from Sheffield, was left with just one centimetre of skin keeping her jaw attached to the rest of her head after the accident in August. Consultant surgeon Ricardo Mohammed-Ali rebuilt her face using three titanium plates and more than 160 stitches. Emily is now calling for him to receive a knighthood. The teenager was out riding in Baslow, Derbyshire, with a friend and her family when the accident happened. The horse was spooked by an exhaust popping on a car and galloped along a country path, but after her feet came out of the stirrups, she fell to one side and her head hit a wooden post. Emily was taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital after finding herself on the floor, holding what remained of the bottom of her face in her own hands. Mr Mohammed-Ali rebuilt her face in a five-and-a-half hour long operation which was such a success that the teenager was back at school for the start of term, just a month after the accident. He said: ""It could have been worse, but it is one of the most significant injuries that I have seen in a child outside of areas of conflict. ""Emily's injury was significant in that the entire left side of her lower jaw from the front of the jaw to the joint was pulled away from the face and only retained by a small strip of skin. ""I am extremely pleased with her recovery so far."" Emily said she first tried not to look, but accidentally switched on her selfie camera as she was messaging a friend. ""It was like something you see in a film, it was really quite horrific,"" she said. ""At first I was thinking, I don't know what I'm going to do, I'm not going to look like me, I'm not going to have the same kind of life as I did before.""

"The plan will see University College London Hospital (UCLH) and The Christie offer proton beam therapy, which uses a particle beam to destroy cancer cells. Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the centres would be a ""vital"" addition to the UK's cancer facilities. Earlier plans to also include University Hospitals Birmingham in the project were dropped in December. Currently, NHS patients in the UK needing the therapy have to travel to Switzerland or America for treatment. Dr Ed Smith, of the Christie, said the treatment was particularly effective because it targeted the cancer precisely. ""With X-rays, when you are treating a patient, they can go through the tumour and affect the normal tissues,"" he said. ""With proton beam therapy, you can stop the beam in the tumour itself, so you're sparing much more of the normal tissue."" 'Significant difference' Experts said the therapy had been found to be particularly suitable for use against complex childhood cancers and adult brain, neck and head cancers. UCLH's chief executive Sir Robert Naylor said the new facilities would make a ""significant difference to the lives of hundreds of patients every year, particularly children and teenagers"". ""It provides an opportunity for the NHS to become a world leader in paediatric radiotherapy, and gain an international profile in many complex adult cancers,"" he said. Mr Lansley said that about 1,500 patients a year could benefit from the new facilities, which he said would be ""unparalleled"". ""Developing a national proton beam therapy service is vital to ensuring our cancer facilities are world class,"" he said. The Department of Health (DfH) announced in October 2010 that three hospitals were to be considered as host hospitals for the new centres. The government said University Hospitals Birmingham had now been identified as a third potential site - but only if demand increased. A spokesman for the DfH said UK-based proton beam therapy facilities would reduce the cost of sending patients abroad, which was expected to cost Â£30m a year by 2014.","A Â£250m project to build ""cutting-edge"" radiotherapy centres in Manchester and London by 2017 has been confirmed."
"Dr Rajeshkumar Mehta, 64, was employed as a locum at The Hill General Practice and Care Centre in Sparkhill.

He was found guilty at Birmingham Crown Court and jailed for 15 months. The CPS said, after the appointment at the GP surgery inside Sparkhill Primary Care Centre on Stratford Road, the victim told the practice what had happened and Dr Mehta was reported to the police.

"The group took part in a formal ceremony at Syracuse University to remember the 35 students it lost. Colin Dorrance, part of the team, said the journey had been ""tough a lot of the time"" but ""absolutely worth it"". He said they had wanted to show the community in the United States they were thinking of them. The Cycle to Syracuse began in September ahead of the 30th anniversary of the bombing on 21 December. It claimed 270 lives and the cyclists said they were making the trip for those who did not make it home. In a ceremony on Friday, roses were laid in memory of the 35 Syracuse students who died, and the eleven people killed on the ground in Lockerbie. They carried out the journey in three stages starting with a tour of schools in the Lockerbie area. There was then a mass participation cycle from Lockerbie to Edinburgh Castle last month. The final leg in the United States was from Washington DC to Syracuse University. As part of the challenge the team was also raising funds for a local mental health charity to fund a dedicated worker based in Lockerbie Academy. Mr Dorrance - a former policeman who attended the scene of the Lockerbie bombing - said things had gone to plan and he felt ""content"". ""We met many families and they appreciated the gesture that we have made and that was exactly the intention - we wanted to show our support and unity,"" he said. However, he said travel conditions had not always been kind on their American leg. ""The weather was against us, it was cold - all week it has been cold,"" he said. ""The traffic has been heavy, many more traffic lights than we had anticipated. ""Many were on the uphill and many were red, we've had all sorts of challenges."" Despite that he said it had been worth the effort. 'Good things' ""I wouldn't have changed any of that for the world,"" he said. ""We have met relatives each day either before, during or after the ride - they've all been hospitable, they've all told us stories of what they've done with their lives in the 30 years since. ""We have heard all sorts of stories of good things they have done in the years afterwards. ""We wanted to show the community here that we are thinking of them, not just remotely from across the Atlantic but we were prepared to come here literally under our own steam to do that - that's how important it is to us.""",A team of cyclists has completed the final leg of its ride from Lockerbie to New York in tribute to those killed in the 1988 bombing.
"Economy Minister Diane Dodds announced arrangements for how the qualifications would be awarded on Friday, after the exams were cancelled in January. The Department for the Economy oversees BTecs and essential skills exams. Mrs Dodds said some assessments may need to be delayed until they can be carried out safely. The results will be issued on 10 and 12 August this year, in line with the GCSE, AS and A-level results dates. BTecs are vocational and technical qualifications equivalent to GCSEs and A-levels and are taken by many students in schools and colleges. Mrs Dodds said teacher judgement would be based on ""suitable evidence"", including tasks or assessments that have already been completed. A range of adaptations will be put in place to facilitate qualifications that require a demonstration of occupational or professional competence, such as plumbing, construction, accountancy or electrical installation, she said. ""Assessments to demonstrate practical skills will still need to go ahead this year and a range of adaptations will be put in place to facilitate these, where possible, such as remote assessment,"" added Mrs Dodds. ""Awarding organisations are working closely with schools, colleges and training providers to set out the detailed requirements for different qualifications to enable award of results this year."" She urged anyone affected to speak directly to their school, college or training provider about their options. ""The pandemic has presented huge challenges to the delivery of education and all parts of the education system are collaborating to ensure that learners are still able to get their results and progress to the next stage, whether that is further study, training or the workplace,"" she said.","Teacher judgement is to play a ""central role"" in determining the results of BTec and essential skills qualifications due to the pandemic."
"By Andy GiddingsBBC News Online Charlie Adlard spent 15 years illustrating the black-and-white monthly, which sold millions of copies and spawned a hit TV show. Despite being inundated with offers of work - including a ""zombie-related"" project from industry giant Marvel - he plans to turn his back on the undead. ""I want to do other stuff, I want to prove my versatility,"" he said. ""People just think because you've drawn zombies for 15 years, you want to carry on drawing zombies."" Fans were left stunned when the cult series, which followed the survivors of a zombie outbreak, reached its unannounced conclusion last month. Adlard said it had been ""four years in the planning"" after he and writer Robert Kirkman decided they ""really needed an end point"". ""A lot of people think that we just thought about this a couple of months before, but no, this was something that was planned for a very, very long time,"" the Shrewsbury-based artist said. Adlard said it was ""brilliant"" to no longer have a monthly deadline looming over him and he was highly unlikely to return to the format. ""I know 'never say never again', but I don't think I'll ever do a regular series again. ""I'd rather now, for the rest of my career, work on smaller projects."" Offers of work have since flooded in. Marvel and DC have made approaches, but Adlard said drawing established superheroes wasn't his thing. He turned Marvel down. ""It was, shall we say, zombie-related and the one thing I don't want to do, for obvious reasons, is anything zombie-related,"" he said. While he is considering DC's offer to produce covers, Adlard admits: ""Once you've worked on your own characters it seems like a retrograde step to be working on somebody else's characters."" The Walking Dead Now free of the Walking Dead, the financial security from his work on Rick Grimes and Co has allowed Adlard to pick and choose future projects, something he finds ""creatively very, very exciting"". And the French comics industry - ""the most vibrant"" in the world, in Adlard's view - appeals to him the most. ""I love their approach, I love what they do. They call comics the ninth art over in France, so it's actually appreciated over there."" He says artists get more respect in France, where they receive a greater billing than writers. ""In the US and the UK at the moment and in the last 10 or 15 years, the writer has been the dominant force in comic books,"" he said. But that is unfair, because ""it just implies that the writer is the main creative force in the comic book, which is totally untrue, because it should be both"", he adds. Adlard's Gallic invasion has started with a contribution to a book marking the 60th anniversary of his ""favourite all-time character"", legendary French hero Asterix. He credits RenÃ© Goscinny and Albert Uderzo - who created the Gaulish warrior and beefy sidekick Obelix - with fuelling his love for French comic books. His next creation, also written in French, is ""fun horror/thriller"" Vampire State Building, with digitally inked art marking a departure from the Walking Dead's traditional pen and ink style. ""More short-sighted people would probably see it as me not being particularly imaginative and going from a bunch of zombies to a bunch of vampires."" But he said the contemporary setting and emphasis on action over horror appealed. Vampire State Building is planned as a two-book story, with the second part due out in France in the autumn. Adlard has also been taken ""out of his comfort zone"" on his upcoming collaboration with Shrewsbury-based 2000AD writer Robbie Morrison. Provisionally titled Heretic, it will feature Cornelius Agrippa, a real-life character from the Spanish Inquisition era in a fictional, supernatural setting. Adlard said the story, a ""sort of thriller in the vein of something like In the Name of the Rose"", centred around the German mystic and his protÃ©gÃ©. ""It's something I've never done before. ""It excites me because I've never done historical drama."" Adlard is also considering working on a biographical story and mulling a number of other offers. While he won't be changing his art style, he plans to experiment more with his materials. He said Heretic would probably be drawn digitally, like Vampire State, but would make more use of pencil-tools ""to try and roughen it up, make it more textural"". But he may return to pen and paper, relying less on his ruler to make his ""lines sort of shaky"". And although he confessed a love for drawing characters such as Negan, he vowed that the Walking Dead comics, unlike their namesake, would not come back to life. ""We don't want to short-change the fans"" he said. ""It just feels really disingenuous to do something like that. ""We said it's the end. It is the end.""",The artist behind The Walking Dead comics says he is done with zombies after the series came to a sudden end.
"Det Con Jeffrey Davies, 42, was convicted at Swansea Crown Court on Thursday of two sexual assaults and cleared of one offence of exposure.

"By Angie BrownBBC Scotland News It comes after Nicola Sturgeon announced plans to begin relaxing lockdown rules and lift the five-mile travel limit from next Friday. Booking website TravelNest said the lockdown had been a very tough period for holiday let owners. But it said it had seen a huge surge in demand for properties since the government announcement. The first minister said on Wednesday that the use of self-contained holiday accommodation such as cottages and lodges with no shared services will be allowed from 3 July. From 15 July, all holiday accommodation will be able to reopen, as will museums, galleries, cinemas, and monuments. Cameron Boal, marketing vice-president of Edinburgh-based TravelNest, said tourists began to make bookings the day before Ms Sturgeon's announcement following speculation the regulations would be lifted in July. ""In the last 48 hours we've had over 700 nights booked across our 2,500 properties. It's gone absolutely crazy,"" he added. ""That is more than a 100% increase on our best days from earlier in the year when people typically book their summer holiday. ""It's been a very tough period so it's fantastic that it's now opening up. ""Owners have been crying out for this and we are already seeing the market bouncing back with such velocity."" Annette Devenish, who owns Westcote Glamping on an 80 acre sheep farm between Hawick and Denholm in the Scottish Borders said the first three weekends of reopening had already been booked for her five caravans, pods and huts. She said: ""It is absolutely great. We have had lots of bookings and even a late night enquiry at 11pm after the government announcement. ""Last year we were fully booked so hopefully it will be the same for the rest of this summer too."" She said she had bought another toilet for the gypsy caravans because shared facilities are not allowed under the new regulations. Gordon Murray, who owns Craigmaddie Muir Roundhouse in Clyde Valley with his wife Susie, said the accommodation on their 450 acre sheep farm near Milngavie had been fully booked until October since it was built in time for 14 February this year. He said: ""It's a wooden bespoke romantic roundhouse with 180 degree views of the Clyde Valley. We were amazed by the uptake and were fully booked so it was very hard when the lockdown hit and we had to cancel bookings. ""In the last fortnight we have seen a real spike in bookings since the government announced the tourism sector was to open up on 15 July. ""We are more or less full in August and September now and only have two free weekends left between now and November. ""It has been very stressful so I'm very relieved now that the uptake has been so positive."" Richard Close, who owns Langbank Luxury Lodges in Renfrewshire with his wife, said he has seen an increase in followers on Facebook since an announcement about tourism two weeks ago. ""Normally it would be great if we had five bookings in a week but yesterday we had five in a day plus lots of inquiries. It's been unprecedented,"" he added. ""We now have our lodges booked by 75% between July and October. ""I felt very anxious during the lockdown especially as we didn't know when we would be allowed to reopen. We had wifi contracts and to keep the place maintained but no income, it has been very hard. ""There was a lack of support for new business so we were just left.

"Marvin Rees has been told to complete his plans to reduce pollution, particularly from diesel engines. He said he was looking at options but previously explained delays were caused over by concerns raised over proposals to introduce congestion charges.

'Absolutely astonished' Ministers said they wanted Bristol's plans handed in by the end of last year.

"By Gavin StampPolitical reporter, BBC News The Conservatives' theme at their virtual party conference this week is a message that Boris Johnson has sought to impart continuously since the country emerged from lockdown in early July. But as the prime minister prepares to deliver his leader's speech on Tuesday, his party is facing up to the impact that the worst public health crisis for a century is likely to have on its ability to deliver on its promises to voters. The PM has insisted his mission of national renewal, the ""levelling-up"" agenda which was a key backdrop to the Tories' thumping victory in December's election, has not been put to one side in the national struggle against Covid. He says the programme, which the party describes on its conference website as ""driving lasting change in parts of the country forgotten by successive governments"", is being accelerated, rather than slowed, by the pandemic. 'Blue wall' And the rush of announcements made during the four-day event and beforehand suggest the government knows it cannot afford to lose sight of its over-riding objective, that is to give those living outside London and the south of England a better chance in life and bigger slice of the economic cake. In his own speech, the PM will earmark Â£160m to upgrade ports and infrastructure in Teesside, the Humber and other areas as part of a drive to make the UK a world-leader in low-cost green energy. Elsewhere, the lion's share of a Â£80m fund for local regeneration projects is going to towns in the North East, North West and Yorkshire, a review of transport links will look at upgrading the A1 in Northumberland, while a shake-up of vocational education will pay for all 18-year-olds without an A-level to take a college course. These are all consistent with the Tories' promises in their election manifesto to share prosperity and opportunities more equally across the UK and to boost economic performance beyond the capital. The party is also seeking to leave a more permanent imprint of its own by opening a second HQ in Leeds while creating a fighting fund to help its MPs defend the dozens of ""Red Wall"" seats snatched from Labour in December, some of which turned blue for the first time in electoral history. But as Conservative activists grapple with the role that transport, green and digital technologies will play in the UK's post-Covid recovery, the legacy of what is the UK's deepest post-war recession cannot be ignored. 'Daunting task' The Institute for Fiscal Studies says the government faces a ""daunting task"" if it is to reverse deep-seated regional inequalities, among the most pronounced in Europe, in the current climate. In a recent analysis, the respected think tank warned that inequalities within regions are often more acute, with towns in post-industrial regions, coastal resorts and isolated rural areas among those which have fallen furthest behind, a situation which could be exacerbated by Covid and any disruption to post-Brexit trade with Europe. Even ""well-designed policies could take years or even decades to have a meaningful effect"", it says. While the government is right to focus on addressing decades of under-investment in transport and R&D outside London and the South East, it says the cost of closing the gap cannot be underestimated, with Â£22bn alone being needed to bring per person spending on transport across England in line with that in the capital. The government, it adds, ""cannot be all things to all places"". Whatever improvements can be made in infrastructure, housing and skills, the IFS says the success of the levelling-up agenda will inevitably be judged on how far employment and pay disparities can be closed. 'By a thread' Middlesbrough, identified by the think tank as one of the five most ""left-behind"" towns in terms of working-age employment rates, has had some recent success stories to celebrate. Start-up bank GBB announced recently it would set up its headquarters in the town, creating more than 120 jobs, while the National Hydrogen Transport Centre is also basing itself there - consolidating the Teesside's market-leading position in the emerging clean technology. But, at the same time, Covid is casting a long shadow over the North East, with the Mayor of Middlesbrough warning that thousands of jobs in hospitality and retail are ""hanging by a thread"" due to local restrictions. Speaking to the BBC's Newscast podcast last week, Andy Preston - who despite being an independent is admired by local Tories - said the implications of the virtual lockdown for the local economy were ""monstrous"". He said he had been left ""fuming"" at what he said was the lack of consultation and dialogue with ministers over restrictions, which have prompted claims of a growing North-South divide in the second wave of the disease. Local relations The fraying in relations between local leaders and ministers does not augur well at a time when the government's blueprint for further devolution in England has reportedly been shelved until next year. Far-reaching plans to create more combined authorities and directly elected mayors, while at the same time abolishing a raft of district councils, have caused unease in some Tory heartlands. Former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, who championed English devolution while advising David Cameron, has urged the government to get on with it, saying a lack of local delivery mechanisms is hampering progress. ""There should be no presumption that civil servants in London devising schemes which seem sensible to ministers should be imposed on local economies,"" he told a recent meeting of the Lords Economic Affairs Committee. But the former Tory, who lost the party whip after rebelling against the government over Brexit, has urged ministers to get the capital on board and not give the impression that London is being penalised for its success. ""It is very difficult to see how you level up without levelling down somebody,"" he said. ""You are never going to make a success of an economy by holding back the most successful core part.""","The UK can and will ""build back better""."
"By Steven McKenzieBBC Scotland Highlands and Islands reporter Whale and Dolphin Conservation field officer Charlie Phillips has asked that sailors and crews of boats using the city's harbour and marina and the Kessock Channel not seek out the juvenile. He said loud noises from boats could scare dolphins and lead to the juvenile being separated from its mother. Mr Phillips spent five minutes earlier this week photographing the pair so he could identify the adult dolphin. The information he gathered on the short boat trip will be shared with Aberdeen University's Lighthouse Field Station at Cromarty. The adult is a female known as Kesslet. Kesslet has a seven-year-old son, dubbed Charlie, who has been seen hunting in the Kessock Channel and in the Moray Firth. The Moray Firth and North Sea provide habitat for the world's most northerly resident population of bottlenose dolphins. Research published in 2012 suggested the population was ""stable"" with almost 200 animals. The species is protected by European Union rules. Adults and juveniles can often been seen from the shores of the Moray Firth. In June, a Highlands-based photographer captured images of a young dolphin playing with a jellyfish in the firth. Mr Phillips said: ""I was tweeting this morning to all and sundry to please, please take care if you are using a boat, large or small around the harbour, marina and Kessock Channel area and don't try to chase them or try to get a closer look as tiny babies can be scared easily by loud noises. ""They can be accidentally separated from mum - which would be fatal at this stage.""",A baby bottlenose dolphin has been born in the sea near Inverness.
"George Fawkes has received about 20 kangaroos, wallabies and koalas since losing his cuddly ""Kangaroo"". The 10-year-old's mother Gilda contacted the BBC last month to help find the toy, which had accompanied George through years of surgery. Mrs Fawkes, of King's Lynn, said the response had been ""unbelievable"". George, who has Floating-Harbor Syndrome, requires regular surgery and always took Kangaroo with him. He lost his cuddly friend on a train as he travelled from Norfolk to Bristol Children's Hospital on 16 November. 'Lovely notes' Mrs Fawkes said she was contacted by the hospital, whose reception was ""full of parcels"" for him, including a toy platypus from Taronga Zoo in Sydney. ""They had all been anonymously sent with lovely notes attached,"" she said. ""It's unbelievable."" The original Kangaroo is still missing but George has since picked out a toy ""very similar to his friend"". ""We explained he was a cousin from Australia,"" Mrs Fawkes said. ""George still asks where Kangaroo is, but we have told him he found someone who needed a friend and now he seems a bit happier."" George, who did not want to have any more operations without Kangaroo, has now got his surgery schedule back on track. He even made a festive visit to the children's hospital to donate gifts to patients on Penguin Ward, where he has often stayed. Mrs Fawkes said a special thanks needed to go to ""Chris from the GWR lost property team and Martin, the children' disability officer at the hospital, who tweeted the 'Where are you, Kangaroo?' appeal"". She also said she had been contacted by two families who saw the original BBC article and have the same rare condition as George.",A boy with a rare form of dwarfism has been sent a number of soft animal toys by wellwishers after losing one he always took on regular hospital visits.
"He had a cardiac arrest on Sunday and ""received immediate attention in the medical centre"" according to race organisers Run 4 Wales. Mr Beckley died at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. The organisers said he had run the race twice before and was a regular runner and football player. Originally from north Devon, Mr Beckley lived in Cardiff. He worked in Cardiff council's planning department and had recently been appointed as senior planner. The council leader said he was a ""rising star"". Mr Beckley's brother, Andrew, described him as ""a true gentleman who will be sorely missed and always loved by all"". His brother said Mr Beckley was ""a family man"" who ""loved sport"", adding that he had moved to Cardiff for university in 2003. ""Although extremely proud to be from Devon and a country boy at heart, Nick was hugely passionate about Cardiff and saw it as his home,"" said Mr Beckley's brother. He added that Mr Beckley was ""a big fan"" of the half marathon, and was ""so pleased to see how it has grown over the last few years"". Mr Beckley also enjoyed travelling with his girlfriend Natalie and the pair ""visited many countries together over the past few years"", said his brother. Mr Beckley played for Cardiff Cosmopolitan Football Club, which is part of the South Wales Alliance League. Its first team manager, James Lovegrove, said Mr Beckley was a ""lovely lad"". ""He really looked after himself. He was super fit and now he's lost his life in a cruel way,"" he said. ""He was a road runner. He was the sort of guy who would play football on a Saturday and then run a marathon the following day. ""There was nothing about him that made you think there would be any danger in him running the marathon - he was that fit. ""He was doing something he loved."" Mr Lovegrove said Mr Beckley helped the club win two Cardiff and district premiership titles, and added he was ""the best midfield player the club has ever had"". He said the club ""can never replace"" Mr Beckley, who ""lived for the challenge"". 'He will be sorely missed' Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas said he was ""desperately sorry"" to hear the news of Mr Beckley's death, ""He was one of our own; a valued friend to his colleagues, and a rising star in the council's planning department,"" he added. ""He will be sorely missed in County Hall, and I know we all send our deepest condolences to his family and friends."" Matt Newman, chief executive at Run 4 Wales said: ""It's terribly sad news... not just our thoughts but our support is with the family at this really difficult time. ""It was an incident at the finish line, yards away from the primary medical centre so it was an instant response,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. Mr Newman added that Run 4 Wales had worked to raise awareness of unknown heart conditions following the deaths of two men at last year's event. ""We've done an incredible amount of work in terms of raising the profile... flagging that anyone that had any symptoms or history in their family or felt unwell in the run up to it that they would go to the doctor, they would get checked out and no-one would come to the start line with any risk to their health. ""We can only reiterate that really, it's cast obviously a big shadow on what was otherwise a very good day for Cardiff. ""We've had 16 years and until last year we hadn't had incidents of this kind. They have happened before in big events, unfortunately it is something that does happen when you get this volume of people running."" Mr Newman encouraged anyone intending to embark on an event like the half marathon to have a health check first. 'An impossible day' In 2018 Ben McDonald, 25, from Cardiff, and Dean Fletcher, 32, from Exeter, went into cardiac arrest and died after crossing the finishing line at the half marathon within three minutes of each other. No inquests took place, and a coroner's investigation found the pair died of natural causes. About 50 of Mr McDonald's friends and family walked the course in his memory this year, wearing yellow t-shirts. ""I think for them, an impossible day but they wanted to walk in his footsteps and follow the course,"" Mr Newman said. A record 27,500 runners signed up to take part in the 2019 event.",A runner who died after collapsing at the finish line of the Cardiff Half Marathon has been named as 35-year-old Nicholas Beckley.
"Jeremy Browne will also say that the genital mutilation of girls as young as five is ""barbaric"" and should be regarded as ""child abuse"". About 20,000 girls a year are thought to be at risk from the practice. The Lib Dem MP will also call for equal treatment of boys and girls in society. Honour crimes involve violence committed by people who want to defend the reputation of their family or community. Speaking at an event in the House of Lords, Mr Brown will argue that the UK's ""emancipation revolution"" should apply universally. 'Repulsion' But he will say thousands are losing out as a result of a ""deliberate rejection of the emancipation revolution and the equal opportunities now afforded to women and girls"". Mr Browne will add: ""It is unacceptable for the individual women and girls whose freedom and opportunities are stifled. And it is wrong for our society. There cannot be a pick-and-mix approach to living in a benign liberal country. The benefits must be universal, without exceptions or exemptions. ""I do not believe that cultural relativism provides an excuse to opt-out of our shared liberal social settlement. Everyone should enjoy the freedom to make their own choices, without the fear of social coercion."" The minister will urge society to show its ""collective repulsion about so-called 'honour crimes'"", including murder, rape and kidnap. According to a study based on census data, about 20,000 girls are at risk of genital mutilation, with one north London hospital recording 450 cases in the past three years. Yet there has not been a single prosecution, Mr Browne will say. He will say: ""I can only conclude that there is nervousness amongst some professionals to confront the practice of female genital mutilation head on. That it is viewed as an exotic or unusual custom practiced by a culture they should not intrude upon. ""That there is a cultural relativism that leads them to excuse what is being done to other people's daughters when they would never allow it to be done to their own. ""That those professionals are somehow not seeing female genital mutilation for what it really is. Because what it is, categorically and unequivocally, is child abuse. It can never be excused or ignored and it should be treated in the same way as any other form of child abuse."" Mr Browne will implore victims to report their treatment to ensure ""prosecution of this heinous crime"".","A Home Office minister is to warn people who set up forced marriages and commit so-called ""honour crimes"" that there ""cannot be a pick-and-mix approach"" to living in the UK."
"The Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) said last year's wet autumn followed by the icy spring and a hot summer were perfect for apple growing. Shoppers can expect to see the homegrown harvest appear in shops in the next few weeks, the RHS added. Last year's apple orchards experienced a poor harvest after a cool and wet spring and summer. Jim Arbury, fruit specialist at the RHS's Wisley garden in Surrey, said: ""Apples evolved in central Asia to suit a continental climate of hot summers and very cold winters and need to be exposed to a certain amount of cold weather each winter or they won't flower or fruit properly."" He explained that the wet autumn in 2012 helped to rule out the chance of drought which can lead to small, poor-tasting fruit. Chilly conditions right up until April gave the trees enough ""chill time"" for the fruit to set properly and held back flowering, he said. By the time they did flower, there were more insects around to pollinate the blossom and less risk of damage by frost. Then very hot weather in summer boosted ripening, he added. ""In the spring crops were lagging up to a month behind but a sudden burst of sunshine in prime ripening season late June and July has helped the apples gain some ground as well as helping them ripen up beautifully,"" said Mr Arbury.","This year's weather has created the ideal conditions for a bumper crop of sweet and rosy apples, experts say."
"By Stephen WalkerBBC News NI Political Correspondent Sir Vincent Fean was speaking to Westminster's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee investigating compensation for Libyan-sponsored IRA violence. Libyan Semtex was a key weapon in the IRA's Troubles bombing campaign. While Libya compensated US victims of terrorism, UK victims were left out of the deal. Sir Vincent, who has since retired, told MPs it would have been beneficial if American victims and Troubles victims had joined forces in their compensation claim. He said he found the US decision ""sad and negative"" and said he was not party to the decision taken in Washington DC. ""The United States had a large amount of influence at the time and indeed now, and joining with them would have increased the chances of success,"" he said. ""But the United States for reasons I do not fully understand did not wish to associate the UK victims with the US victims."" The Northern Ireland Affairs Committee also heard evidence from former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, who was a member of the Foreign Affairs committee. A year before he retired in 2010, Mr McKinlay visited Libya with DUP MPs Nigel Dodds and Jeffrey Donaldson. Mr MacKinlay said the case for the Libyan authorities to compensate Troubles victims was ""compelling and overwhelming"". He said the Conservative government in London should make the issue of compensation a top priority and that ""there should be a minister on a plane today"" to Libyan capital Tripoli. He said the issue raised a series of important questions, and was critical of former prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. He recalled that during a short meeting between victims and Mr Brown, the prime minister's body language and responses ""indicated a lack of real interest"". Mr MacKinlay also raised the case of Moussa Kousa, who was expelled from the UK in 1980 and went on to become Libyan foreign minister. He asked why the UK authorities did not question Mr Kousa when he was in the UK for three days in March 2011. Mr MacKinlay said if he had ""been questioned or put before the courts, we could have discovered more about the cosy relationships, discussions and agreements that have thwarted the possibility of obtaining compensation from the regime for victims"". Former Prime Minister Tony Blair has been asked by the committee to give evidence at a future date. During Northern Ireland questions in the Commons on Wednesday, independent MP Lady Hermon asked the government what pressure is being put on Libyan authorities to provide compensation. Northern Ireland Office minister Ben Wallace said the prime minister is ""very keen to try and seek some further compensation"". ""Of course it is hard at the moment to try and negotiate with a Libyan government that is not functioning or in existence,"" he said.","A former UK ambassador to Libya has said a decision in 2008 to exclude Troubles victims from a US compensation deal was ""deeply regrettable""."
"By Marie Louise ConnollyBBC Northern Ireland health correspondent A High Court judge in London ruled that aspects of the consultation process were ill-judged. These included a failure to make relevant information available. The ruling is the second intervention from the judge. Earlier, he also ruled that the process to close the children's heart unit at Leeds General Infirmary was legally flawed. However, as only one part of the decision is quashed it leaves the door open for further consultation over the Leeds closure. However, Sarah Quinlan from the Children's Heartbeat Trust in Northern Ireland said it was a positive move. ""Today's High Court ruling, which overturns the NHS decision to close paediatric heart surgery at Leeds Royal Infirmary, is a victory for families and clinicians who have prioritised the safety of children since this process began,"" she said. ""It is the same team who oversaw this discredited decision to close surgery at Leeds who visited Belfast last year and made similar recommendations for Northern Ireland."" The future of the service in Belfast is in jeopardy after a national review concluded that while the service is safe, it is not sustainable. One hundred operations are performed each year in Northern Ireland, with a further 40 cases dealt with elsewhere. While parents of sick children would prefer the unit, based at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children to remain as it is, travelling to Dublin as opposed to England is seen as an acceptable alternative and one of eight options currently on the table. 'Consternation' Last week, Health Minister Edwin Poots told the Stormont health committee that if he had agreed with recommendations suggested by officials it would have caused consternation. He added that people should feel heartened that a final decision is still to be reached. Reacting to Wednesday's move, Sarah Quinlan told the BBC that the process has been flawed from the start. ""The Royal College of Surgeons stated only last July that surgery here is safe and it is worth remembering that no medical professional body has endorsed the safe and sustainable guidelines for Northern Ireland which health officials sought to impose,"" she said. ""This entire episode begs the question as to why the Safe & Sustainable team were invited here in the first place. ""The Royal College of Surgeons review found no issues with the surgical provision, yet a team whose decision has now been overturned by the High Court were invited here based on guidelines which no medical professional body has endorsed for the region. """,Campaigners who want children's heart surgery services to remain in Belfast have said they are delighted by a court ruling overturning an NHS decision to close a similar service in Leeds.
"The Royal Deeside venue is home to the famous event which is attended by members of the Royal family. Exhibits at the new pavilion - supported by The Prince's Foundation - include medals and trophies. The Duke of Rothesay is the title by which Prince Charles is known while in Scotland. It is hoped the new building at the Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park will boost tourism. The Braemar Gathering - which will again be held this Saturday - is seen as the biggest in the Highland Games calendar, and attracts thousands of people. Queen Victoria first went to the Braemar Gathering in 1848 and since then the reigning monarch has regularly attended. The annual Highland Games event is held a short distance from the Royals' retreat on the Balmoral estate and is always held on the first Saturday in September. The Queen first attended the event as a seven-year-old child in 1933. 'Immerse themselves' Robert Lovie of The Prince's Foundation said: ""The Duke of Rothesay Highland Games Pavilion will offer visitors to Braemar from around the world the opportunity throughout the year to immerse themselves in Highland Games history. ""The collection of artefacts and items is really impressive and is sure to prove a big draw for those with an interest in Highland Games as well as act as an informative resource for those who are not as familiar with traditional highland sports."" The Prince's Foundation was formed as a result of the merger of four of HRH's existing charities. The new pavilion will also provide a new headquarters for the Braemar Royal Highland Society. David Geddes, president of the society, said ""For the last seven years, we have worked towards developing The Duke of Rothesay Highland Games Pavilion. ""HRH The Prince of Wales became interested in the project and had a vision of how he wanted the building to look and, through Michael Harris (architectural designer), we have a fantastic new design that I love. ""The Duke of Rothesay Highland Games Pavilion includes a new office for the society to call home. ""I think it's great for the future of the Highland Games. We have 200 years of history on paper and in photographs, and an archive accessible by the public will house all that. The new pavilion will allow us to tell the world the story of the Braemar Highland Gathering and the wider Highland Games circuit."" He added: ""I feel The Duke of Rothesay Highland Games Pavilion will be a major boost to tourism in Deeside. ""It is the type of attraction that is sadly lacking around here and will hopefully attract more people, including coach trips touring the area.""",A new Highland Games discovery centre on the site of the annual Braemar Gathering will be named The Duke of Rothesay Highland Games Pavilion.
"Ministers are accused of discriminating against those from EU member states who have been living and working in the UK. It is alleged an extra residency test applied by the UK to see if migrants are eligible to claim breaches EU law. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he planned to fight the commission ""every step of the way"". The EU has a standard test that is supposed to be applied by countries to determine a migrant's eligibility for welfare payments. But the British right-to-reside test goes further and restricts access to a number of social security benefits that would otherwise be available to those coming to the UK from another EU member state. 'Water down' The commission believes the UK is breaking EU law and alleges thousands of people may have been unfairly denied benefits as a result. Consequently, it plans to take Britain to the European Court of Justice - an action that could take years to complete. But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith accused the commission of trying to ""water down"" measures to protect British taxpayers. ""I will fight this every step of the way,"" he said. ""I will not cave in and I will continue to work on strengthening our benefit system in the meantime to ensure it is not open to abuse by anyone."" Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he believed the commission had got it ""wrong on this one"". He told the BBC: ""Of course we need to provide support to people who deserve it, who need it and who are entitled to it, but our benefits system is not a free-for-all and it shouldn't be a free-for-all."" The government is ""very confident"" that it is on ""strong ground"" defending the current benefits criteria, he added. Labour, which introduced the right-to-reside rules in 2004 in response to concerns about EU enlargement, said the residence test should be strengthened. ""Most people who come to Britain work and contribute,"" shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said. ""But it is right that we should have checks in place to make sure people contribute or show commitment to this country before they benefit."" In one case it is claimed an EU national who had been working and paying taxes in the UK was refused jobseekers' allowance after she was made redundant. Refused allowance One UK-based charity - Advice on Individual Rights in Europe - said it had dealt with a number of women who had worked in the UK but were denied income support when they became pregnant. ""British and Irish citizens always pass this so-called right-to-reside test,"" the charity's legal director Adam Weiss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Other EU citizens do not always pass that test and as a result they are often refused certain benefits in circumstances when British citizens and Irish citizens would receive them."" Jonathan Portes, from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said studies suggested migrants to the UK are ""significantly less likely"" to claim benefits than British nationals. He said EU migrants pay at least 30% more in taxes than they take out in benefits, according to research by University College London. The case has infuriated some who already believe Brussels interferes too much in UK government policy. 'Specifically excluded' Peter Lilley was the Conservative minister in charge of social security when the ""habitual residence"" test, which is allowed under EU law, was introduced in the UK. He said the European Commission was ""creeping"" into areas of policy that were ""specifically excluded"" from European treaties, adding that the move would ""strengthen the case for David Cameron to get powers back to this country"". Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, which argues for the UK's withdrawal from the EU, said the commission's decision showed that ""in a Britain versus European Union fight, we just don't win"". The government recently announced plans for additional curbs on what migrants to the UK should be allowed to access. The Queen's Speech included a bill to make short-term migrants pay for NHS care, force landlords to check immigration statuses and prevent illegal migrants from obtaining driving licences.",Britain is being taken to court by the European Commission for allegedly discriminating against EU nationals who claim social security in the UK.
"According to a spokesperson, the empty train was departing Central Rivers service depot in Burton-upon-Trent when onboard electrical equipment exploded in a coach cupboard. It was only discovered when the driver moved through the train to change ends at Birmingham New Street Station. The incident is being probed by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch. It happened on board a CrossCountry service at about 06:00 BST on 26 September. The operator said the cause was ""quickly identified"" and minor modifications were made on similar trains.

"Ahead of Remembrance Day, five trains in the ScotRail fleet have become the first to have their normal logos replaced with a special poppy design. The ""poppy trains"" will be used on routes between the seven cities within Scotland. The redesigned logo will remain displayed on the carriages after the end of the remembrance period. Soldiers from the Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Highlanders, two infantry battalions of the Royal Regiment, helped unveil the trains. Alongside poppy sales in some of Scotland's biggest train stations, the carriage logos have been redesigned as the ""latest demonstration"" of ScotRail's support for Poppyscotland's annual appeal. The money raised during the appeal is used to support ex-servicemen and women. The ScotRail Alliance raised more than Â£57,000 for the charity in 2016. Syeda Ghufran, head of engineering projects at the ScotRail Alliance, said she hoped the poppy branding would encourage people ""not just to remember, but also to show their support in practical ways"". ""At this time of year, it's important that we remember those who gave their lives for our country. However, it's just as important to remember those who did come back, and the support that they require,"" she said. Gordon Michie, head of fundraising at Poppyscotland, called the logo redesign ""absolutely fantastic"". He said: ""These trains demonstrate once again that the ScotRail Alliance is going the extra mile in its support of Poppyscotland and those who need our life-changing services.""",ScotRail has joined forces with Poppyscotland to unveil specially-branded Poppy Appeal trains.
"The Department of Health said it was working to ""rapidly increase"" availability, with more tests due to become available on Saturday. Downing Street said 5,000 home testing kits were ordered in the first two minutes of the website going live. About 15,000 tests were booked to take place on Friday at drive-through sites. No 10 said the total amount of home testing kits available on Friday were ordered, adding it hoped to have 18,000 kits available each day for key workers by the ""end of next week"". The website would be back up and running when the next batch of slots become available, the spokesman added. The expanded testing scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Thursday allows all essential workers in England to register for tests on the government's website, if they or a family member have virus symptoms. Up to 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for testing, with the aim of allowing essential staff to safely return to work. Previously, a smaller group of key workers - those whose work is deemed critical to the Covid-19 response - were eligible for testing. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the new system would also apply there ""very soon"", while Wales and Northern Ireland have both announced separate plans to expand testing. Downing Street said the government is trusting that those applying for testing are key workers, with no eligibility checks in place for online bookings. The website opened on Friday but appeared to close by mid-morning with some users met by an ""applications closed"" message. The Department of Health apologised for ""any inconvenience"" caused by the temporary closure of applications. The government remains some way short of its target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day in the UK by the end of this month. Friday's figures showed 28,532 tests were carried out, though Mr Hancock said on Thursday that capacity has reached more than 50,000 a day. The latest data also showed a further 684 people died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 19,506. In Wales the total number of people confirmed to have died with coronavirus reached 751, an increase of more than 100 for the first time. However, Public Health Wales said the 110 deaths reported on Friday included 84 that had been added retrospectively ""due to a delay in the reporting process"". A mixed picture Secondary school teacher Mike Eyre, from Boston in Lincolnshire, was one of the first people to apply for a test but told the BBC he was still waiting for confirmation about where to go 11 hours later. ""It was very easy to log on and register,"" he said. ""It just said that you would then receive a text, which would take a few minutes but it might take a little bit longer if it's busy. ""I've still not had a text yet, so I'm assuming they're very busy."" Liz Christie, an education adviser from Slough in Berkshire, applied at about 06:45 BST and heard back at about midday on Friday. She will make the 30-mile round-trip to a drive-in centre in Wembley, north London, later. She told BBC News that she ""didn't expect it to be completely smooth"" on the first day, and said she was ""pleased that in less than 48 hours I'll have been tested and know if I'm positive or not"". ""We've been able to work from home but they've asked if I can go in next week, so it would be useful to know,"" she said. ""My children are both asthmatic - and getting a test would also mean I could then go and help my mum, who has almost no immune system and is getting no help in the house."" John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, described the announcement as ""long overdue and very welcome"". He added that testing would enable self-isolating officers ""to get back onto the front line to assist their colleagues if the test comes back as negative"". Also among those to qualify for tests are staff at supermarkets, where absences due to coronavirus have been a big issue. Tesco currently has more than 41,000 staff members off work. The British Retail Consortium said the testing of such workers was ""crucial"" to ""maintain good supplies to stores"". Transport for London (TfL) - where a third of employees have been ill or have had to self-isolate since the start of the pandemic - said that while testing would not be mandatory, it was ""encouraging the take-up of testing by all eligible members of staff"". Mr Hancock said once people entered their details online they would be sent a text or email inviting them to either book an appointment at a drive-through centre or to request a home test kit, though the latter are currently in limited supply. He told BBC Breakfast the home kits would be collected by courier and would initially start in ""small numbers"" before the service grows. A help desk has been established to aid the process, while mobile units run by the Army are travelling around the country to where they are needed, such as care homes. Can I get a test? Anyone classified as an ""essential worker"" who is showing symptoms can request a test in England. The list includes NHS and social care staff, teachers, police officers and transport workers. They and their family can also request a test if someone in their household shows symptoms. How will I be tested? The test involves taking a swab of the nose and the back of the throat. There are two ways to get a test: at a testing site, or with a home testing kit. Home kits will initially be limited but are being sent to NHS staff. Most people will get their test results by text within two days. When can I go back to work? Provided you and/or those in your household have not tested positive, you can go back to work. That is so long as you are well enough and have not had a high temperature for 48 hours. Mr Hancock has said the ""majority"" of people will get their result in 24 hours, but for some it might take a bit longer. The result will be added to a person's medical record so their doctor is informed, he added. Key workers who are unable to access the government's website will still be able to apply for a test, as employers are able to book on behalf of their staff. Until now, hospitals have been carrying out tests, along with a network of about 30 drive-through centres in car parks, airports and sports grounds. Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers should have been prepared for the surge in demand for coronavirus tests. There is no doubting the scale and ambition of this project - up to 10 million essential workers and their families invited to go online if they have symptoms to book a virus test. Ensuring the system can smoothly book people their tests at drive in centres and then get results back within 48 hours will be a major technological challenge. Some may complain that the drive-in centres are not accessible but the plan will soon involve home testing kits being sent to people to do their own swabs and send them back for laboratory testing. The home testing kits are currently going out to NHS workers. Then government says this will be extended very soon to the wider group. Mobile pop-up test facilities will go to workplaces. In theory this will make a big difference to key workers self-isolating because a member of their household is unwell - if that individual tests negative then others in the home can get back to work quickly. Or if someone is unsure about their symptoms they can easily check whether they have coronavirus. This is a significant move in the drive to boost testing. The question now is whether the IT and the infrastructure can deliver. At Thursday's Downing Street briefing, the health secretary also pledged to recruit 18,000 people to trace those who had been in contact with those infected. Meanwhile, Prof John Newton, co-ordinator of the UK's coronavirus testing programme, said the government is ""on track"" to reach 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.

"By Sarah Jenkins and Kevin PeacheyBBC News Calculation mistakes were made during the process of moving people from incapacity benefit and severe disability allowance on to employment and support allowance (ESA). The average rebate is about Â£5,000. But some claimants are unsure if they are due a payout. Who has been affected? Most underpayments occurred between 2011 and 2014, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said. It affects those who were not considered for income-related ESA when they were switched to contributory ESA. These people may have missed out on other payments, such as the enhanced disability premium. How do claimants know if they are entitled to a rebate? Anyone affected will be contacted by the DWP and all backdated payments should be made by the end of 2019. A spokesman for the department said the process of contacting people entitled to repayments may take some time. There are 400 DWP officials working through cases, with more expected to be employed in the next month. What if a claimant has died? Jeanette, from Hull, told the BBC her husband received ESA for two years while he was undergoing treatment for lung cancer. She questioned whether the backdated payment would still be made as he died in 2012. ""My frustration is that the extra money would have been really helpful at the time,"" she said. ""I had to give up work to care for my husband and all our savings went out the window."" While the DWP is unable to comment on specific cases, it did say in instances where the benefit recipient had died, the calculations would still be completed and any payment would be made to the next of kin. Will a rebate affect benefit entitlements? Keith, from Somerset, received a backdated payment of Â£23,000. He was concerned the lump sum would mean a drop in his benefits leaving him worse-off in the long term. ""I received a letter a couple of weeks ago which said I was owed money,"" he said. ""My worry is that I will move on to universal credit some time next year and they might take money away from me. ""It feels like they are giving with one hand and taking away with the other."" The DWP said any payments under Â£5,000 would not be considered when other benefit entitlement is calculated - but any payments above that figure would only be disregarded for one year.","Questions have been raised from benefits claimants after the government revealed that 180,000 people are entitled to back-payments following years of errors."
"By Michael StoddardBBC News, Southampton The automatic alarm has gone off at three in the morning and alerted the emergency services. But instead of a fire engine turning up and a crew of firefighters racing to put out the flames, a crew manager arrives in a car before deciding if a fire engine is needed. This could be the future in Hampshire if the predicted budget cuts of up to 40% become a reality in Wednesday's government Spending Review, the Fire Brigades' Union (FBU) has warned. The south coast force has recently experienced first-hand the dangers firefighters can face, with the deaths of two crew members at a block of flats in April. James Shears, 35, and Alan Bannon, 38, died while tackling the blaze which started on the ninth floor of Shirley Towers in Southampton. But like every service across the country it has to make savings. It has drawn up plans to save Â£16.8m by 2015 from an annual budget currently of about Â£68m. The FBU claims this means up to 190 of the 800 full-time frontline firefighters in the county could be axed. Hampshire Fire Service refused to comment on any potential job losses but has said it will do all it can to avoid compulsory redundancies. But it has gone public with the idea of not initially sending fire engines to a range of incidents. Fire chiefs believe sending a manager in a vehicle to automatic fire alarms - which they claim are often false - and small fires, will save time and ultimately cut costs if resources are not needed. Managers will also be sent to some road accidents to asses what extra resources may be needed on top of the usual response, which will still include a fire engine. But the FBU said any delay in life-saving equipment getting to the scene could cost lives and make more work for the crews following behind. Dean Marshall's farm shop in Bordon was destroyed by fire in March. Mr Marshall, who said the fire service did all it could in his case, explained that he was concerned about the new plans. 'Shocked and surprised' ""I can understand the service receive a great deal of hoax calls and this must be a waste of resources,"" he said. ""[But] in our own recent experience we would have been shocked and surprised [not to see a fire engine arrive first]."" Fire chiefs want to start piloting the idea from April next year in rural areas, with cities like Portsmouth and Southampton next in line. Conrad Jordan, acting chair of the Hampshire FBU, said the plans should be shelved. ""We feel this is dangerous, you always send a fire engine because if you do need heavy equipment you don't want a delay. ""We don't know how minor or major an incident is when the call comes in, it could be anything, but the point is you plan for worse and hope for the best. ""General perception from the public is if they have a fire, they want to see a fire engine, not a man in a van."" Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service has refused to comment ahead of the Spending Review but referred to a publication recently sent to all employees. In it John Bonney, chief fire officer, said protecting the public was always the service's priority in the face of any cuts. He wrote: ""We will be hit, and it will hurt. ""Blind cuts to the service will help no-one, but some difficult decisions and hard thinking about reducing costs cannot be avoided. ""The simple fact is that we will need to find more savings."" On the moves to stop sending fire engines to the likes of small fires or automatic fire alarms, the fire service said: ""Most small fires do not need the same number of firefighters or the same amount of equipment as needed for a major fire. ""Most AFAs [automatic fire alarms] are false alarms and they take up the time of our firefighters and equipment unnecessarily. ""By developing other ways of responding, we will be able to make better use of our firefighters."" The consultation on the draft plans will run to 10 December and can be viewed on the fire service's website.","It is the moment when your whole life could be going up in flames, a fire has gripped your business."

"By Sian LloydBBC News The Outdoor Partnership offers equipment and qualifications in activities such as kayaking and climbing. Projects are planned for East Ayrshire in Scotland, Newry in Northern Ireland and Cumbria in England. It follows a Â£2,920,462 award from The National Lottery Community Fund. Research by Bangor University showed in 2003 only 7% of instructor posts were filled by local people. Ongoing research is taking place at the university and latest figures provided by the Outdoor Partnership suggest that figures has now risen to 20%. For most of his teenage years, Ryan Gibson was homeless and sleeping rough in Holyhead on Anglesey - now he is a fully qualified climbing instructor and enjoys sharing his passion for the sport with others. ""To be able to get the qualifications and be able to progress was the hardest step for someone from my background, we've always been led to believe that the outdoors was for the middle class really,"" he said. Karina Parry from Llanrwst, Conwy county, added that taking part in group climbing and walking had helped her gain confidence, overcome personal issues and get fit. The charity's chief executive Tracey Evans said: ""The success we've had in north Wales has been achieved by breaking down some of the barriers preventing the local community taking part. ""When we started in Oct 2005 there were only 15 community-based clubs in north west Wales and now there are over 100. ""We wanted to create clear pathways so that if someone was interested in a particular activity they could move from beginner to instructor."" The charity said between 2006 and March 2019 it had reached more than 120,000 people, invested Â£700,000 to train more than 4,500 volunteers and supported more than 500 unemployed people into sustained employment Joe Ferns, director of UK funding at The National Lottery Community Fund, said the grant would ""help more people achieve their potential through outdoor activities and break the cultural cycle where local natural resources are seen as something only for tourists"". ""This project is ultimately helping communities across the UK to thrive,"" he said.",A charity that helps people in Snowdonia find jobs in outdoor pursuits has been awarded almost Â£3m to recreate its work in other mountain communities.
"Only 7% of the 1,145 online abuse cases reported to the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre in 2012 involved people trying to meet a child. Ceop said offenders may target hundreds of victims at a time, and described the abuse as an ""alarming new trend"". The organisation said parents needed to talk to their children about the issue. 'Blind spot' Peter Davies, chief executive of Ceop - which monitors child abuse online - said: ""We've seen a drop in the amount of grooming with a view to meeting offline. That's still a risk but it's a diminishing risk. ""The growth area seems to be grooming, contact, and then sexual abuse purely online. We really need to make sure that young people are target hardened [sic] against that. ""It's amazing, the number of parents I meet who would not think twice about talking to their kids about just about anything else that is risky - but have a blind spot about online."" There were 1,145 reports to Ceop in 2012 relating to incidents of online grooming. However, only 7% of these related to attempting to meet a child offline, a drop from 12% in 2011. Online sexual abuse is commonly conducted via webcams, instant messenger applications and social networking sites. The research by Ceop and the University of Birmingham suggested physical contact did not appear to be a motivation for offenders who sought to abuse children in this way. Ceop said that once initial contact is made, it ""often rapidly escalates into threats and intimidation"". A Ceop spokeswoman said some offenders hack into the accounts of victims and say they will only get their account back if they do what the abuser tells them to do. Thereafter the abuser makes more demands ""so the victim often feels like they haven't got any control... and it ends up in this spiral of continuous abuse"", she added. Mr Davies said the ""devastation"" caused to young people's lives through online grooming could be seen on a daily basis. ""UK children can be targeted from anywhere and offenders will cast their net widely to target large numbers of children,"" he said. 'Trick victims' Ceop's research highlighted the case of two brothers in Kuwait who targeted 110 children worldwide - including 78 in the UK - forcing them into performing sexual acts online. The pair were jailed for blackmail offences last December following a Ceop-led investigation. Ceop said the pair pretended to be someone the children already knew on social networking and instant messaging applications. They would trick victims into giving them online passwords before threatening them into engaging in sexual activities via webcam. There was no evidence of an offline meeting with victims ever being a motivation, Ceop said. Ceop also said that instant messaging on mobile phones was used by paedophiles to contact children in about third of the reports of grooming it saw in 2012. While smart phones were increasingly popular among 12 to 15-year-olds, more than two-thirds of them do not have parental controls installed, it added. Ceop's chief executive said parents and carers had a duty to ensure their children remained safe online. Claire Lilly, of children's charity the NSPCC, said there had been a sharp rise in young people contacting its Childline help service about being approached online. She said: ""What is apparent is that parents and carers can make that vital difference in whether or not a child becomes a victim of these ruthless predators online. ""The internet is part and parcel of young lives... we can talk to young people and educate them on staying safe online just as we do about stranger danger or drugs.""","Children are increasingly being groomed over the internet for the sole purpose of online sexual abuse, research by a child protection watchdog suggests."
"No 10 plans to start televised daily press conferences, like those held at the White House - to be fronted by spokeswoman Allegra Stratton. The Cabinet Office said the spending ""is in the public interest"" as it will ""increase public accountability and transparency."" Labour said it reflected ""Boris Johnson's warped priorities"". It comes as further details emerged about plans to renovate Mr Johnson's Number 10 flat, including possibly asking the public to donate to it. The Cabinet Office issued a breakdown of spending on the briefing room, which totalled Â£2,607,767.67. 'Public interest' The release was a response to a Freedom of Information request made by the Press Association news agency. The money had been spent to allow various news organisations to broadcast from No 9 Downing Street, the Cabinet Office said. ""This will necessarily require one-off capital works, including audio-visual equipment, internet infrastructure, electrical works and lighting,"" a spokesperson said. They added that ""spending on maintenance and technical facilities reflects that 9 Downing Street is a Grade I listed building."" Labour's Angela Rayner contrasted the spending to the government's proposed 1% pay rise for NHS nurses. The party's deputy leader said: ""It would take around 100 years for a newly qualified nurse to get paid this kind of money. ""It sums up Boris Johnson's warped priorities that he can find millions for vanity projects, while picking the pockets of NHS workers. ""Our NHS heroes deserve a fair pay rise after all they have done for us."" New press secretary The FOI release detailed spending of over Â£1.8m for the ""main works"", nearly Â£200,000 for ""long lead items"", and more than Â£33,000 for broadband equipment. The new briefings were expected to begin in the autumn, but have been delayed because of the pandemic. They will be held by the prime minister's press secretary, Allegra Stratton. An advert for her taxpayer-funded role said the salary would be based on experience, but reports suggested pay would be around Â£100,000 a year. At the moment, political reporters based in Parliament, known as lobby correspondents, have daily briefings with the prime minister's official spokesperson, but they are not televised.","Downing Street has spent more than Â£2.6m on fitting out a new media briefing room, it has emerged."
"Shukri Yahye-Abdi, who came to the UK in 2017, died after entering the River Irwell in Bury on 27 June 2019 while holding hands with another child, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Coroner Joanne Kearsley said there was ""no evidence whatsoever"" to suggest that Shukri was pushed into the river. She added that claims Shukri had been bullied were ""totally incorrect"". Shukri's mother Zam Zam Ture said the verdict had not brought ""justice"" for her daughter. Following the inquest, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it did not find evidence to indicate Shukri's family were treated less favourably by police because of their ethnic background. 'Naive and foolish' Shukri's family had claimed she had been pushed into the water by girls who had been bullying her. Her school later said it would review its anti-bullying policy amid concerns raised in the community. Ms Kearlsey said there was no evidence of racist bullying by other children and such claims were ""simply rumours and unhelpful speculation"". She said Shukri had gone into the river while holding hands with Child One and moved into deeper water after the 12-year-old was told she would be taught to swim. She said Child One had been ""naive and foolish"" but what she did did not amount to manslaughter. Shukri's family's lawyer said they would seek a judicial review of the inquest's findings. Ms Ture said she felt ""so bad today"" as she had waited a ""long time for justice"". ""I know what happened to my daughter. I know today I don't have justice, but the justice is coming,"" she added. She had previously claimed institutional racism within Greater Manchester Police (GMP) meant officers failed to carry out a full investigation into her daughter's death. The IOPC said there was ""insufficient evidence on which a case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct for any of the individual officers could be found"". ""Therefore the complaints against GMP are not upheld,"" an IOPC spokeswoman said. 'Clarity and facts' The IOPC's final report said GMP officers had reached the river within three minutes of receiving the report about Shukri being in trouble and taken witness accounts ""almost immediately"". It said officers had visited the 12-year-old's school the following day and ""added relevant information concerning bullying to their investigation"". It added that GMP had ""promptly brought in translation services"" and a family liaison officer had communicated with Shukri's family throughout. IOPC Regional Director Amanda Rowe said the complaints received following the 12-year-old's death ""were treated with the upmost seriousness and very carefully assessed against the evidence available to us"". ""I am satisfied that [GMP's investigation] was carried out in line with national and local policies and procedures,"" she said. She added that while ""nothing we can do or say will bring Shukri back"", she hoped the IOPC's work could give her family ""the clarity and facts they had rightly sought"". In the aftermath of the 12-year-old's death, more than a million people signed a petition about the case, calling for ""justice for Shukri"" and thousands of people attended events marking the anniversary of her death.

"Officials at the national park authority are asking people to the area to clean their boots, bike tyres, cars and dogs after visiting in the area. Fears of the spread of the ash dieback disease have prompted the call. The trees are being attacked by a fungus that can be transmitted by wind, insects and rain splash. Geoff Garrett, the park's senior trees and woodland officer, said: ""Ash is such an important tree in the broadleaved woodlands of the limestone uplands of the Yorkshire Dales that we are treating the potential impact of the disease very seriously. ""It is impossible to say with any accuracy how many well-established ash trees we have in the National Park but it's in the order of hundreds of thousands - perhaps even millions. ""On top of that, we have planted about 250,000 new ones in the last 10 years - and they are all at risk from this disease. ""So far we have found no symptoms of it but we would ask people to take extra care when they are out enjoying this beautiful place. ""If they have to go into an area full of trees, we would ask them not to visit other similar areas within a 24-hour period and to make sure they clean their boots, car and bicycle tyres, dogs and anything else that may have come into contact with leaves or wood.""",Walkers in the Yorkshire Dales are being asked to take precautions to prevent the spread of a disease that is threatening millions of ash trees.

"Figures show last year alone firefighters were sent to 4,200 medical calls - being first on the scene in 1,716 - 41% - of cases. That is three times more than in 2009-10 as pressure on the ambulance service grows. The Welsh Government is considering if the NHS should contribute to the cost. In January a driver injured in a crash in Swansea was taken to hospital by fire engine because no ambulances were available. The number of 999 medical calls attended by fire services across Wales went up from 1,260 in 2009-10 to 4,174 in 2016-17, according to Welsh Government statistics. Last year these calls made up 11% of all incidents attended by Welsh fire services - compared to 2.7% in 2009-10. Fire engines are being sent to medical emergencies instead of ambulances if they are nearer the scene, including some of the most life-threatening calls, such as heart attacks. They are also being sent to non life-threatening cases, such as fractures, in a bid to free up paramedics for urgent calls. Meanwhile in north Wales, as well as checking fire alarms, fire officers are often giving ""preventative"" health advice on preventing trips, alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, smoking and poor diet. Currently fire and rescue services in mid, north and south Wales are funded by contributions from local authorities and the Welsh Government. But local government and public services minister Alun Davies is looking at changing this, seeing if the NHS should help fund the fire service in the face of its growing use for health support. He is looking at funding as part of a review of Wales' fire and rescue authorities (FRAS) - who set priorities and budgets for Wales' three fire services - which he said were outdated and unaccountable to the electorate. But he ruled out handing control of fire services to police and crime commissioners. In the letter to the heads of the fire authorities, Mr Davies writes: ""It may be hard to justify purely local funding when an increasing amount of an FRA's work is done in support of the NHS. ""If you feel the NHS should make a consistent and agreed contribution to that work, I am happy to discuss that with my colleagues"". A letter to Mr Davies, signed by all the chairs of the authorities, said: ""We feel very strongly that, if we are to realise our emerging role in respect of supporting the NHS, then it may not be solely the FRAs who must undergo reform. ""If Welsh Government is serious about innovation to meet the severe pressures on the NHS then we will need full commitment across all relevant areas of the NHS, including political leaders. ""We see little evidence of this at the moment."" In north Wales the fire service said the pilot for a scheme which saw firefighters help people who had fallen across Conwy and Denbighshire is due to end this month after a bid for Welsh Government funding failed. Another trial that saw firefighters work alongside paramedics to respond to 999 calls ended in August 2017 amidst negotiations about firefighters' pay. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We have made clear our long-standing commitment to reform the governance and funding of the fire service in Wales. ""At present, fire and rescue authorities are not accountable to the electorate, or national and local government, and this needs to be addressed in order to further enhance local democracy.""",A rise in the number of 999 medical emergencies attended by firefighters has led to plans being considered for the NHS to contribute to the cost.
"The Great Western Air Ambulance (GWAA) lacks the power to take-off from the helipad at Bristol Royal Infirmary, which opened on Wednesday. The helicopter currently lands at a site on the Clifton Downs - a 1.6 mile (2.5 km) drive from the hospital. The charity which operates the helicopter said it had managed to raise Â£250,000 to lease a new helicopter. The GWAA is the last air ambulance charity in England to rely exclusively on the BÃ¶lkow Bo105 helicopter. 'Maximise fund raising' But to test land at the BRI's new Â£3m facility, the charity had to strip out all of its kit and have just one crew member onboard its current 1960s helicopter. ""It's old and hasn't got enough power,"" said Emma Carter, the charity's fund raising manager. ""But we've managed to raise Â£250,000 to secure an EC 135 helicopter for six months, which will be with us in late summer."" The new helicopter, according to the charity, will not only be able to land on elevated helipads but reach patients four minutes faster and allow a mother and child to fly to hospital together. ""The BÃ¶lkow is also rear loading and it can take 15 to 20 minutes to load a patient but with the EC 135 you can just slide the patient in,"" added Ms Carter. ""But now we really have to maximise our fundraising because our current helicopter costs Â£1.5m a year to run, while the new one will cost Â£2m."" The new platform, which serves six air ambulance providers, will also be linked to the adult emergency department at the BRI, the neighbouring Bristol Children's Hospital and the nearby Bristol Heart Institute.",An air ambulance unable to use a new Bristol hospital helipad will be replaced later this summer.
"Siaron Lowis Bonds, 26, was treated at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor for blood cancer in 1994 but died two days after her chemotherapy treatment began. New evidence and law changes prompted a new inquest in Caernarfon. But a coroner said ""it was not possible to say"" if Ms Bonds would have survived had staff spotted complications sooner. Ms Bonds had high grade non-Hodgkins adult lymphoblastic lymphoma, and developed a complication called Acute Tumour Lysis Syndrome (ATLS). A consultant who treated her said that had blood tests been carried out earlier, complications could have been diagnosed sooner. Ms Bonds, from Llanrug, Gwynedd, died from ATLS, which can occur when the rapid breakdown of cancer cells causes substances to be released into the bloodstream more quickly than the kidneys can remove them. The inquest heard from one doctor who said ""the tumour must have just melted with the chemotherapy"", releasing high levels of potassium into her bloodstream. Coroner Joanne Lees said ""opportunities were missed to identify ATLS, to administer treatment and to optimise her chances of survival"". ""It is not possible to say that Siaron would have survived, had ATLS been identified earlier,"" she said. ""After chemotherapy she was not monitored regularly. No blood tests were taken until after a rapid deterioration which then identified ATLS. ""Her condition was initially misdiagnosed as chemotherapy induced sickness and associated anxiety. That blood test, sadly, was way too late."" The coroner said Ms Bonds should have been given fluid via a drip in more time before the chemotherapy, and staff on duty during the night did not call a specialist when her condition deteriorated. ""I find that Siaron Bonds died from a known side effect of life-saving chemotherapy treatment,"" Ms Lees concluded. Ms Bonds' sister Glenda Murray thanked those who had supported the family during the inquest, adding: ""Finally, some partial answers to concerns which have troubled us for nearly 25 years. ""We also trust that the findings will be acted upon and therefore ensure that no such tragedy will ever happen again. ""No facts that were disclosed will ever make up for the premature loss of Siaron, a beautiful young woman and a cherished daughter and sister.""

"Just under 40% of state schools and colleges have placed orders since it was launched in England in January. The government says the opt-in scheme has operated throughout the pandemic. But campaigners say it should be promoted more as schools return. Gemma Abbott, from the Free Periods group, said ""many schools and students [are] still not aware"" of the scheme, which aims to help prevent children in colleges, primary and secondary schools missing lessons if they don't have access to products at home. ""The government also needs to take some responsibility for the fact that more than 60% of eligible schools and colleges have yet to sign up to the scheme,"" she said - adding that Free Periods has ""hardly heard anything"" from the Department for Education (DfE) since the initiative's launch. ""If DfE really is committed to ensuring that 'no young person's education is disrupted by their period', as they said back in January, then they need to make much more effort to ensure that schools and colleges know about the scheme, that they place orders for products and that they distribute those products efficiently and sensitively to students who need them."" She added that the government had suggested that the ""opt-in"" nature of the scheme would be reconsidered if there was insufficient uptake. ""If these stats have not improved quite drastically by October half-term, this surely needs to be considered,"" she said. Institutions that opt in can order from a range of items online, via email or over the phone using an allocated budget for 2020. The DfE said it expects uptake ""to return to pre-lockdown levels"" when children go back to lessons - and that some schools did continue to operate the scheme during lockdown. Benfield School in Newcastle is one of those. It stayed open for keyworker children, but staff delivered products to the homes of pupils who were eligible for free school meals. However, assistant head teacher Sarah Wardle said with schools facing so much turmoil, tackling period poverty may not be a priority or a possibility for others. She thinks making it mandatory for schools to use the scheme - and to educate about periods more broadly - would increase uptake. ""It might be that it needs to come to that so that staff sit up and say 'we need to do something about this',"" she said, adding she expects demand to rise in September. ""Some of our students' parents might have just been earning enough in terms of them not being able to access free school meals. I think one of the issues when we come back is that those people who were just on the cusp might have lost their jobs, might not be working, and there will be a need."" The scheme is demand-led, so uptake is monitored and used to determine spending. Phs Group, which supplies the products for the government's scheme and runs the online portal for orders, said it expects uptake to ""rise considerably"" in September. Warren Edmondson, managing director of phs Direct, called the scheme is a ""major achievement"" in tackling period poverty, but added: ""The onus is now on schools and colleges to claim their free products and orders must be received by the end of the autumn term."" Amika George, who started the campaign to get free period products into schools as a teenager, said the government needs to do more to promote it, particularly as the pandemic has been a ""disaster"" for those who were already struggling to afford products. ""Household incomes have been squeezed and with so many jobs feeling fragile, children are not even asking their parents for money for pads,"" she said, adding that young people may have lost part-time jobs to buy their own. She wants the government to contact schools and offer help if they are not ordering through the scheme. According to research by charity Plan International, three in 10 girls in the UK have experienced issues either affording or accessing period products during the pandemic, while one in five said their periods have been harder to manage due to the lack of available toilet roll. The charity's Katie Morrison said that while coronavirus is one factor affecting uptake, some schools may not see period poverty as a relevant issue or priority for their pupils. ""Others may want to engage, but don't know how to go about it,"" she said. The charity has released guidance for schools going back in September, which advises on how to deliver free product schemes and to facilitate discussions about what pupils need. The England scheme mirrors one already rolled out in Scotland which launched last year, following a pilot scheme that gave free tampons and towels to low-income households in Aberdeen. Wales introduced funding for free period products in schools from April 2019 and committed more than Â£3.3m in January this year to tackle period poverty and support period dignity in 2020/21. A spokeswoman for the Welsh government added that before schools and colleges were closed in March, officials directed all local authorities and further education colleges to provide students with three months' supply of products where needed. One local authority in Northern Ireland offers free products in public places.","Charities say many schools and colleges are not aware they can order free period products through a government scheme, amid concerns Covid-19 has left more pupils struggling to access and afford tampons and pads."
"The party's conference voted to replace the pound with a separate Scottish currency ""as soon as practicable"". This went against the wishes of leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had wanted a more gradual transition to a new currency. Ms Sturgeon played down the result of the vote, and said the party could ""move forward with confidence"". Party members also backed the leadership over six economic tests that will ""guide"" the exact timescale for a new currency - which some left-wing activists had wanted scrapped. It means that the SNP's official policy is, for the first time, to replace sterling with a new Scottish currency after independence. It comes just days after Ms Sturgeon announced that she wants a second independence referendum within the next two years, if Brexit happens. However the UK government has ruled out granting the Scottish Parliament the consent that would ensure any referendum was legal. What happened at the conference? Delegates in Edinburgh were asked to back proposals put forward by deputy leader Keith Brown and Finance Secretary Derek Mackay, which were largely based on the SNP's Growth Commission report. Their motion said that the currency of an independent Scotland ""should continue to be the pound sterling"" until a separate currency ""can be safely and securely established"". The aim should then have been for the Scottish Parliament to take a decision on whether to establish a new currency ""by the end of the first term of an independent Parliament"". Pleas from the leadership not to amend the motion were ignored by a majority of party members, who voted by 781 to 729 for a new currency to instead be introduced ""as soon as practicable"". However the amendment, by the SNP's Dalkeith and District Branch, kept the vast majority of the leadership's proposals - including the use of six key economic tests that will ""guide"" the precise timescale for a new currency. These were set out by the party's Growth Commission, and include an independent Scotland having a ""sufficiently strong and credible fiscal position in relation to budget deficit and overall debt"" before a separate currency is introduced. And there would need to be evidence that the new currency would ""meet the ongoing needs of Scottish residents and businesses"". The tests were kept despite activist Timothy Rideout, who spoke for the amendment, describing them as ""rubbish"". Mr Rideout also argued that the use of Sterling would mean monetary policy such as interest rates would all be set in London, and that ""we would not have real independence"". What has been the reaction of the leadership? Ms Sturgeon, who will address the conference on Sunday afternoon, tweeted after the vote that: ""We can move forward now with confidence to make the case for Scotland's future in Scotland's hands."" Her deputy, Keith Brown, insisted that the SNP now has a ""clear platform on which to campaign and win the case for independence"". He added: ""Our party now sees the balance of advantage in a careful, managed and responsible transition to an independent currency. ""It is our ambition to move to a new currency - this is a significant and important policy choice. Until this can be achieved, safely and securely, our currency will remain the pound sterling."" Mr Brown predicted: ""This is a winning economic plan to take to the doorsteps - one which will achieve independence for Scotland."" Why does this matter? The policy shift marks a major change from the SNP's stance ahead of the 2014 independence referendum, when then-first minister Alex Salmond said Scotland would continue to use the pound in a formal UK-wide currency union. This was immediately ruled out by the UK government - with the resulting uncertainty over what currency an independent Scotland would use widely seen as being a factor in independence being rejected by 55% to 45%. The new plan would see Scotland keep the pound, at least in the short term, but without a currency union - and with a new currency being introduced ""as soon as practicable"" afterwards. What have the other parties had to say? Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the vote was an ""embarrassing snub"" for Ms Sturgeon, who he claimed was ""now at the beck and call of an extreme economic agenda within the SNP which would rip the pound from our pockets as soon as possible"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said it was ""imposing a decade of austerity on the most vulnerable, tax cuts for big business and fewer rights for workers is now official SNP policy."" Scottish Green co-convener Patrick Harvie said it was ""no great surprise that SNP members felt the need to defeat their leadership's uninspiring Growth Commission proposals"", and that the case for independence needed a ""new economic direction"" than the ""centrist agenda"". And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Ms Sturgeon has ""lost control of her party"", with the leadership ""now committed to a policy they oppose and that will affect pensions and mortgages"".",The SNP has backed proposals for a new currency in an independent Scotland - although the leadership was defeated over the timing.
"But the designer from Fife has worked hard to ""turn a negative into a positive"". She is using the shapes and pattern from her own MRI scans - which highlight the lesions on her brain - to create a unique line of jewellery, silk scarves and screen prints. And her work has caught the attention of the people behind the new V&A Museum in Dundee, which is due to open next year. She is one of a series of inspirational artists made design champions for the museum. Interviewed on BBC Radio Scotland, the 31-year-old told the Kaye Adams Programme that she was ""amazed"" by the honour. Ms Stevens was diagnosed with the degenerative condition when she was in her third year of a jewellery and metal design course at Duncan of Jordanstone College in Dundee. ""It first began when I was studying,"" she said. ""My eye sight in my left eye went fuzzy which then led to not being able to see out of it at all. My balance was off, I wasn't quite with it."" She added: ""Over the months I got more relapses, the nerves in my face went a little bit funny - I could feel them twitching - my eye went a bit funny again. ""Then all of a sudden, they diagnosed me with MS, which I wasn't expecting at all. Because I had no clue what it was really, I thought it was an old person's condition."" It was a terrible shock for the student who had just turned 21. She said: ""I thought that was my life over, I was going to end up in a wheelchair, I wasn't going to be able to do anything for myself but it's not like that,"" she said. ""It affects everybody differently but I'm one of the lucky ones, I've not been affected as badly as I could have been. ""Fatigue is the main thing for me. It just hits you out of the blue and your whole body just feels exhausted so you just think 'okay I'm not doing anything today'. ""And also if I'm stressed or tired again my cognitive functions - like speech - I can't think of the one word I need to say, or whatever."" 'Beautiful patterns' After taking a year out to come to terms with the diagnosis, she started searching for ideas for projects for her final year. She said: ""I read in a magazine for future trends that it was all about science and I thought - how can I use that? I could use me - a little bit self-obsessed! ""So I went to my MS nurse and asked for my MRI scans. She was a bit confused and I explained that I just wanted to make beautiful patterns and design jewellery from them and to raise awareness of MS."" Her work includes an ""emperor brain moth"" necklace, which is made using a scan of her entire brain. She mirrored it, flipped it upside down and created a moth-like shape, with eyes made from the lesions. ""I'm making positive out of those nasty little things,"" she said. ""Each scan is a slice through my brain. I think there are 30-odd images but they are all so different and you can see these white blobs which are the lesions - and I just take those shapes and play about with them and create beautiful things. ""I'm really amazed by some of the beautiful patterns that I can make from it."" Ms Stevens added: ""When I was first diagnosed, I was embarrassed, I didn't want to tell people, I was kind of ashamed, which is really silly. ""Now I'm proud to be able to tell them that I've made this from a debilitating condition and I hope it also inspires other people with MS as well.""","When Kirsty Stevens was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 10 years ago, she admits that she thought her life was over."

However, he later said the situation was fluid, but was hopeful an agreement could be reached ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the full council. And council leader George Alexander told BBC Scotland he and other independents were still hopeful a deal could be reached to avoid a minority administration.

"The committee has been examining the Criminal Verdicts Bill, which would scrap not proven and increase the majority needed for jury trial convictions from eight to ten. Most committee members backed the removal of the not proven verdict. But they did not support increasing the jury trial conviction requirement. The committee concluded this should be considered alongside other reforms recommended by former High Court judge Lord Bonomy. Lord Bonomy led an expert group considering what safeguards would need to be put in place if plans to abolish the corroboration requirement in Scotland's criminal justice system went ahead. The committee said it could not therefore back the general principles of the members' bill, which was introduced by Labour MSP Michael McMahon. What is the not proven verdict? The justice committee heard evidence that there was no legal difference between a not guilty and not proven verdict. But it was told that not proven could carry a stigma for an accused person as well as fail to provide the necessary closure for victims. The committee also concluded that the verdict is not always well understood and can cause confusion for both jurors and the public. Its report said: ""We note views that this confusion can lead to the effective defamation of the accused where the public believes the not proven verdict implies a degree of culpability; that the accused, in colloquial terms, ""got away with it"". ""The committee acknowledges that a not proven verdict may have social and indeed employment consequences that a not guilty verdict does not."" Committee convener Christine Grahame said the bill had ""shone a light on the ambiguities of the not proven verdict and raised serious questions as to whether the verdict serves any useful purpose."" 'Deeply unsatisfactory' She added: ""Not proven is often deeply unsatisfactory for victims and no better for those acquitted on it. ""Like most members of the committee, I believe the not proven verdict is on borrowed time. ""But changes to majority verdict requirement raise complex questions that should be considered alongside other reforms, currently under consideration by Lord Bonomy."" Supporters of the three verdict system, including several members of the justiciary, have argued that not proven could safeguard against wrongful conviction in cases where jurors are not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty but may wish to put down a marker that they are uncomfortable with declaring the accused innocent. But Victim Support Scotland told that the committee that they believed it to be ""unsettling that juries neither seem to understand the not proven verdict, nor use it in the way in which they should.""","Scotland's not proven verdict is on ""borrowed time"" and may not serve any useful purpose, Holyrood's justice committee has concluded."

"The Social Mobility Commission said it uncovered ""stark differences"" between how groups progress into work. Some minorities have higher jobless rates, although poorer white boys are least likely to go to university. Alan Milburn, chair of the Commission, said the British 'social mobility promise' was being broken. ""British families are told that if their children go to school and work hard, they will be rewarded with good jobs and opportunities. But for many groups this promise is being broken,"" says the commission's report. ""In recent months, the low educational attainment of White British boys has gained significant attention. However, when it comes to the transition from education to employment, this group is less likely to be unemployed and to face social immobility than their female counterparts, black students and young Asian Muslims."" The study was carried out by education think-tanks LKMco and Education Datalab, looking at how students progress through schooling, if they go on to sixth form and university, and how their achievements translate into jobs. An uneven journey White boys from poorer backgrounds perform badly throughout the education system and are the worst performers at primary and secondary school, the report said. Black children, despite starting school with the same level of maths and literacy as other ethnic groups, are most likely to fail maths GCSE. Black boys face extremely high levels of school exclusion and perform substantially worse than their female peers. And the report said that young black people also have the lowest outcomes in science, maths and technology A-levels and are the least likely ethnic group to achieve a good degree at university. It is disadvantaged young people from white British backgrounds who are the least likely to access Higher Education. Only one in 10 of the poorest go to university, compared to three in 10 for black Caribbean children, five in 10 for Bangladeshis and nearly seven in 10 for Chinese students on the lowest incomes. But after school, it is young women from Pakistani and Bangladeshi backgrounds that are particularly affected. Despite succeeding throughout education and going to university, they are less likely to find top jobs and are paid less than women from other ethnic minorities, the report concluded. 'A long way from level playing field' The Commission has called for action from government, educators and employers to narrow these gaps. It has also published a list of recommendations, including avoiding setting in school and targeting specific groups to try and improve the system. Mr Milburn said: ""The British social mobility promise is that hard work will be rewarded. This research suggests that promise is being broken for too many people in our society. ""Britain is a long way from having a level playing field of opportunity for all, regardless of gender, ethnicity or background.

"Raychel Ferguson from Londonderry died at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children 18 years ago. Northern Ireland's attorney general has directed the coroner to open a new inquest into her death.

The Western Health Trust said it would not comment on individual cases but it ""always cooperates fully and openly in every coroner's inquest.""

Raychel's parents Ray and Marie Ferguson have long campaigned to find out the truth about their daughter's death. A previous inquest into their daughter's death held in 2003 was a ""shambles"", said Mrs Ferguson. 'Reluctance to acknowledge failings' She said a number of key documents were at that time withheld from the coroner.

Last year an inquiry into the deaths of five children in Northern Ireland hospitals, including Raychel, found her death was avoidable. The 14-year-long Inquiry Into Hyponatraemia-related Deaths was heavily critical of the ""self-regulating and unmonitored"" health service. In his report, Mr Justice O'Hara found there was a ""reluctance among clinicians to openly acknowledge failings"" in Raychel's death. He said Raychel's death was the result of ""negligent care"". 'Leaving no stone unturned' In 2013, the Western Health and Social Care Trust admitted liability for her death.

"By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News Born in Yorkshire, Brenda Hale is a grammar school girl whose parents were both head teachers. She achieved the only starred first in her year at the University of Cambridge, before going on to be the youngest person and first woman to be appointed to the Law Commission. Lady Hale played a significant role in introducing a number of reforms to the law, including the Children Act 1989, which is widely acknowledged as the UK's most important piece of legislation protecting children. In 2004, she became the first woman to be appointed as a Law Lord. When the Law Lords - who had sat in parliament as the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords - were given a new home in 2009, with the establishment of the UK Supreme Court, she became its first female justice. In 2013, she became its first deputy president and today becomes its first female president. But her route to becoming the most senior judge in the UK has been anything but conventional. First woman appointed as UK's top judge Unlike her fellow Supreme Court justices, Lady Hale spent many years in academia rather than legal practice. She remains an educator to the core. In 1966, she became an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester, where her interests were in social welfare and family law. She remained at the university for 18 years while also qualifying as a barrister. It is no surprise that she did so by achieving the highest mark in her year in the Bar Final exams in 1969. She followed this by developing a part-time practice in family law, which she managed to combine with her academic work. With her burgeoning CV, it was perhaps only a matter of time before she was appointed a judge in the family division of the High Court. She was the first academic - yet another first - to achieve such a move in 1994. She continued to play a role in legislative reforms, such as the introduction of the Family Law Act 1996, which covered domestic violence, and the Mental Health Act 2005. Lady Hale has always been acutely aware of the need for judges to be drawn from a diverse group within society. She has been all too conscious that diversity has been a stubbornly difficult problem for the judiciary to overcome and that it remains a major issue. Figures on judicial diversity released on Thursday show some progress in the last three years among senior judges. The percentage of female judges in the Court of Appeal has risen from 18% to 24%, and from 18% to 22% in the High Court. But there is still a woeful lack of diversity, with just 28% of court judges being female and only 7% coming from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Shortly after her appointment as the first female Law Lord in 2004, while speaking in a lecture, she said the gender and ethnicity of judges matters ""because democracy matters"". ""We are the instrument by which the will of Parliament and government is enforced upon the people. It does matter that judges should be no less representative of the people than the politicians and civil servants who govern us."" 'Quadrangle to quadrangle' But she hasn't always been so diplomatic. In 2011, with typical candour, she said she found it ""quite shocking"" that so many senior judges were members of the all-male Garrick Club, a private members' club in London's West End. She suggested its popularity might contribute to male dominance of the bench, thanks to ""personal network relationships"". She has talked about the background of her fellow senior judges, who have moved from public school to Oxbridge colleges, to the Inns of Court, as being ""from quadrangle, to quadrangle, to quadrangle"". She acknowledges that she herself is part of the quadrangle by dint of going to Cambridge. As a Supreme Court justice she has been the court's magnetic north on matters of family law. In 2011, in the housing case Yemshaw v LB Hounslow, she gave the lead judgement ruling that domestic violence was not limited to physical violence. In 2014, she effectively broadened the definition of what amounts to a deprivation of liberty for those who lack mental capacity and are detained in care homes and other institutions, writing famously in her judgement that ""a gilded cage is still a cage"". There has also been controversy. Lady Hale was criticised by Brexiteers for comments in a lecture to students in Malaysia, in which she appeared to speculate on aspects of legal questions in the Article 50 case before it had been heard by the court. She was forced to say publicly that she would not recuse herself from the case. She now faces huge challenges. Most importantly, she will have to steward the UK Supreme Court through the Brexit and post-Brexit period in which it will have to determine the weight to be given to decisions of the European Court of Justice. The UK's relationship with what is in effect the Supreme Court of the EU remains highly contentious, and the eyes of the pro-Brexit press, in particular, will focus laser-like on decisions of our own Supreme Court on issues of EU law. If she receives some personal criticism in the press, that will not be a first.","Forthright in her views and a champion of diversity, Baroness Hale is a trailblazer whose life has been full of firsts."
"The ex-Army officer, from London, had been rescued 30 miles shy of his goal. His wife Joanna said she felt ""heartbroken sadness"" after he died of ""complete organ failure"". Mr Worsley, 55, was trying to complete the unfinished journey of his hero, Sir Ernest Shackleton, 100 years later, but in his final audio message, he said: ""My summit is just out of reach."" In that last broadcast, sent from Antarctica on Friday, he told supporters: ""When my hero, Ernest Shackleton, was 97 miles from the South Pole on the morning of January the 9th 1909, he said he'd shot his bolt. ""Well, today I have to inform you with some sadness that I too have shot my bolt."" Mr Worsley said his journey had ended because he did not have the ability to ""slide one ski in front of the other"". ""I will lick my wounds, they will heal over time and I will come to terms with the disappointment,"" he added. 'Grinding down' Prince William has led the tributes to Mr Worsley, who was raising money for the Endeavour Fund, a charity which helps wounded servicemen and women and is managed by the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. The duke, who was patron of the expedition, said he and Prince Harry had lost a friend, as he paid tribute to Mr Worsley's ""selfless commitment"" to fellow soldiers. ""He was a man who showed great courage and determination and we are incredibly proud to be associated with him,"" he said. The princes pledged to ensure Mr Worsley's family, which includes his two children, Max, 21, and Alicia, 19, received the support needed ""at this terribly difficult time"". Mr Worsley was airlifted off the ice on Saturday, on day 71 and 913 miles (1,469km) into his trek. Initially, it was thought he was dehydrated and malnourished. It was only discovered he was suffering from a serious infection - bacterial peritonitis - when he was treated at Union Glacier base camp. He was then flown to a hospital in Punta Arenas, Chile, to undergo surgery but died on Sunday. Peritonitis is inflammation of the peritoneum, the thin layer of tissue that lines the inside of the abdomen. According to the NHS, most cases come from injury or infection in another part of the body. On Instagram, David Beckham said he was ""lucky to have met Henry"", who had ""served our country for so many years"". And adventurer Bear Grylls tweeted: ""We are devastated by this loss. One of the strongest men & bravest soldiers I know. Praying for his special family."" Gen Sir Nick Carter - the head of the Army and a close friend of the explorer - said Mr Worsley had ""extraordinary traits of courage and determination"" but he did it all with the ""most extraordinary modesty and humility"". Polar explorer Pen Hadow told the BBC that Mr Worsley, by going solo with no resupply, had embarked on the ""hardest form of travel quite possibly on the surface of the earth"". He said his body would not have had enough time to replenish itself during the rest periods, which meant ""losing a small percentage of your capability every day"". But he said the ""single hardest challenge"" on such a journey was ""managing your mind-set"". Mr Worsley began the coast-to-coast trek in November, pulling a sledge containing his food, tent and equipment. The plan was to cross the continent ""unassisted and unsupported"" - with no supply drops or help from dogs or any other source. The first solo and unsupported crossing of the continent was achieved by Norwegian Borge Ousland in 1997. But Mr Worsley's record attempt differed as Mr Ousland used a kite to help drag his supply sled. British explorer Felicity Aston became the first woman to cross the Antarctic alone in January 2012 but she had supply drops. Profile: Henry Worsley Henry Worsley retired from the British army having attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in October 2015 after a 36-year career, serving with the Royal Green Jackets and later the Rifles. His military career saw him awarded an MBE for distinguished service on operations in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. Since childhood he had a passionate interest in the lives of the Antarctic explorers of the Edwardian era - Sir Ernest Shackleton, Captain Robert Scott and Roald Amundsen. In 2008, Mr Worsley led an expedition to commemorate the centenary of Shackleton's ""Nimrod"" journey, which pioneered a route through the Transantarctic Mountains to a point just 97 miles (156km) short of the South Pole. To commemorate the centenary of Scott's and Amundsen's expeditions, Mr Worsley returned to Antarctica in 2011, leading a team of six soldiers retracing the original 1912 journey to the South Pole. He led the Amundsen route - a 900-mile (1,448km) unsupported journey - and in doing so, became the only person to have completed the classic Antarctic routes of Shackleton, Scott and Amundsen. Source: Endeavour Fund Mr Worsley's latest expedition again followed in the footsteps of his idol Sir Ernest Shackleton, who set off to cross Antarctica in 1914. The ill-fated trip saw his ship Endurance became trapped in ice for 10 months before it sank, but not one of the expedition's members died. Mr Worsley was a distant relative of Frank Worsley, the captain of the Endurance. Sir Ernest Shackleton's granddaughter Alexandra said Mr Worsley's death would be a ""huge loss to the adventuring world"". ""The whole point of this one was that Henry was doing it on his own. I suppose you could say he was doing more and more adventurous and interesting things,"" she said. Mr Worsley had passed his target of raising Â£100,000, and the Endeavour Fund said in a statement that it was ""devastated"" by his death. In October, he told the BBC he expected to lose two stone (12.7kg) during the challenge. He said his journey should take 75 days and he would take enough food for 80 days. Asked if he was ""mad"" to take on the challenge, he said: ""What will drive me on is raising money for these wounded soldiers.""",Explorer Henry Worsley has died after developing a serious infection as he tried to cross Antarctica unaided.
"Julian Cole, a sports science student, was left brain damaged and paralysed as a result of an incident in Bedford in 2013. The case was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service last September. Mr Cole's mother Claudia said she will seek a review of the decision. LIVE: Follow updates and reaction She said: ""Their decision makes no sense to me or Julian's family."" Bedfordshire Police said a gross misconduct hearing would be held. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) previously said four of the officers face allegations relating to their ""honesty and integrity"". Now aged 23, Mr Cole was injured during an incident involving bouncers and police outside the former Elements nightclub on Mill Street in May 2013. The talented athlete and footballer broke his neck and suffered a severe injury to his spinal cord. He now needs 24-hour care and his mother Claudia spends hours by his bedside in a care home. 'Insufficient evidence' The case was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) by the IPCC. A CPS spokesperson said: ""CPS lawyers considered charges of misconduct in public office, perverting the course of justice and breaches of health and safety law. ""They have now concluded that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against any of the officers and no further action will be taken."" Bedfordshire Police said the gross misconduct hearing would be held in due course. One officer has retired and the others could be sacked if the disciplinary charges are proved. Temporary Dep Ch Con Mike Colbourne said: ""Our thoughts remain with Julian Cole's family and friends, who have had to wait almost four years for this decision. ""It is disappointing the investigation by the IPCC took such a long time to get to this point, which has put added strain on Mr Cole's family and the officers involved.""","Five police officers will not face criminal charges over the way they dealt with a man who broke his neck outside a nightclub, the BBC has been told."
"Investigations are continuing into the cause of the blaze at Peebles High School, which caters for about 1,200 pupils. Scottish Borders Council said art classrooms, a gymnasium and surrounding areas suffered ""significant damage"". It said it was working closely with the school's management team to organise learning plans for each year group. The council said that would include using other locations for classes as well as some online learning and that parents would be directly informed. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze at the Borders secondary after it broke out at about 13:00 on Thursday. 'Wouldn't be safe' Everyone was evacuated safely and no-one was injured in the incident, which saw nine fire engines and two height appliances working to bring the blaze under control. Council chief executive Tracey Logan said: ""This fire has resulted in some serious damage to the school and it just wouldn't be safe or practical to open it without taking time to properly assess the damage and plan the recovery. ""To minimise disruption we've taken a swift decision to close it right through to the Christmas break."" Ms Logan said there would be a particular focus on helping pupils who were preparing to sit prelim exams. Scottish Fire and Rescue Service Area Commander Steve Gourlay said it was a ""large, complex"" fire that had required resources from across the east of Scotland and further afield. He said a fire investigation team would look into the cause and Police Scotland also said inquiries into the incident were ongoing. Ms Logan said it was ""not appropriate"" to speculate on the cause of the fire. The council has also set up a dedicated webpage for updates. The old gym, which was among the areas most affected by the fire, was due to be used as a polling station on 12 December. However, voters will now go to Priorsford Primary, which will now be closed to pupils on the day.",A high school in the Borders will remain closed until at least Christmas following a severe fire.
"The pro-European March for Change is holding a ""No to Boris, Yes to Europe"" event, and includes a blimp depicting him. Campaigners are asking for Mr Johnson to ""stop the Brexit chaos"". Either he or Jeremy Hunt will be named as Theresa May's replacement as prime minister next week. Former foreign secretary Mr Johnson, who has declined to comment on the march, is seen as the frontrunner in the contest. He said the UK would leave the European Union by 31 October ""come what may"" under his tenure, while Mr Hunt said he expected this to happen by Christmas. Mr Johnson has claimed Brexit ""done right"" could ""cement and intensify"" the union between the UK nations. The balloon depicting Mr Johnson has ""Â£350m"" emblazed on its front, symbolising the leave campaign's pledge of money towards the NHS during the 2016 referendum. The March for Change organisers said: ""We won't put up with a hard Brexit PM being imposed on the country and hurtling us towards the cliff edge.""",Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets of central London in a march against Brexit and Conservative Party leadership hopeful Boris Johnson.
"By Tom Airey & Mark AnsellBBC News As the clock approached midnight on 8 November 2019, Justin Smith woke up to the sound of frantic banging on his front door, and the voice of a neighbour yelling ""You've got to get out mate, it's coming"". His home in Fishlake was one of the properties ruined by dirty flood water, waist-deep in places. The village, near Doncaster, saw approximately 160 homes and businesses flooded, with repair work stalling in many households because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Smith's home being flooded capped an ""awful"" period of his life, with 2019 also seeing him separate from his wife of 18 years and his marketing director role being made redundant. ""My last working day, ironically, was the day my house flooded, then for the rest of the winter I was staying with family,"" he said. After waking up, he rushed around the house throwing some belongings in a bag, rescuing his two springer spaniels and moving his TV upstairs as water poured in through his cloakroom cupboard. ""I ended up going down to the local pub, the landlady gave me a quilt and I slept in the corner of the pub for the night with the dogs,"" he said. ""The next morning I was leaving the village on the back of a tractor, it was a bizarre time."" Fishlake became a familiar name to millions across the nation, with TV crews ferried in and out of the village by local farmers in trailers. Alongside the cameras came some high-profile visitors, with the Prime Minister given a frosty reception in nearby Stainforth almost a week after the flooding. As British Army personnel put down sandbags to shore up the village's bridge, Boris Johnson was met with shouts of ""Where have you been?"" and ""You took your time"". ""I ended up stood in my flooded house talking to Prince Charles, which was one of the most bizarre moments of my life,"" Mr Smith said. ""I'd never had thought I'd meet him, let alone in my living room."" Dan Greenslade, another Fishlake resident, found his elation at becoming a father on the Friday morning abruptly halted by an urgent phone call to the hospital. ""It was about one in the morning on Saturday, the midwife came into the room and I was sat beside my partner on one of those little chairs you're given next to the bed,"" Mr Greenslade said. ""She said my sister was on the phone and the house was flooding."" As lockdown in March delayed repairs on their drying house, it was seven months before Mr Greenslade and partner Jade Croft could bring daughter Indie back to the family home for the first time. ""Everyone's going to get a bit nervous at this time of year now, every time I drive over the river I find myself checking how high it is, then looking at the forecast to see how much rain is due,"" he said. Further upstream from Fishlake, people in the Doncaster suburb of Bentley had seen it all before. Flooding in 2007 left some unable to afford growing flood insurance costs, with a report released on Thursday finding 25 homes in the town did not have appropriate cover included in their 2019 policy. Lorna Ulyett's home was covered but ongoing disagreements with her insurer have meant she and her partner are still living in a caravan in their back garden. ""The novelty wears off very quickly, you don't realise how much you're going to miss the simple things like frying an egg, the basic day-to-day stuff gets very difficult and tedious,"" she said. ""All our kids have asked for for Christmas is for us to sit in the kitchen and eat a Christmas dinner that I've cooked for them, that's all they want."" Rotherham, along with Sheffield, saw the early brunt of the rainfall, with businesses in the Parkgate area suffering huge damage. The Homeflair furniture retailer had 300 sofas ruined, with the company lacking in flood insurance after it was flooded 13 years ago. Homeflair director Hanif Khan said: ""It's been very hard, especially when you lose so much stock, you have to replenish the stock and need the finances to do it. ""If any insurance company wants to operate within the UK they should be made to offer the people in the flood zones flood cover."" Mr Khan said his business spent ""hundreds of thousands of pounds"" on repair costs and lost further money in a recent ram-raid on the shop. But sales of sofas and outdoor furniture during lockdown saved the company he founded in 1981. ""I think if it gets flooded again we'd be gone, we'd be history,"" he said. In July, the government unveiled a Â£5.2bn plan to tackle the risks of flooding and coastal erosion, aiming to ensure 336,000 properties in England were ""better protected"" by 2027. The Environment Agency has been in the process of completing a Â£12m programme of defences across South Yorkshire, with 100 separate projects including reinforcing river banks and upgrading pumping stations. Helen Batt, the county's flood risk manager, said: ""Sadly we can't guarantee that South Yorkshire won't flood again, The climate's changing, we're getting more intense rainfall, higher sea level rises so unfortunately it's more likely that we'll flood more frequently in the future. ""We have carried out a lot of work in the last year, the defences are in a better condition and also we're working with partners to look at what more we can do to better protect communities going forward."" Back in Fishlake, Mr Smith and other villagers have been finishing a book about their experiences, aimed at being a historical document and a thank you to the hundreds of volunteers across the region who assisted during their time of need. ""I'm hoping 2021 will be a great year,"" he said. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

"The proposals look at centralising services at either of the two hospitals in Shrewsbury or Telford. Future Fit was launched in 2013 to overhaul services at Shropshire's Royal Shrewsbury and Princess Royal hospitals. A 14-week consultation began on Wednesday, with public exhibitions taking place across the county. Residents can also give input online. Last year, local health bosses agreed a preferred option that would see emergency care and women and children's services located in Shrewsbury. Telford's Princess Royal site, meanwhile, would become the centre for planned care, like elective surgery, orthopaedics and specialist bariatric and breast services, yet its emergency department downgraded to an urgent care centre. But the issue of emergency care has been divisive in Telford, with the public and Telford & Wrekin Council, fighting plans to 'downgrade' its A&E unit Council leader Shaun Davies said: ""We believe our preferred option, of having emergency care in Telford and planned care in Shrewsbury is better for everyone."" Shrewsbury and Telford Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs both sites, has argued centralising services including emergency care would make it easier to recruit staff, improve facilities and improve care quality. Chief executive, Simon Wright, said: ""It has been a long journey to get to this point but we're really pleased. ""I think our doctors and nurses are keen to take the messages out to the population and share what it will really mean for them.""",People will be able to have their say on plans for a multi-million reorganisation of hospital services.
"The division is owned by the National Australia Bank (NAB). The bank says the improvement follows the transfer of Â£5.6bn of commercial real estate assets to NAB last October. Last year, the Australian-based group announced a strategic review of its UK business which led to hundreds of job losses. David Thorburn, chief executive of the UK bank, told BBC Scotland that good progress had been made. He added: ""Last year we talked about this as a three-year programme but we're well ahead of where we expected to be and most of the reshaping work will be behind us by the autumn"". He said the transfer of real estate business had helped cut bad debts by Â£91m. There has been continued speculation that NAB may sell off its UK business, but Mr Thorburn said he would not ""fuel the fires"" by commenting on the reports. He said: ""I'm spending 100% of my time on the implementation of the strategic review which is all about transforming the business and getting it in better shape."" Mortgage lending in the period to the end of March increased by more than 9%, well above the UK average of 1.5%. However, lending to small and medium-sized businesses (SME) fell. The bank is investing significant sums in refreshing its brands and in technology. Mr Thorburn said the bank wanted to target younger customers. He said: ""What they are saying to us is that they want different ways of interacting - they want mobile banking in particular, which is something we will be launching in the summer. ""They want to use contactless cards and are much less likely to visit a branch so we're trying to respond to that with the investments we're making.""","The Clydesdale and Yorkshire banking division has made a half-year pre-tax profit of Â£54m, compared with a loss of Â£38m in the same period last year."
"He said the UK government would not want criticism from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland before the talks. Mr Jones is on a three-day visit to Norway to learn about its EU links. In December, Prime Minister Theresa May pledged to set out her Brexit proposals in a speech in the new year. She has said the UK will begin the formal Brexit negotiation process by the end of March. On Wednesday, Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales: ""We want to be in a position where we have agreed a line with the whole of the UK, before they [the UK government] go into negotiations. ""The last thing they will want is for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to be publicly critical of them as they enter those negotiations. ""Now that's not what I want to do, let's get that clear, that's not my starting point, but they will want to avoid that."" UK ministers would want a ""reasonably united front in order to go into those negotiations with what I would want to see, which is our support"", Mr Jones said. ""So far we don't know what their position is, we have no idea what they're thinking, and that needs to be made clear pretty soon, for everybody's sake,"" he added. Before setting off for Oslo, Mr Jones repeated his call for Wales to maintain ""full and unfettered access"" to the European single market. Although not an EU member, Norway pays for full access to the European single market, accepts most EU laws and allows EU citizens to live and work there. Norway is exempt from EU rules on agriculture, fisheries, justice and home affairs but has no say over how the rules of the single market are created. He said ""the Norwegian model is not ideal"" but the trip gave him opportunity ""to look at what's best for Wales and Britain"". In November, the first minister told AMs that maintaining access to Europe's single market without extra costs was a more important issue than immigration. On Wednesday, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies accused Mr Jones of seeking to ""have his cake and eat it"" by demanding full single market access while accepting the need for immigration controls.","UK ministers must make clear what Brexit deal they want ""pretty soon"" to ensure a ""reasonably united front"" with devolved nations for the negotiations, First Minister Carwyn Jones has warned."
"Footage of Amos Price setting his dog on eight-year-old Cleo on 23 October was shared widely online after it was released in a bid to identify him. The 30-year-old, from Pelsall, West Midlands, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Price, described by police as ""a yob"", was also banned from keeping animals for life at Walsall Magistrates' Court. The crime was discovered when Cleo's owner, Gary Truefitt, checked his home's CCTV footage after he became suspicious that his pet had not come back inside. It showed Price opening the garden gate and releasing his dog, which savaged Cleo outside her home in Woodlands Crescent, Pelsall. In a statement, Mr Truefitt said: ""I feel as if there is a big part of my life missing. ""I don't want to go home because I know Cleo is not there."" He previously described Cleo as ""a daft cat in lots of ways"" but a companion who ""will be very much missed"". West Midlands Police said the attack was ""completely mindless, senseless and beyond any justification"". ""As a police force and community we have all been appalled by the sickening actions of Price."" The unemployed father of two, who has recent convictions for criminal damage and assault, claimed he was drunk at the time. His defence said he was ""extremely ashamed and sorry"" and that his family had received death threats after the footage was shared on social media.

"Connolly James Cummins was appearing in court at Downpatrick on Friday. He was released even though his file was marked ""hold"" as he still faced charges including theft and aggravated vehicle-taking. Mr Ford revealed details of the case while addressing MLAs about the accidental release of a prisoner accused of rape. Police are still looking for Devidas Paliutis, 27, who appeared at Newry Magistrates Court via a video link from Maghaberry Prison on Wednesday. Remains at large The Prison Service was told by the court that the holding charges had been withdrawn but did not realise he had been returned for trial to the Crown Court on other charges. Mr Ford said this latest error would be included in the scope of the inquiry into how Mr Paliutis came to be released. Outlining details of the case in the Assembly, he said a judge at Downpatrick Crown Court had dismissed charges against Mr Cummins of breaching a custody probation order. ""It is my understanding however that Mr Cummins' file was marked 'hold' on the basis that he is still awaiting trial on other charges, namely theft, aggravated vehicle-taking and using a vehicle without insurance. ""It appears that a prison custody officer failed to take these charges into account and released Mr Cummins in error."" Mr Ford said he remains at large even though the mistake was discovered within minutes. Ulster Unionist leader Tom Elliott told Mr Ford: ""Would the minister accept that in other places senior civil servants and indeed ministers have had to resign for much less?"" Mr Ford said it was ""clearly a serious situation"" but the car theft offences were much less serious. He said he would wait for the results of the inquiry before deciding if there were ""appropriate actions to take against individuals"". Justice Committee Chairman Lord Morrow suggested the errors demonstrated a lax prison regime. The minister said these were isolated incidents out of about 6,000 cases over the past five or six years. He said the inquiry would be completed by the end of October, and its findings would be reviewed by the chief inspector of criminal justice in Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire. ""I have today been assured by the director general of the Prison Service that measures are in place to strengthen procedures at all prisons,"" he said. ""These include a strengthening of staff capability in this area and improved communications from the video link facilities to the office that authorises discharge.""","A second prisoner was mistakenly released from a court last week, Justice Minister David Ford has said."
"By Justin ParkinsonPolitical reporter, BBC News The Highways Agency says the new restriction would apply from 7am to 7pm, seven days a week. It would be in place from junction 28, near Matlock, Derbyshire, to junction 35a, north of Rotherham. Variable speed limits are widely used to aid traffic flow, but the RAC said this could be the first time they had been implemented to cut air pollution. It warned that reducing the maximum speed from the national standard 70mph to 60mph could ""pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway"" and there would ""inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility"". 'Cleaner vehicles' The Highways Agency said the lower limit, which has been put out to consultation, was likely to remain for ""several years"". In its document, it stated that the current use of the 70mph speed limit for motorways was having ""adverse impacts on air quality"" and that cutting it would reduce emissions. It also said the change would bring ""reduced congestion, increased capacity and improved journey time reliability for users of the motorway"". The normal speed limit would still apply to the rest of the M1, which runs from north London to Leeds. Tougher European Union guidelines on air quality have come into force and the agency argued that a lower limit would be needed to ensure these were met on the section from junctions 28 and 35a, which goes past Mansfield, Chesterfield and Sheffield. It said: ""For the purposes of this consultation, it should be assumed that the speed limit will need to be in place for several years. However, we are not able to give an indication in this document of how many years the speed limit will need to be retained."" But the document said: ""It is expected that vehicle emissions will reduce as more new, cleaner vehicles come into use and older, more polluting vehicles become obsolete."" The agency said it could change its plans, by limiting the operation of the lower speed limits to peak hours, or Mondays to Fridays. The length of the stretch of road affected could be shortened too, it added. RAC technical director David Bizley said: ""This is a landmark proposal as to the best of our knowledge motorway speed limits have not previously been lowered in order to comply with environmental legislation."" He added that it ""would certainly negate some of the current benefits of operating this section as a 'smart' motorway where motorists are allowed to use the hard shoulder to reduce congestion"". Mr Bizley also said: ""More worryingly, it could pave the way for similar restrictions on other sections of motorway. While preserving air quality is obviously a paramount concern there will inevitably be a negative impact on business efficiency and individual mobility. ""This very powerfully demonstrates the impact that speed has on emissions and many will be surprised to hear that a reduction of just 10mph can have such a significant effect on improving air quality."" The consultation will close on 3 March.","The government is proposing to set up a 60mph speed limit for a 32-mile stretch of the M1, in a bid to cut pollution."
"Scottish Development International (SDI) said it had also managed to secure 5,500 jobs despite the global recession. As well as attracting investment, the agency said it had helped 900 Scottish companies to internationalise. SDI is controlled by the Scottish government, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE). Anne MacColl, interim chief executive of SDI, said: ""As a nation, Scotland has always punched above its weight in attracting inward investment, although winning this type of investment has become more challenging as global markets suffered during the recession. ""Despite this, we have hit our targets and are encouraged by the range of new investment projects we've helped to secure during the last year, such as those by Skykon, Glaxo SmithKline, Ryanair, Tesco Personal Finance and Stena. ""This type of investment has secured over 5,500 planned jobs for Scotland and shows that Scotland remains attractive to investors across a wide range of sectors.""

Scottish companies will generate a projected Â£220m in sales from participation in exhibitions, trade missions and learning journeys facilitated by SDI. Enterprise Minister Jim Mather said the results underlined the significance of the body's work in promoting Scotland on the international stage. He said: ""Securing continued inward investment at a time of global economic uncertainty is a commendable achievement, and the challenge now with a fragile recovery under way is to sustain this level of performance and steer Scotland towards long-term economic success.""",The Scottish government's exports agency has said it generated more than Â£500m to Scotland's economy last year.
"The 400m-long (1,300ft) Ever Given was wedged across the canal in Egypt before salvage crews dislodged her on Monday. It took a mammoth salvage operation using tug boats to refloat the ship. Ever Given is expected to continue on its voyage and call at Rotterdam before Felixstowe, a company that pilots ships into British ports said. The Port of Felixstowe said operationally its arrival would be treated as ""just another ship"" and it was not planning any special preparations. Suez is one of the world's busiest trade routes, and companies were forced to reroute ships, causing long tailbacks of hundreds of vessels. Peter Berdowski, chief executive of Dutch salvage company Boskalis, said the Ever Given had been refloated on Monday afternoon, ""thereby making free passage through the Suez Canal possible again"". Harwich Haven Authority (HHA), which pilots ships into ports including Felixstowe, said the Ever Given would need to be checked for damage in Egypt to see if it was fit to go to sea. The HHA's chief executive Neil Glendinning said: ""If that is the case and there is no structural damage then she will continue on her voyage. ""So we will see her, just a little late."" He said it would be a week to 10 days from when the ship was allowed to go back to sea until it would arrive at Felixstowe. The Port of Felixstowe said it did not have an estimated time of arrival. The 200,000-tonne ship ran aground on 23 March amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Containers on board are carrying a huge variety of items and the insured value of the cargo is believed to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars. Steve Parks, director at Seaport Freight Services, a shipping and freight-forwarding company based at the Port of Felixstowe, has 20 containers of goods on the Ever Given, containing a ""variety of things"", including food items. He said it was ""super news"" that it had been refloated. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

"The annual event started out in 2007 as a Christmas Market in Hyde Park and has since grown in size with ice skating, shows and roller coaster rides added.

A statement issued on the Winter Wonderland website said the announcement came ""with a heavy heart"". It added: ""In light of ongoing health concerns, travel restrictions and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, and considering the size and scale of this event, we just couldn't find a way to do that without compromising the magical attractions, shows, rides, bars and experiences that make Hyde Park Winter Wonderland so special.

"The anti-terrorism and border security bill is designed to combat ""hostile state"" activity and the terror threat. It aims to close loopholes in current legislation surrounding technological and cyber activity. But a committee scrutinising it fears it could criminalise innocent internet users and breach EU human rights law. Labour MP Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee, said: ""This bill still crosses the line on human rights."" But others have argued tougher measures are needed. Conservative peer Lord Tebbit, speaking in the Lords, at the second reading of the bill, said: ""The nature of the threat today is different, and it is made worse by the rise of so-called social media, which provides an open platform for the proponents of terrorism."" The bill includes a wide range of anti-terrorism measures, The committee said Parliament needs to consider ""deletion or amendment of clauses that would make it an offence to view or otherwise access terrorist material online"". Clause 3 of the bill would criminalise people who accessed terrorist material just once, meaning the curious could be snared by it, the joint committee on human rights said. In its report, the committee said the clause ""may capture academic and journalistic research as well as those with inquisitive or even foolish minds"". Security Minister Ben Wallace said: ""After the spate of terrorist attacks of last year and the deadly nerve agent attack in Salisbury, our intelligence services and police made the case for an update of existing legislation."" The government has yet to formally respond to the committee's report. Policing online activity has been on the government agenda for some years, with former Home Secretary Amber Rudd threatening in 2017 to tighten laws so people who repeatedly view terrorist material could be jailed for up to 15 years.","Inquisitive or ""foolish"" internet users could end up being jailed under planned new terror laws, a Parliamentary committee has warned."
"Mark Drakeford said a bill to convert EU laws into British laws was ""taking away responsibilities that have been devolved since 1999"". It follows Welsh Government accusations of a ""power grab"". On Friday, UK ministers said they wanted to temporarily retain powers in 24 areas, including animal health and food labelling. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement programme: ""[The UK government is] not willing to do things on the basis of agreement. ""It has picked a quarrel where no quarrel need exist because we have always said we understand the reason for a withdrawal bill - orderly transfer of EU law into domestic law - we're very comfortable that should be done. ""But it cannot be done by the UK government arbitrarily taking away responsibilities that have been devolved since 1999, for a length of time that they can't describe, on conditions that they won't share with us, for a purpose that we are not yet able to share. ""It cannot be one administration deciding and telling the rest."" On Friday, UK cabinet office minister David Lidington said the list of laws the UK government wanted to temporarily retain had been published in order to be open and transparent. He said: ""The list we have published today shows how many EU powers that were controlled by Brussels, will, after Brexit, be controlled by the parliaments and assemblies in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast. ""The vast majority of these new powers will be in the control of the devolved administrations on the day we leave the EU.""","The vote to leave the EU was ""not a vote to roll back devolution"", the finance secretary has said."
"By Lisa Summers & Laura PettigrewBBC Scotland For 12 days the city played host to a sporting and cultural spectacle. The Games, with a price tag of more than Â£500m, were hailed as the ""best ever"" but what made them so memorable and what legacy have they left in their wake? First and foremost new sporting heroes were born. ""It's all still a bit of a whirlwind,"" says gold medal-winning swimmer Ross Murdoch. Who could forget the look of stunned elation on the 20-year-old's face as he realised he had beaten Glasgow 2014 poster boy Michael Jamieson to claim gold in the 200m breaststroke? ""That infamous photo of me with my eyes wide open, well it's all still like that,"" he says. ""I still can't actually believe what happened in the summer."" And that's a view shared by others. His victory was one of many for Scotland - the team finished 4th in the medal's table. The memorable sporting moments are too many to list - be it Hannah Miley's triumph in the pool, Eilidh Child and Lynsey Sharp's silver medal wins on the track, Libby Clegg's gold in the 100m, Scotland's dominance in the judo and bowls and of course ""mailman"" Charlie Flynn's post-fight patter after his boxing win. At the velodrome, it was double gold for Neil Fachie and Craig MacLean in the para-cycling and back in the pool 13-year-old Erraid Davies from Shetland captured the nation's heart by claiming bronze in the para-sport 100m breaststroke. But, away from the sporting side of things the city was also achieving hero-like status. ""I keep meeting people, even today, and everyone just says how amazing the city was during the games,"" says silver medallist Lynsey Sharp. ""Everyone is just so proud of the show that Glasgow put on."" And no-one more so that the man responsible for making it happen, former head of Glasgow 2014, David Grevemberg. Back at the velodrome, reflecting on the success of the games, he describes a defining moment for him during the summer. ""As I was walking into Glasgow Green one of our Clydesider volunteers stopped me,"" he says. ""I believe she was 70-plus, and she said 'Glasgow will never be the same'. ""I said: 'Well m'am, why do you feel that?' and she said: 'Stop for a second and just look around'. So I stopped and I looked around and she said: 'Do you see it?' ""I saw it. Smiles. We had created enormous joy, enormous confidence and enormous pride all at the same time."" Magic wand But in the east end of the city - where residents faced years of disruption and upheaval as new venues were built - now that the Games bandwagon has packed up and rolled out of town, is that sense of joy and pride wearing thin? And what about that much hailed ""legacy""? ""This community has been squeezed for the past seven years and there was a wee feeling that they had been forgotten about,"" admits local Labour councillor Yvonne Kucuk. But, she is very hopeful for the future. ""The legacy has arrived,"" she proclaims on a walk around the site of a new Â£5m community hub in Dalmarnock. It is being constructed opposite the former athletes' village, which itself is being converted into family homes with the first residents due to move in at the end of January. ""Seven years ago when we won the chance to host the games, we asked local people 'If you had a magic wand, what would the local legacy be?' ""Top of the list was a brand new replacement for the community facility in Dalmarnock, which was torn down to make way for the games' transport hub."" Ms Kucuk, alongside other residents and development agency Clyde Gateway, has had to fight to make that a reality. And from the outset they were determined to ensure any new centre was designed, created and run by locals. ""That building, every brick, every blade of grass, every stone is owned and will be managed by this community,"" says Ms Kucuk proudly. GAMES LEGACY: THE FIGURES However, others remain unconvinced when it comes to positive impact the games have had on the people of the east end. ""This is one of the areas with the highest density of poverty and unemployment in the UK,"" says Neil Gray from Glasgow University. Confidence boost He set up the Glasgow Games Monitor to track the benefits of the Â£500m spent on bringing the games to the city. ""I think in the long-term what you have seen in the east end is decades of disinvestment in the Clyde,"" he said. ""So, a lot of people have been subject to huge amounts of poverty, disenfranchisement, exclusion from some of the benefits that have accrued to people in the city centre. ""What's happened with the redevelopment and investment is that it has tended to go towards office and business development and private housing in general. So a lot of the people who live in that area just can't access those types of facilities."" And he is not convinced by the sporting legacy either. ""In terms of the sporting infrastructure, most people that live in that area can't actually afford to go and use the National Indoor Sports Arena in the east end."" However, for the some of the new sporting heroes of the games, the events of summer 2014 truly were life changing. ""It has really boosted my confidence and it's made me more determined every day in training,"" says Dan Wallace who famously shouted ""For Freedom"" after winning gold in the pool. ""It's just great motivation - the feeling you get when you have done well and you have succeeded. That's what keeps me going every day."" And back in the east end, success and achievement is also keeping Yvonne Kucuk motivated. With the new community hub due to open in the spring, she talks of ""hopes and aspirations"" - of the children in the nursery, the apprentices working on the construction and the young people who will use the training facilities it will provide. ""It will change lives, not just for this generation but for generations to come,"" she says. ""There is probably not one person in Dalmarnock who does not know someone who has benefited from the games, and we have to build on that going forward.""","In July, amid a flurry of pipers, tartan, Scottie dogs and giant dancing teacakes the Commonwealth Games landed in Glasgow."
"The restrictions on drones, which are remotely-controlled, unmanned aircraft, will apply between 09:00 BST on Thursday and 22:30 on Sunday. The ban also extends between London and Windsor, where Mr Obama will have lunch with the Queen on Friday. Authorities said it was a routine ban, similar to those used at sports events. It comes after a London-bound flight is believed to have hit a drone on Sunday. Detectives launched an investigation after the pilot of the British Airways flight approaching Heathrow reported his aircraft being hit by a drone. Police say the drone was being flown near the area of Richmond Park in south-west London. Are drones dangerous or harmless fun? The rules for flying domestic drones Announcing the restrictions, the UK's National Air Traffic Service said they were part of an ""overarching security plan"" for the visit of Mr Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. Drones will be banned from flying over a large part of the capital, extending from Purley in the south to Haringey in the north. Restrictions are in place between Windsor and London on Friday - when the Obamas will have lunch at Windsor Castle. The ban also extends between Stansted Airport and the capital on Thursday night and Sunday morning. The Civil Aviation Authority says drones can usually be flown up to 400ft (122m). However, the regulations ban aircraft from flying below 762m (2,500ft), unless they are using Heathrow, Stansted or London City airports. Aircraft at London Heliport, RAF Northolt, and those being operated by the emergency services are to be excluded. The restrictions also apply to ""any small balloon, any kite weighing not more than two kilograms, any small unmanned aircraft and any parachute"" in the relevant areas. Super Bowl ban Similar rules have previously been introduced for high-profile visits and major sporting fixtures, including the London Olympics in 2012 and the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. Drones were recently banned at American Football's Super Bowl. The Obamas' visit to the UK stay is part of a tour including Saudi Arabia and Germany. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry will host the couple on Friday, Kensington Palace has said. The president will also stage a press conference with Prime Minister David Cameron.","Drones will be banned from flying in large parts of London during the visit of US President Barack Obama, aviation officials have announced."
"Runnymede Council wants the centre on the site, near Staines, to be legacy of celebrations in 2015 to mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. It is hoped 50% of the cash will come from the lottery and 50% from sponsors. A feasibility study has been completed and the project was now taking shape, the council said. Chief executive Paul Turrell said: ""This is an extremely complex project which will, I hope, enable generations to come to understand and appreciate the huge influence that the sealing of the Magna Carta has had, not just on British human rights but those of countless other nations across the world."" He said the Magna Carta established the rule of law and human rights and challenged the divine right of kings for the first time. Open-air performances The project would include an education campaign about the Magna Carta, improvements to the site at Runnymede Pleasure Grounds, and a visitor centre built around the existing cafe area as the most viable option. The centre would be a building surrounded by shallow water, including an exhibition space, cafe, office and classroom area, and an amphitheatre for open-air performances. The council said lottery bids were made in two stages and this was a ""first-round bid"". In the first round, cash can be allocated to help fund architectural work and planning assessments and, if successful, a second application is then made for the final design work and construction.",A bid for lottery cash is being submitted to help build an Â£8m visitor centre on the site of the sealing of the Magna Carta in Surrey.
"A Holyrood committee inquiry has concluded that there were ""serious flaws"" in the government's approach. The confidence vote was tabled by Tory MSP Ruth Davidson, who said nobody had taken responsibility for the failures. But MSPs voted by 65 to 31 to reject the motion, with the Greens backing the SNP and Labour and Lib Dems abstaining. Ms Sturgeon said she ""may not have got everything right"" in her handling of the matter, but insisted that she ""acted appropriately and made the right judgements overall"". And she told opposition parties that if they wanted to remove her they should do it in the forthcoming election on 6 May, adding: ""It is now time for the country to decide."" The Holyrood inquiry - which was set up in 2019 after the government conceded its handling of complaints against Mr Salmond had been unlawful - published its report earlier on Tuesday, stating that women had been badly let down by the failed process. A majority of members said Ms Sturgeon had misled the inquiry in her evidence, and said they found it hard to believe that she was not aware of concerns about Mr Salmond's alleged behaviour before November 2017. However an independent investigation by Irish lawyer James Hamilton concluded on Monday that Ms Sturgeon had not breached the ministerial code. He said Ms Sturgeon had given an ""incomplete narrative of events"" to MSPs, but that he believed this was a ""genuine failure of recollection"" and not deliberate. The Scottish Conservatives had tabled a motion of no confidence in Ms Sturgeon before either report had been published - saying that ""overwhelming"" evidence of wrongdoing had already emerged. Ms Davidson, the party's leader at Holyrood, told MSPs that ""nobody has taken responsibility for the multiple failings at every level which occurred"". She said that Ms Sturgeon ""should not feel able to continue in post"", and that ""the honourable thing would be to resign"". Ms Davidson said: ""The committee found that Nicola Sturgeon misled this parliament. Nothing can erase that fact, however inconvenient it is to the first minister and her supporters."" The best time for the opposition to call a no confidence vote is when they have enough support to win and can force a minister from office. That has never been a realistic prospect for the Conservatives in their efforts to oust Nicola Sturgeon. When they first announced plans for a vote the day before the first minister gave evidence to the Holyrood committee, it was clear she could see off their challenge with support from the Greens. When she was cleared of breaking the ministerial code by the Hamilton inquiry, her position strengthened. By pressing on regardless, the Tories managed to divide the opposition - with Labour and the Liberal Democrats refusing to vote with them and abstaining instead. The Tories say that makes them the only party strong enough to take on the SNP. But in enabling Nicola Sturgeon to comfortably win a confidence vote today they've given her a pre-election boost after some of her toughest weeks in office. Ms Sturgeon said she ""may not have got everything right in my handling of this situation"", but said she would ""reject entirely any suggestion of misleading this parliament"". And she said she would have resigned if Mr Hamilton had found she breached the code. However she said she had been ""cleared of any breach of the ministerial code"", and told Ms Davidson: ""If you think you can bully me out of office you are mistaken and have misjudged me. ""If you want to remove me from office as first minister, do it in an election"". Ms Sturgeon said she had been accused of ""conspiracy against, collusion with and cover-up on behalf of Alex Salmond"", but that ""none of that is supported by evidence because none of that is true."" The first minister was backed by Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie, who said the inquiry had become a ""farce"" and accused opposition members of the committee of ""destroying the credibility of their own work"". Both Labour and the Lib Dems abstained in the final vote, meaning only the Conservatives backed the motion. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said there had been a ""litany of failures"" by the government, but said the Tories were ""only interested in getting a scalp"" and ""grubby party politics"". He said: ""This is a day of shame for our parliament. Scotland deserves a better government and a better opposition."" Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said ""nobody wins from this ugly debate"", and that the confidence debate and motion ""cannot be the end"" of the matter.",Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has survived a vote of no confidence at Holyrood over her government's handling of complaints against Alex Salmond.
"The body of Josh Clayton, 23, from Taunton, Somerset, was found on rocks near Tresco in September 2015 - 10 days after he went missing. His family always believed his death was not an accident. Devon and Cornwall Police was ordered to carry out a fresh investigation but has found no evidence of foul play. Mr Clayton had been working as a bar manager on Tresco when he went missing on 13 September 2015. His body was discovered by a French yachtsman. At his inquest last year the coroner halted proceedings after a witness said he saw Mr Clayton arguing with a group of men on the night he disappeared, prompting a new investigation. 'Missed opportunities' Mr Clayton's mother, Tracey, said she had little faith the police's latest conclusions. She said: ""I feel, because there were so many missed opportunities in the first investigation, although they said they started with a blank sheet, I don't think they did. ""I feel they did try but their starting point was misleading anyway because all of the first investigation statements were on the understanding that Josh was a drugged-up drunk who had just fallen in the sea and that's all they wanted to believe."" Concluding the latest review, Det Supt Steve Parker said: ""There's no evidence of third party involvement and no evidence of criminal activity in the death of Mr Clayton identified by us. ""Obviously the cause of death is a matter for the coroner and the coroner's court.""",Police have ruled out murder in the case of a man who died after a party on the Isles of Scilly more than two years ago.
"By Fiona MurrayBBC News NI When the violence of the Troubles erupted in Northern Ireland, it was press photographers like Paul Faith who were there to capture it. He and many others were effectively thrust into the role of war photographers - except the bloodshed was not half a world away, but on the streets of their own towns. These people witnessed some of the worst atrocities of the conflict. Now, seven of them have shared their experiences in a film to be broadcast on Monday night. Shooting the Darkness - which features personal testimony, archive footage and still images - reflects on how many went from working on sport or farming news to portraying images of almost unimaginable pain and suffering. Initially, Paul Faith was an onlooker to the horror of the Troubles, a 30-year period of conflict which saw 3,500 people killed and many more injured. ""The daily work would be town hall receptions, dinners, unfurling of Orange banners, parades in the town, cheque presentations - and I was just bursting to get out to do news,"" he told the documentary. ""I would go home at night, turn on the news and there were bombs going off in Belfast, people being killed. It was just mayhem elsewhere. I just needed to get out, I felt as if it was just my calling."" On one of his first assignments, he recalls shaking ""from one end of the road for three miles to the other end"" as he covered a republican parade protesting against internment, a government policy to imprison people without trial. ""You could see the vengeance and the hatred. The soldiers were scared, the republicans were vicious to them and it was just a completely different world,"" he said. He talks about republicans being very ""media savvy"" at that time. An abiding memory was the 1998 funeral of IRA man Brendan Burns, when he captured the moment Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness stood beside the coffin, alongside masked men. ""It was bandit country. The Army and police were there in force with riot shields. We weren't sure what was going to happen, but we knew if something did happen it was going to be bad,"" he said. ""As the service was ending, the coffin was going to come out, the Chinooks [helicopters] were landing, six IRA guys appeared in full camouflage gear, fully masked, berets the whole lot. ""At the coffin, McGuinness was at the front on the right-hand side, no words were spoken."" He added: ""The Provos had played their ace; they got what they wanted in this picture of Martin McGuinness beside the IRA guys, carrying the coffin."" The spiral of violence March 1988 saw escalating violence culminating in some of the most infamous imagery to emerge from the Troubles. A fortnight of brutal violence began with the shooting dead of three IRA members in Gibraltar by the Army. Later that month, their funeral at Milltown Cemetery was attacked by loyalist Michael Stone. Three people were killed, dozens were wounded. Three days later, as one of Stone's victims was being buried, the mourners were said to be fearful of another attack. On the scene was photographer Martin Nangle - who captured some of the most memorable images of that day, images that would be beamed around the world. He was there working when two plain-clothed British soldiers drove into the path of the funeral. Corporals Derek Wood and David Howes were dragged out of a car and beaten. They were later stripped and shot dead by the IRA, their bodies dumped on waste ground. Martin was on hand to capture what happened - but feared the footage would be confiscated as cameramen had been threatened and told to stop filming. ""It became pretty evident that if I wanted to get this story out what was in the camera had to be taken out and new film put into the camera, wound on, reeled up - so that if I was asked for the film I would open the camera and rip it out and it would look like it was being destroyed,"" he said. ""It worked insofar as the story got out and the images got out."" Martin said he always looked out for a picture that would help describe the narrative of the Troubles. ""When I saw Belfast for the first time, I was quite shocked at the degree of decaying grandeur, so to speak, that was happening all over the city. This proud Victorian city [was] basically rotting around us,"" he said. But he knew he had to document the effect violence had on the people and the social fabric of Northern Ireland. A personal cost? ""It's probably better to view the world when you are in a situation like that from behind a camera,"" he said. ""Your mental process is going through composition, when to make that decision to press the shutter. ""Staying behind the camera is a safety valve to separate yourself from sinking into the event and becoming part of it, which is what you don't want to do. ""It's better just to treat it as a job, as an observer and not to get too close."" It's a view echoed by Paul Faith. ""Your only saving grace was you had a camera. You had something physically in front of you. In a way, it was probably like watching a TV screen."" But he added: ""You couldn't do this job without being touched."" Shooting The Darkness, by Broadstone Film, will be broadcast on BBC One Northern Ireland on Monday 23 November at 22:45 GMT.","""I really got my eyes opened - I was really, really scared."""
"By Hazel ShearingBBC News From cutting down on ""plant miles"" to reusing plastic pots, British gardeners, botanists and environmental campaigners have shared ways to keep your horticultural hobby sustainable. Houseplants are on the rise, according to the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), which says average sales in the second half of last year were up 60% on the previous year. The trend has been attributed to eco-friendly, health-conscious millennials who want to bring the great outdoors into their inner-city flats and nurture something ""real"" in an increasingly virtual world. About four in five 16 to 24-year-olds own at least one houseplant and a fifth of owners bought them to boost their health and wellbeing, a RHS survey suggests. If they can get some good photos along the way, even better. The hashtag #plantsofinstagram has been used more than 4 million times. Plant miles With the craze has sprung up a number of specialist online retailers that deliver straight to your door. Patch, which says it is London's biggest online plant retailer, is one example. It gives its plants nicknames like ""Chaz"" and ""Big Ken"" to endear them to prospective ""plant parents"". Chief executive Freddie Blackett says that part of the appeal is that plants make people feel ""calmer, happier and more at ease"". Patch's plants are grown in the Netherlands and shipped to the UK as and when they are ordered, which avoids excess plants being shipped. But ordering online could rack up ""plant miles"", says Fay Kenworthy, co-founder of PlantSwap, a Sheffield-based community initiative that encourages people to trade plants locally. ""As many plants are brought in from overseas, their transportation represents a significant ecological footprint,"" she says, noting that while most come from Holland, orchids can be shipped from Indonesia and ""light-loving"" plants from Kenya and Zimbabwe. ""You may have decided to reduce your international travel to protect the environment but your plants are still shipping across the world."" Shipping from abroad isn't too much of a concern for botanist and BBC presenter James Wong, the proud owner of 500 houseplants. ""You're going to be [ordering plants] on a much smaller scale compared to outdoors, so, by definition, it's going to have a lower carbon footprint,"" he says. He argues that home delivery has less of an environmental impact than multiple trips to the garden centre in a car, and that many UK buyers live closer to Amsterdam than British-based suppliers. He adds that growing certain plants in hotter climates and shipping them to the UK can eliminate the need for heated greenhouses closer to home. However, Wong agrees that exchanging unwanted plants, cuttings, and seedlings at plant swaps is a sustainable option for houseplant buyers. Another benefit, according to Ms Kenworthy, is that it avoids the excess packaging that comes with new plants - including plastic pots. Plastic pots Pots can be a ""nightmare"" to recycle, says anti-plastic campaigner Amy Meek, 16. Only about 10% of local authorities in the UK accept them, according to analysts at the Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). Sometimes they are not collected because they are considered contaminated. But many are also made from black plastic, which often cannot be detected by sorting machines at recycling centres, and so end up in landfill or incinerated. Many local authorities reject even non-black plastic pots, which has led to the development of more easily-recyclable taupe pots and even biodegradable pots. The Horticultural Trades Association and RHS Gardens offer plant pot recycling or ""take back"" schemes, and B&Q says it is trialling a recycling scheme. Miss Meek, who runs environmental charity Kids Against Plastic with her younger sister, Ella, wants buyers to think about plants' packaging. She encourages people to ask: ""Will I be able to I use it again, or is there somewhere else I could look to buy these plants from that are using more sustainable packaging or one that could be used for longer?"" For peat's sake But being a sustainable houseplant buyer is not just about keeping tabs on how a plant is delivered - it is also about what it is grown in. The main problem for botanist Dr Trevor Dines is the use of peat in composts. The earthy substance, found in waterlogged areas in the UK, is made of decomposed plant matter and can take thousands of years to form. ""Commercial extraction can remove over 500 years-worth of growth in a single year,"" says Dr Dines, of British conservation charity Plantlife. He encourages people to check with retailers about the use of peat, or to stick to plants that don't need it, like orchids or cacti. But hang on, don't houseplants clean the air? Because plants take in CO2 and emit oxygen, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that they offset any environmental damage by cleaning the air. PhD research carried out by Curtis Gubb, an environmental consultant, found that plants can remove ""significant amounts"" of CO2 in a room - but how much depends on the type of plant, how many there are, how light the room is and how much water is in the soil. ""The amount the plant is watered affects its ability to function and remove CO2, in the same way as with people - if you're dehydrated or have drunk too much water you will not function as well,"" he says. Dracaena ""Golden Coast"" plants and peace lillies performed best in his research, but he says you'd still need to buy a lot of them - even installing a vertical garden or ""green wall"" - and have extra lighting in order for them to reduce CO2 levels. So, are houseplants bad for the environment? Wong says that everything we do has a carbon footprint and that, in the scheme of things, people shouldn't ""freak out"" about their environmental impact. However, he advises that if buyers want to be as sustainable as possible, they should talk to their suppliers about the use of peat, avoid buying houseplants that are ""designed to die"" like Poinsettias and sprayed cacti, and propagate plants from cuttings and seeds to offset any environmental concerns. ""Not that those things are a huge issue,"" he says. ""But every little bit helps.""","Cultivating an indoor plant is thought to have positive effects on mental health and wellbeing, and a snap of a succulent is a sure way to get some Instagram likes. But just how green are your fingers?"
"The company said the find was made after drilling an extension to its Clulzean well, and could be the most promising of its kind in recent years. Maersk and its partners have agreed to a further appraisal to assess the full extent of the field. The results are expected in the summer of 2011. Maersk's oil and gas division moved in to the North Sea with its acquisition of Kerr McGee's assets in 2005. Since then it has expanded and now has an interest in 14 producing fields, seven of which it operates.","The petroleum arm of the Danish shipping company, Maersk, has struck gas in the North Sea, 145km east of Aberdeen."
"By Douglas FraserBusiness/economy editor, Scotland The businessman and professor has control over around 10,000 acres of land, much of it in the Southern Uplands where South Lanarkshire, Dumfriesshire and East Ayrshire meet. These comprise seven sites of special industrial ugliness, because that is where vast diggers and trucks tore away at hillsides to expose coal seams. When you visit them, the most striking thing is how fast this happened. They look like it should have taken centuries to have such an impact, yet most were worked in the past quarter century and for less than ten years each. The area has been worked for coal for eight centuries, some of it deep-mined. Removing topsoil and rock to get at these narrow seams of soil only became commercially viable when the machinery got to the right scale and robustness. I went with a TV camera crew to the Glenmuckloch opencast site near Sanquhar, being worked by coal company Hargreaves and on land owned by the Duke of Buccleuch. We watched in awe as each scoop from the digger picked up 15 tonnes. Four scoops goes into each truckload. They could take 100 tonnes each, but that would not be an efficient use of the vast engines. For every tonne of coal removed, around 22 tonnes of rock has to be extracted around the coal seam. For those who, child-like, wonder at the scale of these machines, the tyres give you some idea of the money involved. Each truck has six tyres, they cost Â£7,000 each, and because of wear and tear on rocks and gravel, they need to be replaced at least twice a year. Undercut by fracking For several other such sites, the money ran out. Fracking in North America undercut coal. US power stations were converted to cheap gas, so as demand for coal fell, the price plummeted. Scotland had been the biggest player in UK opencast mining. At the start of 2013, the two companies dominating Scottish opencast production - ATH and Scottish Resources Group - went bust. About 1,000 jobs went. The insolvency experts who took them over quickly found the firms were nowhere close to being adequately funded for the clean-up costs, to which they had committed. Filling in the giant holes and landscaping Scotland's opencast coalmines would take almost as much earth-moving as the original mining. The cost of that is estimated at Â£200m. But the liquidators had only Â£4m they could hand over, while councils had to go after the bonds (a form of insurance policy) which the companies had taken out. According to Prof Griggs, if all the bonds were paid out they would raise perhaps Â£30m to Â£40m. But as some are being contested by insurance companies, he anticipates between Â£20m and Â£25m will be available to him. The failure to fund the clean-up clearly reflects badly on the defunct firms, which had thought they could finance each restoration project with cash from the next site. It also reflects poorly on the local councils, which failed to nail down the financial assurances when they awarded the planning approval. Fife was also caught by this. We're assured lessons have been learned, and it won't happen again. But to salvage what it could, the Scottish government turned to Prof Griggs as its adviser on business regulation. It asked first if red tape was one reason things had gone so badly. His answer was that it was only a part of the explanation. But having got him interested, ministers then asked if Prof Griggs would lead the newly-created Scottish Mines Restoration Trust, and do what he could to sort out the mess. The Sanquhar resident began with that Â£4m budget, employing four people, to secure the sites, fence off ponds where swimmers sometimes unwisely go, and to monitor water quality. He turned to a wildlife charity, and gifted it some moorland and forest. He is, cautiously, considering options on selling parcels of land to local farmers. Pupil investment Griggs has been working with the Duke of Buccleuch, owner of Glenmuckloch, from which Â£100,000 of community funds are expected to come from two wind turbines being installed this summer. He said: ""I'm getting on in life and I decided that if we were looking 25 years into the future, with Â£100,000 a year to invest in the community, maybe we should ask the young people to do it. ""So the investment committee - the people who'll make the decisions where the money will go - will be the rolling fifth and sixth form of Sanquhar Academy."" In their first year of operation, the pupil committee has compiled a short list of applications for funding, focussing on facilities for the young and for older local residents. ""Having worked with these young people for the last year in putting this together, they've risen to the task amazingly,"" said Prof Griggs. ""My Trust is giving them a little pump priming at the beginning. ""We've given them Â£25,000 to start, because it's unlikely that the income from the wind turbines will start to come through until August or September this year."" Prof Griggs turned to the British Geological Survey to see if its members could make use of other sites. What they found astounded them. One told him - perhaps with a little exaggeration - that the Spireslack site in South Lanarkshire, excavated in only the four years to 2007, is the geologists' equivalent of the Large Hadron Collider. The diggers have exposed layer upon layer of geological pre-history, ripe for study instead in place of geology textbooks or computer generated 3D images. ""This is a geologists' playground,"" Prof Griggs told me ""When they come here, they go gooey-eyed. These are things you won't see anywhere else in the world."" Where seams of coal and sandstone have been forced up by volcanic activity, and then cleared away in the 21st century, the sheer 'pavement' under it is exposed at around 45 degrees, offering an enticing prospect for geologists and for climbers and abseilers. The last thing they would want to do with Â£200m, if it were available, would be to fill it this 1km long, 80-metre deep valley. The disturbed rocks offer abundant opportunities for fossil-hunters. Nearby, flattened terraces of disused coalfield is being considered for lease to chicken farmers. And while the area could become a public geo-park, turned over to both study and geology education, the leisure potential ranges from a very long zipwire, to mountain and quad biking, to redevelopment of the football pitch where the legendary Glenbuck Cherrypickers team played. Scotland and Liverpool legend Bill Shankly was born in Glenbuck village in 1913, and was one of dozens of locals who went into professional football. Although Glenbuck village has been flattened by the earthmovers, scores of fans still make the pilgrimage from Anfield to Shankly's birthplace each year. If the Restoration Trust's plans work out, the pilgrims could have the opportunity to stay in holiday cottages and play on a restored Glenbuck pitch. The local mining heritage could be explained in a museum. Griggs is looking for the entrepreneurs to make it happen. Healing scars Along the valley and a rock's throw from the M74 motorway at the Happendon/Cairn Lodge services, Mainshill Wood opencast site offers more, highly unusual geological formations, where the pressures from millennia ago have left vertical coal and limestone seams. The topography and location suggest this has more potential as a family-oriented leisure attraction, whereas Spireslack could work better for the committed thrill-seeker. The ponds on the site are considered ripe for arrays of solar panels or (safety-conscious) leisure boating. As it currently stands, some of the site would work well as a science fiction film set. According to Prof Griggs, local communities often see only vast scars on the landscape around them, and want them healed. He is encouraging them to see the sites as opportunities to make something out of the new contours of the land. ""I never thought I'd become one of Scotland's biggest landowners,"" he joked. ""It's been great fun doing this. I've learned things. I think everyone should go through life and learn new things. I've met some fascinating people as I've gone through this, and I understand a bit more about geology now. ""But I'm sure the communities will say 'it's not fun having a big hole on my doorstep'. So my real fun will be when I get all the communities back to getting these sorted out for them"".","Russel Griggs has become one of Scotland's biggest landowners, to his astonishment."
"Thirteen visitors, including an 11-week-old baby, and a member of staff were rescued from Weymouth's Jurassic Skyline tower on 5 September. Operator Merlin Entertainments said there was a mechanical fault within the unit that controls the speed. However, a recovery process to lower the ride to ground level did not work. Instead the emergency brake remained engaged on the tower, which is currently closed for the winter, requiring the assistance of the emergency services, Poole-based Merlin Entertainments said. The company said: ""Since the incident we have worked with the ride manufacturers and an independent inspection body to identify why we weren't able lower the ride using these processes and have implemented appropriate measures to further assist recovery in the case of a mid-flight stoppage."" It added the speed governor unit had been replaced, the tower had undergone ""rigorous testing"" by internal engineers and an independent inspection body, and a specialist rope recovery team had been appointed ""to provide further support to our local team"". Since the attraction opened in 2012, Merlin Entertainment said a ""comprehensive evacuation plan"" had been in place and was regularly practised. Peter Hyre, from Essex, was among the group that got stuck in the attraction's 37m (121ft) capsule. He previously described it as a ""horrendous"" experience. The rescue operation began after fire crews were called at about 16:15 BST and ascended the tower. The coastguard helicopter was then called in at about 19:30, when other rescue options were ruled out because of bad weather. Merlin Entertainments said ""all parties involved"" had since accepted compensation from the firm, but it refused to give further details.","A 53m-high (174ft) viewing tower that broke down trapping 14 people for seven hours now has a specialist rope recovery team, its operator has said."

"By Ione WellsBBC Wales Westminster correspondent The Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said MPs cannot do their jobs properly via video link and has asked them to return on 2 June. Mr Rees-Mogg says he wants MPs to set an ""example"" to the public. But Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards says it would set a ""bad example"" for Welsh MPs to travel to London against Welsh Government advice. Mr Rees-Mogg said he is looking at ways to allow MPs who are part of the ""shielded"" group, and have been advised to stay at home, to still participate - and has agreed that MPs' staff and Parliamentary workers can continue to work from home. But he rejected calls from opposition MPs to extend hybrid working, or to allow working from home on non-substantive matters such as ministerial questions and only travelling to Westminster to take part in key votes. For the past few weeks, MPs have been able to take part in debates and ask questions via Zoom - and even vote remotely. No more than 50 MPs have been allowed in the Chamber at the same time to enforce social distancing regulations. The Commons chamber is likely to remain limited to 50 MPs and voting could take much longer than it did before the coronavirus lockdown when MPs return. Mr Rees-Mogg said on Wednesday that the hybrid Parliament had an ""impact on legislative scrutiny"" and meant debate was ""becoming stilted."" He added: ""In line with government advice for those who cannot do their jobs from home, I am asking members to return to their place of work"", and said social distancing would be observed and Parliament would become a ""Covid-19 secure workplace."" This statement was criticised by the Shadow Leader of the House of Commons Valerie Vaz who referenced MPs contributing via video link and said government advice was ""if you can work at home you should do so"". The decision asking MPs to return to Westminster has attracted wide criticism from opposition MPs in Wales, where the current Welsh Government regulations say people should work from home if they can, and only travel to other destinations for essential purposes. Chris Elmore, Labour MP for Ogmore, told BBC Wales: ""My primary concern is that politicians are advocating the public health advice is followed. ""Clearly, the Welsh Government advice is different to the UK government advice that in essence is for England. And my primary concern is that the government in Westminster are putting unnecessary risk to staff in the House of Commons, and of course others who work around the estate."" The speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has previously said he could suspend sittings if it became too crowded and that it could take an hour for MPs to vote in person while maintaining social distancing rules. 'Prolonged process' Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards told BBC Wales he was concerned about voting in person with social distancing measures in place: ""That's going to be a far longer, prolonged process with two metre gaps between everybody walking through to vote. ""Spending hours and hours and hours a day walking through a room to record your vote is not a particularly efficient use of an elected member's time."" Mr Rees-Mogg faced fresh accusations from Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael that asking MPs to return was ""to get support back for the Prime Minister at PMQs"" and ""shield the government from scrutiny."" Labour Cardiff West MP Kevin Brennan had previously tweeted: ""I think Rees-Mogg wants the House of Commons back in person so that Boris Johnson is not left alone at PMQs desperately looking about for support from empty loyal benches as he flounders trying to wriggle of the hook of Keir Starmer's penetrating interrogation."" But Mr Rees-Mogg called reports this move was to get support for the Prime Minister at PMQs ""trivial"". Some Conservative MPs have welcomed the idea of a return to business as usual, with sources telling BBC Wales that they have expressed concerns about sacrificing traditional procedures and scrutiny at this time.",Welsh opposition MPs have criticised plans for members to return to Westminster.
"Mr Burnham praised his party leader Ed Miliband's proposal to reward firms for paying low paid workers more than the minimum wage. But he said the Labour leader should ""go further"" and vow to ban so-called zero hours contracts as well. Workers on such contracts are on call to work but can be given no hours and, as a result, no pay. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Burnham hit back at claims Labour has no concrete policy ideas, saying ""we are beginning now to set out our stall"" ahead of the 2015 general election. He is promoting his own plan to merge social care for the elderly and the infirm, often controlled by local authorities, with the NHS, which he says will save money and improve standards. 'Crude politics' But he also said Labour had to do more to present itself as the ""party of work"". The Labour leadership has faced criticism from Conservatives and even some within its own ranks for appearing to be on the side of benefit cheats and people who do not want to work. Mr Burnham said: ""The coalition have tried to take forward the benefits debate by dividing people between strivers and skivers. ""I think it's really crude and unpleasant politics. What Ed Miliband is saying is we have got to do away with that."" He said many people on benefits were in work, or did not get enough hours to work, which meant ""we subsidise low pay in this country"". ""A living wage could really help to address that and I would say to Ed, personally, go further and ban things like zero hours contracts. ""That is a Labour response to the debate about work and benefits."" 'Living wage' Ed Miliband told The Guardian on Saturday he wanted to offer tax breaks to persuade companies to pay more to low paid workers. He said Labour would create special zones where businesses would be encouraged to pay the ""living wage,"" which, according to campaigners, is Â£8.55 an hour in London and Â£7.45 in the rest of the UK. The UK-wide minimum wage is Â£6.19. Mr Miliband suggested firms could offered tax relief on training or capital investment, or lower business rates, in return for paying the living wage. The proposal is being considered as part of Labour's policy review. More than 200,000 British workers are on zero hours contracts, according to the Office for National Statistics. The retail and finance sectors make the most use of such contracts but the practice is spreading to education, the public services and the NHS. Labour MPs and trade unions say zero hours contracts strip workers of their rights and are exploitative. They say employers are using them to avoid agency worker regulations, which entitle agency staff to the same basic terms and conditions as permanent employees after 12 weeks. But the CBI says the UK's flexible labour market is crucial to economic recovery and the new agency worker rules are holding back growth.","Labour should pledge to ban ""zero hours contracts"" at the next election, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham has said."
"By Sanjana Deen and Catrin NyeBBC Asian Network Sacred Sounds sing spiritual chants and religious music from a range of faith communities, including Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, Sikh, Jewish and Muslim. The choir is just over three months old and will perform on 7 July at the city's Bridgewater Hall. Choirmaster Beth Allen said: ""It's very unusual to be singing other people's sacred music and there's nothing like the feeling that comes from that."" Ms Allen added: ""I knew it was going to be amazing because I am interested in language. Yet singing other people's material that belongs to their culture, history, souls and hearts has been beautiful."" Members of the choir were not required to have previous choral experience but there are experienced singers in the group, including Reshmi Dave, a trained singer who represents the Hindu faith. She said she had never previously sung in such a large group, let alone used the songs of other faiths. ""Hindus don't normally have what is known as choir singing, so I was excited about taking part and getting my friends to join. I didn't know there were so many songs in other faiths. When we wore our saris and did our first performance using a Jewish song, I thought that was brilliant,"" she said. Sacred Sounds was created as part of the Manchester International Festival and was inspired by a previous project called Sacred Sites - a celebration of religious chants in Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish and Sikh sites of worship across Manchester. Retired teacher and choir member Asha Buch said Sacred Sounds is representative of Manchester's multi-faith tolerance. ""We knew that Manchester is cohesive. Yet to experience it and confirm it is a wonderful feeling. Many of us in the choir can't read western musical scores, so it's sung to us. Hindi and Punjabi Sikh chants don't have notation, so Beth makes up a dot notation for everybody,"" she said. Ms Allen's notations have allowed the group to sing songs in languages unknown to them - such as a Buddhist chant called White Tara, in Pali, and one of the oldest Muslim nasheeds, Tala al Badru Alayna, in Arabic. The choir will be premiering If Ye Love Me, a piece composed especially for them by maestro Sir John Tavener. Jennifer Cleary, Manchester International Festival's creative director, explained how the collaboration came about: ""John Tavener has been inspired by faith throughout his career and recently, has perhaps taken a more universalist philosophy towards his work. ""He wrote a meditation on the 99 Names of Allah or God in Islam, and he'll be premiering a piece inspired by the tale of Krishna, a Hindu god, at the festival this year. So we approached him about writing a piece specifically for this choir, which he was really excited about,"" she said. Sacred Sounds will also be performing with acclaimed Pakistani Sufi artist, Abida Parveen. Choir member Sarah Yaseen said she grew up with the singer's music and is elated at the idea of sharing a stage with her: ""My father taught me how to sing as I child so I learnt a few of Abida Parveen's songs. ""I love her style. Reading poetry in Urdu is fine, but singing it, you really need training. Whether she sings compositions by poet Bulleh Shah or her own, it's incredible to hear the way it resonates from her. To have the opportunity to sing with Abida Parveen, I feel it's a real achievement."" The MIF Sacred Sounds Women's Choir will be performing with the BBC Philharmonic in a concert of new works by Sir John Tavener at the Bridgewater Hall on 7 July. It is part of Manchester International Festival's summer programme, which will be running from 4 - 21 July 2013.

"Thousands of people gathered outside the minster and cheered as the Queen arrived for the service. The Dean of York said the minster was honoured to have been chosen to host the service, which was last held in the city in 1972. York is one of the few cathedrals outside London to have been asked to hold the service for a second time. As the Queen arrived at the minster, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess Beatrice of York, people could be seen toasting her with champagne in windows overlooking the street. Dressed in grey tweed overcoat and aquamarine hat, the Queen had to touch a ceremonial sword and mace before passing through the 12th Century gateway to the walled city, Micklegate Bar. To mark her Diamond Jubilee, the Queen handed out money to people from all of the UK's 44 Christian dioceses. Usually, the Maundy money is given to people from a single diocese. But this year, 86 women and 86 men - one for each of the Queen's 86 years - received the money in recognition of their services to the Church and their communities. The royal party was greeted with rapturous applause and cheering as they emerged on to the steps of the Minster following the hour-long service. The Dean of York, The Very Reverend Keith Jones, said the Queen had specifically requested that this year's service was a large one reflecting the celebrations for her Diamond Jubilee. ""We are given to understand that this service is very important to The Queen,"" he said. Dean Jones said those receiving the Maundy money were all aged over 70 and had made valuable contributions to their neighbours, community and church. Alf Patrick, 90, from York, who played for York City Football Club in the 1940s and 50s is one of the men selected to receive the Maundy money. Mr Patrick said he had been ""dumbfounded"" to receive the invitation. Recipients will received two purses from the Sovereign, a red and a white one. The red purse contains a small amount of money in lieu of food and clothing. The white purse contains silver Maundy coins consisting of the same number of pence as the years of the sovereign's age.",The Queen has handed out traditional Royal Maundy money to 172 people during a service at York Minster.
"Cameras installed by the BBC have captured men running towards trucks and climbing beneath the vehicles, with drivers oblivious to their actions. Two migrants were recently killed in attempts to get to Dover. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said there had been an ""increase"" in people trying to get into the UK through the Channel ports. 'Just frightening' This was mainly due to conflict in the Middle East and North Africa, he explained. Lorry driver Clive Mills, whose truck had been used by migrants, said: ""I would never have known they were on there. I didn't even see them get on. ""I was looking in the mirror, looking down the road to pull out - it's just frightening. ""Something somewhere has to change because you can kill people."" Mr Mills had allowed BBC South East Today to film his lorry as he drove to the port. The BBC's cameras were attached to another lorry, which stopped as soon as the migrants were filmed, so as not to endanger their lives. French police were also called. Speaking to BBC South East after being shown some of the footage, David Cameron said: ""We are strengthening our borders, we're returning more people who get here illegally. ""We've invested in the UK Border Force that's doing a good job and we're also making sure that people who come here can't immediately claim benefits."" ""Immigration is a major concern for people in this country and it's a major concern for me,"" the prime minister added. Colin Campbell, BBC South East Today's home affairs correspondent, said gangs of migrants swarm up on to the approach road into the port as lorries approach. 'Amongst squalor' ""Calais is again experiencing a surge in migrant numbers,"" he said. ""Many Syrians are now arriving here - they say they've fled war and persecution. ""Others have come from Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Eritrea. ""There's estimated to be more than 400. Most are sleeping amongst squalor in the largest makeshift camp right next to the port."" After one migrant was seen climbing on to a truck, and was told he was risking his life, he said: ""I know, but I have to go there. ""This country is not good to live in, we have to go to England."" And when told of the risks, another group of migrants said: ""We don't care. It doesn't matter. We don't care anyway. ""I'm sorry, I'm so sorry... we are sorry."" George Gillas Sallam, a French charity worker who supplies migrants with food, said two had recently been killed and ""nothing"" was being done. Heartbeat detectors ""They've found a place for them in the cemetery, that's all I think,"" he said. ""Some bodies have been repatriated, but that's one line in the newspaper in Calais."" Mr Brokenshire said there was a ""good working relationship"" between the British and French authorities. ""We've invested Â£2m on additional detection equipment, so that's looking at heart beat detectors, carbon dioxide detectors and also the sniffer dogs as well,"" he said. ""There have been indications of an increase in the number of people trying to get to the UK through the Channel ports.

The product is one of hundreds of exhibits at Edinburgh Napier's More Than A Degree Show. The student believes her tableware could help highlight the opportunities that upcycling waste eggshells can bring. Ms Zupan said: ""The idea literally came to me one day as I was making scrambled eggs in the house and after some extensive research I found that despite eggshells carrying a range of beneficial components, very little was actually being done to upcycle waste product. ""I tested eggshell powder in a range of formats - including adding it to muffins, into plaster for egg cups and even cement and other resins but it was the tableware idea that really caught my imagination."" She added: ""I think I've managed to produce a sophisticated product that has the potential to highlight a new method of producing sustainable tableware and cutlery - it's been really exciting to work on."" Richard Firth, programme leader for the product design course, said: ""Martina's commitment, determination and drive to try and try again has been rewarded in a design project that is truly unique with the potential to achieve real change with regard to how we think about materials, design our products and how we engage with producing our products within the 21st Century.""

"Manchester Crown Court was told four-week old Goodluck Caubergs died the day after Grace Adeleye carried out the procedure without anaesthetic. Sylvia Attiko, Goodluck's mother, wept as she recalled events at her home in Greater Manchester in April 2010. Mrs Adeleye, 66, denies manslaughter by gross negligence. 'Ragged' wound The court was told the procedure took place on a low table in the living room at the home in Chadderton, with Mrs Adeleye only using scissors, forceps and olive oil. The property is a mile and a half from Royal Oldham Hospital, the jury was told. It is alleged the defendant, who was paid Â£100 to carry out the procedure, left a ""ragged"" wound that bled. She then used cotton wool and a brown liquid, which Ms Attiko took to be iodine, to clean the wound before a white bandage was applied to the cut. Adrian Darbishire QC, prosecuting, asked Ms Attiko: ""Did she say anything about possible complications, things that could go wrong? ""No,"" she said. ""Any warnings about a danger sign? Bleeding - to how much was normal or abnormal?"" Mr Darbishire added. Ms Attiko replied again: ""No."" She said Mrs Adeleye, of Sarnia Court, Salford, told her it was normal for the wound to bleed and it would stop. The court heard Goodluck died from blood loss within 24 hours. The court heard Ms Attiko is from Lagos, Nigeria and came to the UK in 2008 on a student visa to study. Ms Attiko told the court that Nigerians in the UK who have sons tend to have them circumcised at home some time after the boy is eight days old. She said she had not met Mrs Adeleye before and that she was recommended through a family friend. The court heard that Mrs Adeleye gave the child some Calpol, then instructed Ms Attiko how to rebandage the wound before leaving.

Former Wales captain Sam Warburton - who went to the same school as Thomas - tweeted: ""Absolutely awesome."" Parts of Wales - including Cardiff city hall - will be lit yellow later to mark the remarkable achievement. A stunning performance during the time trial on the penultimate stage on Saturday meant Thomas goes into Paris holding onto the yellow jersey, and nearly two minutes in front of nearest rival Tom Domoulin. The cycling tour's convention dictates that the wearer of the yellow jersey is never attacked on the final day - it is a procession for the tour winner. His friend and former Whitchurch High School schoolmate Sam Warburton added it ""couldn't happen to a nicer guy"". ""It's insane. Tour de France! I can't believe it,"" said an emotional Thomas on after Saturday's 31km time trial. ""I'm really trying not to cry, it's unbelievable. I tried not to think about it, just take it day by day. I've won the Tour de France man, I don't know what to say. ""The last time I cried was when I got married and I don't know what's happened to me.""

"The families of former miners have been asked to contribute to a sculpture which sits at the centre of the garden. Lives Lived Lives Lost is a steel structure which has space to hold glass discs containing miners' names. The Matlby Miners Welfare Band performed at the opening ceremony, which also included short readings. Rosemary Priest, from the museum, said the idea for the garden had come from visitors: ""They wanted somewhere they could sit and think about the people who had lived or died within the industry."" She said the sculpture, commissioned from artist Stephen Broadbent, stood about 9ft (3m) high and curved round in a sweeping arc. It is designed to suggest a seam of coal pierced by mine workings. The glass discs are placed into channels representing the shafts and levels of a mine.

"Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) members had planned a 24-hour walkout on Southern, Merseyrail and Northern (Arriva Rail North) on 30 May. The union's general secretary Mick Cash said: ""Our thoughts and solidarity are with the people of Manchester."" Twenty-two people were killed and 59 injured in a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday night. Armed police have arrested a 23-year-old man in Chorlton, south Manchester, in connection with the attack at the city's arena. Mr Cash said: ""In light of the horrific bombing in Manchester last night, and the heightened safety and security alerts on our transport services, RMT's executive has taken the decision to suspend the 24 hours of strike action scheduled for 30th May."" The year-long dispute is over staffing and plans to introduce new driver-operated-only trains. It would have been the 32nd day of action by Southern workers, after talks between the rail companies and union representatives broke down on 15 May. A Southern spokesman said: ""This is an appropriate response by the RMT to the tragedy in Manchester.""",A strike by rail workers across the country has been called off in light of the Manchester bombing.
"By Sitala PeekBBC News ""The French are very vocal, they need to express themselves and share the confusion and pain,"" says Pascal Grierson, the CEO of French Radio London - a dedicated French language broadcaster for expats. The station's core audience is the thousands of French citizens living in London who are now so numerous, former president Nicolas Sarkozy dubbed it the sixth largest French city in the world. ""We've been monitoring our social media channels and there's a couple of dominant themes coming out,"" Mr Grierson says. ""The main one is, 'why is it France that has been targeted?' ""In comparison to the Charlie Hebdo attacks, this feels more random and ended up killing people of their own proclaimed faith. ""The French have a very tense relationship with the Muslim community in France anyway. What underlies all of this is the attackers' attempt to destabilise our relationship further with the French-Arab community. ""On social media people have been telling us they want the fascist right wing to rise because then Daesh [the so-called Islamic State group] will have a proper fight on their hands."" Marine Le Pen's far-right Front National party is predicted to gain seats in France's regional elections in December and earlier she called for an ""immediate halt"" to France accepting any more refugees in the wake of the Paris attacks. President Francois Hollande has ordered air strikes on Isis targets in Syria in response to the multiple attacks in Paris. ""Up until the air raids started last night, people were calling for some sort of retaliation,"" says Mr Grierson. ""French people are relieved by that. ""What we haven't seen yet is the French Arab perspective on this. I have heard some Muslims in this country [UK] talk about how they feel but I think French Arabs in France are keeping their heads down at the moment, largely, except to join in condemning these attacks. ""So many are good people and non-radicalised, but they have a big PR problem and they are going to need to work on that."" Wali Deruwara identifies himself as a French Arab. The 18-year-old of Malian descent has a job in a French cafe in South Kensington but comes from Paris's suburbs. ""It's normal for people to be scared of Paris after this,"" he says. But ""it's not right"" they should blame migrants, he continues. ""There were black people that died in these attacks, it's not just white people,"" he said. ""It happened very close to where I used to live, next to the Place de Voges,"" a 48-year-old French mother called Virgine tells me. She now lives with her family in Fulham, south-west London, but used to live in the 3rd arrondissement close to where the attacks happened in the 11th arrondissement. ""When I saw the pictures on the news, I recognised all the places I used to shop and eat and go out. ""I have friends that were in the Bataclan concert hall. Some of them were wounded but not killed, thankfully. It took some time for them to get any news through to us from the hospital."" She was struck by a sense of helplessness, increased by her physical separation from her home country. ""That's why I felt I had to take my children and go down to Trafalgar Square, just to feel like I was doing something."" Thousands attended an impromptu vigil held in Trafalgar Square on Saturday night organised by Theo Rampal, a restaurant manager from Marseille who lives in Surrey Quays, south-east London. ""I did it to support our families. We are not able to go back to France in this moment, we are not doctors, but this is one way that we could feel like we were helping them from far away."" He estimates at least 6,000 people attended the event. ""My cousin was in a nightclub behind the Bataclan. She went outside for some reason and saw people shooting into the hall. ""She was confused at first because she didn't understand what was happening then she found a hiding place until police told her it was safe to come out after about five hours, but she heard the screams and was so upset. ""I don't know whether what we did in Trafalgar Square helped at all, but I hope so, to let them know we are thinking of them all,"" he says. ""I got the breaking news of the attacks on my phone and instantly started texting my friends and everyone I knew out there. It took a while for some people to text me back. I waited for about 24 hours not knowing if they were OK or not. It was awful,"" says Alice, an 18-year-old humanities student at University College London. She lives with her parents in Notting Hill, west London, and has friends in Paris and relatives who live in Bolougne Billancourt in the west of the city. ""No-one I knew was badly hurt but friends of mine have lost people and its hurts me the same as if I knew them. It could have been any one of us - they were just people at a concert or going out for dinner, just going about their normal lives. That's what is so scary about it. ""One of my cousins lives in that area and was in an apartment above the cafe that people were being shot in and heard everything. ""I just really want to go back to Paris to see my family, even though I know they are safe. I have grown up in London but at a time like this I just want to be with everyone so that we are all together. ""That's why I went to Trafalgar Square, I just had to be with other people to share what we are all going through."" The streets around the Lycee in South Kensington were deserted at the weekend she says and there was a large police presence around the building. Pupils were told not to hang about outside the French Institute or the school during break time. ""This situation is just going to get worse,"" a French pastry chef tells me. Joachim Prat, 31, lives in Clapham and runs a patisserie in South Kensington. He says there is no point in mass gatherings to show solidarity. ""Don't get me wrong, I think it's crazy what has happened. But it won't make any difference if we stand in a square together and hold a flag in fraternity. What will it change this solidarity? Bombing won't help either. You don't stop these people hating you by bombing them."" Surdad Kargoli, 44, from South Kensington, originally comes from Baghdad and settled in Ivy-sur-Seine, a suburb in south-east Paris many years ago. ""I think people know there is a difference between Muslims and what these people are who did this in Paris,"" he says. ""It's become like a disease, people are being infected with this violence and hatred. I am scared about what is going to happen to France in future generations, if we are raising people who can do this to their country, because it's their country as well in some cases.

"City Council leader John Clancy said work would be carried out ""as a matter of urgency"". He is setting aside Â£31m for the retro-fit but is urging the government to set up a fund to help councils across the country pay for the adaptations. The council will be forced to sell assets if government help is not forthcoming, a statement said. Councillor Clancy has written to the leaders of Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield councils calling for them to support his campaign. 'National emergency' ""The dreadful events in London have understandably triggered an outburst of public anger and demands that councils need to do far more to protect tenants living in high-rise blocks,"" he said. He added: ""The government should accept this is a national emergency that fully justifies establishing a fund to allow councils to fit sprinkler systems as a matter of urgency. ""If the government fails to respond appropriately, I believe our tenants would expect work on less important building projects to be delayed so that we can make sure our tower blocks are safer places to live in."" The council said it carried out daily safety inspections at its blocks of flats. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said he could not comment on specifics but said the Prime Minister had said on Thursday that councils can discuss the cost of building modification to mitigate fire risk with them.",All of Birmingham's 213 tower blocks will have sprinklers fitted in the wake of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
"It follows a Â£330m deal announced last month involving Liberty House and Simec to take over the Rio Tinto site. Their plans include creating an aluminium wheel manufacturing facility, and a further 300 jobs directly, with another 300 in the supply chain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the site on Monday. Liberty said it aimed to protect the existing 170 jobs in Lochaber and expand metal manufacturing and downstream engineering there. 'New chapter' The purchase by Liberty and Simec - both members of the GFG Alliance - includes the hydro power plants at Fort William and Kinlochleven and more than 100,000 acres of land hosting the water catchment area, including Ben Nevis' foothills. The Scottish government is supporting the plans by guaranteeing the power purchases of the aluminium smelter. Ms Sturgeon said the proposals reinforced the link between the smelter and the hydro station at Fort William. She described it as a ""historic day"" for the smelter and said she looked forward to hundreds of new jobs in the area in the coming years. She added: ""Today is the start of an exciting new chapter in Scotland's manufacturing story and the Scottish government and its agencies will keep working with Sanjeev Gupta and the GFG Alliance to help them realise their enterprising vision for Lochaber."" 'Bright new future' Sanjeev Gupta, executive chairman of Liberty House Group and of the GFG Alliance strategic board, said: ""We hope this day will come to be recognised as the start of a bright new future for Highland industry. ""It puts Lochaber right at the heart of our vision for sustainable and integrated local production that can revitalise British manufacturing."" Mr Gupta and Ms Sturgeon were among those who attended the announcement who wore a bindi, a symbol of Mr Gupta's Hindu faith. Jay Hambro, chief investment officer of the GFG Alliance, and chief executive of Simec energy & mining divisions said: ""These hydro-power stations have enough capacity to power around 83,000 homes. ""Today Lochaber provides the power required to produce 47,000 tonnes of aluminium. We have already identified investment programmes to significantly increase power generation from the existing assets and are studying how to create further capacity locally."" The purchase of Lochaber represents a major escalation of the GFG Alliance's investment in Scotland, following Liberty's acquisition of the Dalzell and Clydebridge Steel plants earlier this year. Dalzell formally restarted in September after being mothballed by its previous owners.",Plans to create up to 600 jobs and invest Â£120m at the site of the UK's last remaining aluminium smelter yard at Fort William have been announced.
"Five of eight Beechey brothers - who fought all over the world - were killed during the conflict. Fundraiser and former mayor's officer Joe Cooke, who started a petition, said it was important to recognise the sacrifice of the family. He also wants to erect a plaque on the Beecheys' former home in Avondale Street. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire Mr Cooke, who has worked on numerous projects, including the restoration of the grave of the boy's mother - Amy Beechey - said his Facebook post calling for them to be recognised had been well received. He now plans to contact officials about getting a new street named in honour of the family. ""There are new houses being built across the city, and it wouldn't hurt to call one Beechey Road."" ""So, fingers crossed it will happen,"" he said. Mr Cooke said he was also trying to contact the current owner of the brothers' former home about getting a blue plaque placed on the house. ""It would be good to show the comings and goings,"" he said. The house is where Amy Beechey received the message that began 'it is my painful duty to inform youâ¦' five times. All eight of her sons enlisted but only three returned. Barnard, aged 38, Charles, 39, Leonard 36, Frank 30, and Harold 26 all died in action or of wounds soon after.

"Mark EastonHome editor@BBCMarkEastonon Twitter Boston is an ancient English port and market town in the flatlands of Lincolnshire. But it is a town transformed by rapid and significant immigration from Eastern Europe. Where once there would have been the butcher, the baker and, quite possibly, the candlestick-maker, the High Street is now filled with Baltic supermarkets, Polish delis and Lithuanian off-licences. As you walk through the old streets, you hear foreign voices - mothers pushing their children to nursery, farm-workers heading home after a day in the fields - and this rapid cultural change has made the town feel uneasy. Police admit they ""had their head in the sand"" when considering the impact immigration would have on Boston. They admit they were too slow to spot the risks and now conduct regular community tension assessments. Police staff scan Twitter and Facebook and will intervene to stop rumours and misinformation spreading. It was, though, the speed of change that locals found disconcerting. In 2001 virtually everyone in Boston was white British. Ten years later it was just 84% - a dramatic cultural shift that saw tensions spill over into protest. Twelve months ago, 300 people gathered in central Boston to voice concerns at the impact immigration was having on their town. For some, it was economic - they blamed foreign migrants for the shortage of jobs and stretched public services following the financial crash. For others, it was cultural - they felt the town they knew and loved had been taken away from them. New arrivals There are clear lessons for the authorities considering how they should respond to the potential arrival of large numbers of Romanians and Bulgarians. Public agencies now meet regularly to consider the impact of migration on the community cohesion of the town. At one local school, two-thirds of pupils are now from migrant households. Exam results are excellent here and it's seen as a model of good practice. But the prospect of yet more immigration without extra resources is a concern. However, some local farmers and businessmen have a different view of how immigration has affected Boston. Before the East European influx, the town was already facing significant economic challenges. Many young people were leaving the area, the town was becoming older and poorer. The arrival of keen, young workers helped some businesses to expand and the farmers' union has complained that local people are often reluctant even to apply for low paid manual jobs. But Boston is exceptional. Although Eastern European immigration has touched almost every community in the United Kingdom, the impact has rarely been as dramatic as in this corner of the Fens. Nevertheless, the message from the town is that people must prepare for new arrivals, monitor their impact if they do come, and look for ways to deal with the unease that goes with rapid cultural change.","The pace of immigration in Boston, Lincolnshire has left locals feeling disconcerted, but the town must prepare for more new arrivals."
"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The proportion of entries marked as A*-C has risen by 1.1% to 82.2% in 2019. However, the number of top A* grades has fallen from 9.9% of entries last year to 7.7% in 2019. A new C* grade has also been introduced in Northern Ireland. Thousands of pupils across Northern Ireland received their GCSE results on Thursday. Twin sisters, Lucy and Katie Knox, both 16, are pupils at New-Bridge Integrated College in Loughbrickland, County Down. It was an A, A*, three Bs and 3Cs for Lucy, who would like to be a graphic designer. ""I am so happy,"" she said. ""I have got all the results that I need, and they are high as well. ""I didn't sleep last night at all, so it has been quite nerve-wracking."" Her sister, Katie, gained eight GCSEs from A* to C grade and is going to college to study health and social care. Being twins made them a ""wee bit more nervous"", she said. ""If one of us had failed and the other one passed, it would have been scary,"" she added. Jack Moore, from the same school, said he had received mostly As and Bs and was ""absolutely ecstatic"". Jack, who would like to become a primary school teacher, said: ""These past two months have been such hard work - blood, sweat and tears, everything, and I am so happy it has all paid off in the end"". Elsewhere, Grace Dickson, from Lisneal College in Londonderry, said she had gained 10 GCSEs and was ""very pleased"". ""I am going to do A-levels now, double health and social and business,"" she said. ""It is a big relief."" Disadvantaged backgrounds About 5,500 GCSE entries in Northern Ireland this year were made through English exam boards which means that some pupils received results in the form of numbers as well as letters. That is because GCSEs in England are now graded numerically from 9 to 1. The fall in the proportion of A* grades is mainly due to alignment with the top 9 grade in England. Northern Ireland's exams board CCEA has, however, maintained the A*-G grading system - although introducing the new C* grade. The vast majority of GCSEs (96.6%) are studied through CCEA. The performance gap between girls and boys closed slightly in 2019. The percentage of GCSE entries from boys awarded A*-C is 78.5%, up 1.6% on 2018. The number of A*-C grades awarded to entries from girls rose by 0.5% to 85.6%. There were also increases in the number of A*-C grades awarded to entries in both Maths and English Language. While GCSE results and some statistics are released today, full details of how pupils performed this year will not be available for a few months. In 2018, 71.8% of pupils in Northern Ireland achieved at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C including English and Maths. However, fewer pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds got those qualifications. Slightly more than half (51.8%) of pupils entitled to free school meals (FSME) got at least five GCSEs at grades A*-C including English and Maths in 2018. Northern Ireland's most recent programme for government aimed to reduce educational inequality by increasing the number of disadvantaged young people attaining those GCSE grades.",There has been a rise in the number of GCSE entries awarded A*-C grades in Northern Ireland.
"By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has given the Highways Agency 18 months to devise alternative methods to tackle pollution on a 32 mile stretch of the M1 in Derbyshire and South Yorkshire and 2.8 miles of the M3 in Surrey. If none can be found a 60mph limit could still be imposed at peak times. But Mr McLoughlin has ruled out a blanket cut in the speed limit. The Highways Agency has been asked to look at different ways of measuring local air quality. 'Smart highways' It is also looking at alternative methods of cutting pollution, such as erecting high barriers along the relevant sections of the motorway to funnel fumes away from ground level. These have been found to cut pollution and noise in large-scale tests in Holland, where speed limits have also been reduced on busy trunk roads amid concern about air quality. Another option might be banning heavily-polluting vehicles at certain times. The air quality concern about the M1 and M3 focused on road-widening schemes aimed at cutting congestion. Construction is about to begin on converting two sections of the M1, between junctions 28 and 31 in Derbyshire and junctions 32 and 35a in South Yorkshire, and on the M3, between junctions 2 and 4a to allow hard shoulder running either permanently or at busy periods. The speed limit can be varied or lanes closed in emergencies through the use of overhead message signs. The government claims these so-called ""smart motorways"" will increase capacity by a third and improve journey times up to 10% through the M1 schemes and 15% on the M3, where average speeds are currently 45mph during rush-hour. But the Highways Agency is concerned that the extra traffic will mean they will break EU air quality rules, and harm the health of people living and working near the motorways. It consulted on proposals to limit speeds to 60mph between 7am and 7pm seven days a week to cut pollution. 'Strongly opposed' But Mr McLoughlin has rejected this approach, saying the government was committed to maintaining the 70mph limit on motorways, particularly at weekends and other periods when traffic was lighter. He said: ""Let me be absolutely clear, I want all motorways to run at 70mph. While it sometimes makes sense to use variable limits to keep people moving, blanket reductions are not acceptable. ""Smart motorways are an effective and cost efficient way of increasing space on our roads, cutting jams and speeding up journey times and I am pleased to announce the start of work on these schemes."" Mr McLoughlin has ordered the Highways Agency to ""rigorously investigate alternatives"" to the blanket cut in the speed limit as work progresses on the schemes in the next 12 to 18 months. In the meantime, the Highways Agency will take the legal powers it needs to reduce the speed limit from 70mph at certain times, the Transport department said. The proposed cut to the speed limit on the M1 was rejected by 93% of people who took part in an online consultation - and it was also strongly opposed by businesses and local authorities. The M3 consultation has yet to be published. 'Health emergency' RAC technical director David Bizley said he was pleased that Mr McLoughlin had ""listened to road users and recognised that a 60mph limit on these stretches of the M1 and M3 is the thin end of the wedge"". ""However, we also should be mindful that a solution that does not breach air quality limits and keeps traffic moving at 70mph may not be achievable. Let's hope, for the sake of motorists and businesses alike, that it is."" The AA said it was a ""victory for common sense"". But the Green Party of England and Wales criticised the decision. Local transport spokeswoman Caroline Russell said: ""Air pollution is a public health emergency and seriously affects the health of those travelling in cars and those living nearby to busy roads. ""Cutting the speed limit to 60mph is a sensible suggestion, it would cut pollution, cut fuel costs for motorists and increase road capacity as slower moving vehicles need shorter stopping distances. ""If Mr McLoughlin really wants to deliver smart motorways he should seize this opportunity to improve journey time reliability and protect our health with 60mph motorway limits."" The Transport department said pollution would be reduced as more low emission vehicles came into use, but progress on this had not been as fast as hoped.",Plans to impose a 60mph speed limit on parts of the M3 and M1 motorways to cut air pollution have been put on hold.
"Air Southwest is ending the Plymouth to Gatwick route - which goes via Newquay - as new owner Humberside-based Eastern Airways is seeking to cut costs. The airline is blaming falling passenger numbers and high landing fees at Gatwick for the cut. The move means no airlines will offer flights from Devon to the capital. It also sees Air Southwest axing its Newquay to Gatwick flights. The flight left Plymouth at 1630 GMT, flew to Newquay and then departed for London from Cornwall at 1705 GMT. Air Southwest, which was founded in 2003, scrapped its service to London City Airport last May. Airport's days 'numbered' Flybe will become the only airline offering a London service from South West England, with its flights from Newquay to Gatwick, but no flights from Devon. The Devon and Cornwall Business Council described Air Southwest's decision as ""inevitable"", but a ""major blow"" to the economy in both counties. Last week, Plymouth's Chamber of Commerce said its final attempt to persuade Air Southwest to maintain the London link failed. Business leaders and local economists have said they now fear for the future of Plymouth Airport itself because of the cutting of the route. Professor Peter Gripaios from the University of Plymouth said he believed the airport's days were ""probably numbered"". He said: ""It's never really had enough of a catchment area. The population isn't really big enough - you need about four million people in an area. ""It's being squeezed by flights into Newquay and Exeter, and even more probably by the fact that Easjyet and Ryanair have loads and loads of flights going out of Bristol."" Airport owner Sutton Harbour Holdings said the the airport has made losses, but said it had no intention of making knee-jerk reactions based on the loss of one route. The city has had an operational airport at its current location since 1925.",The last flight between Plymouth and London has taken off.

"The first minister said there were ""early optimistic signs"" that social distancing measures were having an impact on the spread of the virus. But she said that ""until we know more and have solid evidence, we must stick with it"". She said the lockdown would not be in place ""for a single minute longer than necessary"", but it remains ""essential"". Interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith also said the lockdown measures were expected to remain in place for a ""significant period of time"". Ms Sturgeon said a total of 6,076 Scots had now tested positive for coronavirus, although she stressed that this would be an under-estimate and did not include figures from some local laboratories. She said there were 1,797 patients in hospital, 211 of whom are in intensive care. And a further nine people have died after testing positive for the virus, bringing the total figure to 575. However, Ms Sturgeon stressed a ""note of caution"" around the figures, as they only include hospital deaths where patients have recorded a positive test and there tends to be a reporting lag over the weekends. More detailed figures including deaths in care homes and other settings - and those where coronavirus is a ""suspected"" cause - will be released on Wednesday. By law, the UK's lockdown restrictions have to be reviewed every 21 days, and are set to be looked at this week. However, Ms Sturgeon said there was no prospect of them being lifted in the short term. She said: ""I want to be very clear, so nobody is under any illusions - that review is not likely to result in these restrictions being lifted in the very near future. ""There are early optimistic signs that the steps we are taking are working, but until we know more and have solid evidence, we must stick with it."" Stressing that the stringent measures remain ""essential"", the first minister added: ""They will not be in force for a single minute longer than necessary, but if we lift them too early or do so without thinking through properly how we can ease them while still keeping the virus under control, then we risk it spreading out of control, risk it overwhelming our NHS and risk it taking many more lives."" Analysis by BBC Scotland's David Henderson The traditional Easter message is one of rebirth and renewal. The message from the Scottish government, embroiled as it is in the country's biggest crisis in decades, can't be so uplifting. ""Don't delay funerals"" was the grim theme of what the interim chief medical officer had to say. Some families, it seems, may want to delay holding a service until the government lifts strict limits of how many family and friends can attend. It underlines how the virus - and the lockdown - impact on everyone's lives. The first minister made it clear there'll be a review of restrictions this week - but they're not likely to be lifted in the very near future. The key goal, she said, was saving lives. What then of an exit strategy from the lockdown? On this too, there was caution - a need to wait and see how lifting controls might work - or backfire - in other European countries. Nicola Sturgeon said the more consistency across the UK the better, when restrictions are eased. But if Scotland has to take a different approach for practical reasons, she's happy to do so. Ms Sturgeon said ""we need to understand a bit more than we do now about the impact these measures have had"" before consideration is given to lifting them. She said that ""the virus may not have gone away"", and that having repressed it there was a danger that it could start to spread again after restrictions are lifted. The first minister said that when measures are eased, the country could ""effectively go back into a contain strategy"" where the virus is kept in check via ""testing, tracing, and isolating"". Dr Smith said there was ""real interest"" in developing a new app to help trace people who may have the virus, and said it ""looks very promising"" as a way of tracking cases - although he said it would be linked to ""traditional methods of contact tracing"". Ms Sturgeon said when this happened in different parts of the UK would depend on the evidence, ""not a point of constitutional ideology either way"". She said ""simplicity of messaging"" might make it easier to maintain a ""consistent"" approach across the whole UK, but said if the evidence showed different timescales or approaches should be used in Scotland then ""we will not hesitate to do that"".","Scotland's coronavirus lockdown is not likely to be lifted ""in the very near future"", Nicola Sturgeon has said."

On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend at Mr Trump's Turnberry golf resort. The president's time in Scotland is not counted as part of the working visit. What is the difference between a working visit and a state visit? A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. A working visit - like the one Mr Trump is making - may include some of the same activities as a state visit, but there are small differences. For example, on a working visit, the visiting head of state does not address Parliament, nor is their accommodation organised and funded by the UK. Travel plans on a working visit are also organised and funded by the visiting country. What protests are planned? Tens of thousands are expected to protest against the president in London on Thursday and Friday and in Glasgow on Saturday. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission for a giant inflatable figure depicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Smaller demonstrations are also expected to be held across the UK including Devon, Dundee, Edinburgh, Belfast, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds and Liverpool. Shaista Aziz, a Labour councillor in Oxford, and one of the organisers of the Together Against Trump protest in London, said the demonstration was about saying ""very clearly that we reject the policies of this administration"". What are the security arrangements? British police have not revealed the exact number of officers required to work during Mr Trump's trip - but the Police Federation has warned the visit will put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Forces from across the country have been asked to send thousands of officers to assist with protests. The Home Office said they can be ""recompensed by the hosting force"". The Treasury has confirmed it will fund policing costs of up to Â£5m in Scotland. The National Police Chiefs' Council said discussions were ongoing about ""how the resource requirements of this massive operation will be met"" but a spokesman said: ""We are confident that forces will continue to maintain local policing services."" What about Trump supporters? Mr Trump has a number of high profile supporters in the UK - including prominent Brexiteers Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson. Speaking of Mr Johnson, who resigned as foreign secretary on Monday, Mr Trump said he was a ""friend"" and he hoped he might find time to speak to him during his visit. ""He's been very, very nice to me, very supportive,"" he said. ""I like Boris Johnson, I've always liked him."" Republicans Overseas UK are organising a rally on Friday to welcome the president while a pub in west London has been renamed The Trump Arms in honour of the visit. The US Embassy said it was looking forward to Mr Trump's arrival ""as an opportunity to highlight the vitality of the special relationship"" between the UK and US.",US President Donald Trump is set to arrive in the UK on Thursday for a two-day working visit.
"The PM attended a summit of EU leaders in Brussels before leaving while they discussed their approach to Brexit. The remaining 27 agreed that the European Commission will take the lead role in negotiations. Meanwhile Chancellor Philip Hammond has played down suggestions it could take ten years to reach a trade deal. He told the BBC: ""I don't expect that it will take as long as that,"" following reports that Britain's ambassador to the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers, suggested that others in Europe believed this could be the case. The prime minister was in Brussels on Thursday for a European Council meeting. She left the summit without answering any questions on Brexit but Irish PM Enda Kenny told reporters that she had given an update on the Supreme Court case the UK government is involved with on whether it can act alone in triggering Article 50 - the formal start of Brexit. He added: ""She would like to have the question of UK citizens living in Europe and European citizens living in the UK dealt with in the early part of discussions that take place."" A Downing St spokesman confirmed on Friday that the prime minister had raised the issue and been clear she would like to see the issue resolved as soon as possible. He said: ""We have been very clear we want to extend those rights to EU citizens here, as long as there are reciprocal arrangements for British citizens across the EU."" The question of what will happen to the estimated 2.9 million citizens of other EU countries who have made their home in the UK in recent years is one of the most controversial arising from the UK's vote to leave the EU in June's referendum. 'Misleading' The government has said it expects an early resolution of the issue once official talks on the terms of the UK's separation from the EU begin, something it plans to happen by next spring. But it has not given any guarantees on their future status - saying this is impossible without similar safeguards for the estimated 1.2 million Britons living in Spain, France, Italy and other EU countries. Mr Kenny also told reporters that the Irish Republic would not sign a bilateral trade deal with the UK and the UK had to agree its future relationship with the EU first. Pictures from the summit which circulated on social media appeared to show Mrs May looking as though she had no one to talk to. However the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said other clips showed her chatting to EU leaders while German MP Stephan Mayer said reports of the PM being frozen out were ""misleading"". Mr Mayer, who is home affairs spokesperson for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was ""reasonable"" for the 27 EU leaders to meet without Mrs May, following the formal summit, to discuss their approach to Brexit. The 27 agreed that European Commission official Michel Barnier will lead talks for the EU - although MEPs are said to want a greater say. European Council president Donald Tusk said the ""short, informal meeting"" had ""reconfirmed our principles, meaning the indivisibility of the four freedoms, the balance of rights and obligations and the rule 'no negotiations without notification'"". European Parliament president Martin Schulz has warned that negotiations could be vetoed if MEPs are not fully involved. Downing Street meanwhile has indicated that it would be possible to complete a ""divorce deal"" and a new trade agreement with the EU within the timetabled two years of the UK invoking Article 50 - the formal start of the process of leaving. But Germany's Mr Mayer said that it would be ""a bit naive"" to think a trade deal could be done in two years. ""It's very ambitious to finish these negotiations within two years, it's a huge project."" Chancellor Philip Hammond told the BBC the UK would negotiate a Brexit deal and, once that has started, would ""in parallel"" begin to negotiate new trade arrangements with the EU. Meanwhile, reports suggest that Britain could face a Â£50bn bill to leave the EU, including payments to cover pension liabilities for EU staff. Downing Street said the UK would meet its obligations while in the EU, but any financial settlement after that would be a matter for negotiation. At the summit, the leaders also discussed Syria, controlling mass migration into Europe, the EU's relationship with Ukraine, co-operation with Nato and economic matters.",Theresa May has told EU leaders that she wants an early deal in Brexit negotiations on the status of Britons in Europe and EU citizens in the UK .
"The model is believed to be one of only two right-hand drive pre-production Quattros left in existence. It is thought to be one of two 'C' chassis cars, the other being in Scotland and had been expected to fetch bids of between Â£50,000 to Â£60,000. The 1982 model went under the hammer at the Silverstone Auctions' September sale in Warwickshire earlier. Auctioneers said the car was built in June 1982, supplied through Smithfield of Digbeth, Birmingham and first registered on 1 August that year - making it ""highly likely"" to be the first factory-supplied right-hand drive UK car. Although not the same colour, it is the model used by Det Ch Insp Gene Hunt in the BBC series Ashes to Ashes, spawning his catchphrase ""Fire up the Quattro.""","A rare Audi Quattro prototype has sold for Â£49,500 at auction."
"By Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent It is a day which serves as a reminder that while the Troubles officially ended 23 years ago, historical events are still being fought out in courtrooms. The Ballymurphy families battled long and hard for this moment. The new inquest was granted back in 2011, ordered by the attorney general, who was presented with a fresh dossier of evidence. Other cases wait in the wings to start or finish. There have yet to be findings made in the inquest into the murders of 10 Protestant men by the IRA at Kingsmills in 1976. Scores of others legacy inquests will run over the next five years, many dealing with state actions from the 1970s and 1980s. In most cases, families are seeking to get at the truth or a form of closure denied to them by a police investigation and a criminal justice process. Add to that, almost 1,000 unresolved Troubles cases still in the hands of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. Two thirds of them relate to deaths caused by republican and loyalist paramilitaries. Add to that, the 250-or-so killings being independently being re-investigated by Jon Boutcher and his Operation Kenova team. There are also calls for public inquiries into the Omagh, Enniskillen and La Mon bombings, and the murder of solicitor Patrick Finucane. Co-incidentally, the Ballymurphy inquest finishes on a day when the government commits to legislation on dealing with the past. Controversially, at its heart, is an effective amnesty, ending prosecutions and instead going for an information recovery process. Decades after the conflict ended, the government wants to draw a line in the sand. But will it be one on which there is enough agreement? Will it contain an investigation process, will answers for families replace court battles, and will it ultimately help heal the past?",Today is another of those days in which the past makes itself felt in the present.
"Measuring 14ft (4.2m) from snout to tail, it hunted fish and other reptiles in warm shallow seas around Scotland during the Jurassic Period. Palaeontologists said they had given it a Gaelic name, Dearcmhara, to reflect its connection with the Hebrides. Work to identify it was led by the University of Edinburgh and museums. A team of palaeontologists studied fossil fragments of skulls, teeth, vertebrae and an upper arm bone unearthed on Skye over the past 50 years. They identified several examples of extinct aquatic animals - known as ichthyosaurs - which lived during the Early to Middle Jurassic, including the entirely new species. Dr Steve Brusatte, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, who led the study, said: ""During the time of dinosaurs, the waters of Scotland were prowled by big reptiles the size of motor boats. ""Their fossils are very rare, and only now, for the first time we've found a new species that was uniquely Scottish."" He added: ""Without the generosity of the collector who donated the bones to a museum instead of keeping them or selling them, we would have never known that this amazing animal existed."" The work was carried out by a consortium involving the University of Edinburgh, National Museums Scotland, the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum, Scottish National Heritage and Skye's Staffin Museum. Dr Nick Fraser, of National Museums Scotland, said: ""Not only is this a very special discovery, but it also marks the beginning of a major new collaboration involving some of the most eminent palaeontologists in Scotland. ""It has brought together key organisations, local collectors on Skye and specialists from further afield. We are excited by the programme of work and are already working on additional new finds."" The study is published in the Scottish Journal of Geology. The hand-beast During the Jurassic Period, much of Skye was under water and today is one of the few places in the world where fossils from the Middle Jurassic Period can be found. Other important fossil finds have been made on the Misty Isle. In 2008, scientists revealed that the earliest turtles known to live in water had been discovered on the island. The 164 million-year-old reptile fossils were found on a beach at Cladach a'Ghlinne, on the Strathaird peninsula in southern Skye. The new species formed a missing link between ancient terrestrial turtles and their modern, aquatic descendants. The fossils include more than 100 marks left by a lizard called Isochirotherium - also known as the hand-beast - 270 million years ago.",A new species of marine reptile that lived about 170 million years ago has been identified from fossils found on the Isle of Skye.
