"Several firms have answered David Hogg's call for a boycott of Laura Ingraham's show after she taunted him. In an interview this week, the 17-year-old activist said four universities had rejected his applications. The teenager has been a target of online abuse since the 14 February shooting in Parkland. Ms Ingraham tweeted about him on Wednesday: ""David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it."" David, who gave a speech at last weekend's March for Our Lives gun-control protest, later tweeted: ""Soooo @IngrahamAngle what are your biggest advertisers ... Asking for a friend. #BoycottIngramAdverts"". He later posted the names of 12 companies, encouraging his 611,000 Twitter followers to contact them. One of the firms, Nutrish, replied to his tweet, pledging to remove its commercials from Ms Ingraham's programme. Wayfair, a homeware retailer, and TripAdvisor, a travel website, also said they were pulling ads from the Fox show. A TripAdvisor spokesperson said in a statement that Ms Ingraham's comments ""cross the line of decency"". Wayfair said ""the decision of an adult to personally criticise a high school student who has lost his classmates in an unspeakable tragedy is not consistent with our values"". Nestle, the world's largest packaged food company, online streaming service Hulu, and travel website Expedia also said they planned to pull ads from the show. On Thursday, the Fox presenter struck a conciliatory tone, praising David's grades. ""On reflection, in the spirit of Holy Week, I apologize for any upset or hurt my tweet caused him or any of the brave victims of Parkland,"" she said. Ms Ingraham also invited him to appear on her show ""for a productive discussion"", saying she had previously remarked how ""poised he was given the tragedy"". Her tweet accusing him of being a whiner stemmed from an interview the teenager did with TMZ on Tuesday. David told the celebrity gossip website he had been turned away from four colleges in the University of California system. ""It's been kind of annoying having to deal with that and everything else that's been going on but at this point, you know, we're changing the world,"" he said. ""I think there's a lot of amazing people that don't get to college not only that do things like I do, but because their voices just aren't heard in the tsunami of people that apply every year for college in such an economic impacted school system which we have here in America where people have to go into massive amounts of debt just to go to college and get an education."" He also said that he has a 4.2 grade-point average (GPA) and scored a 1270 on the SAT, a key college placement exam. Both scores are considered above average. Harvey Levin, who conducted the interview for TMZ, had tweeted to Ms Ingraham that ""David was not whining"". ""He was not feeling sorry for himself in the slightest... Did you watch the video???"" he posted. On Twitter, several other users defended the teenager. ""Are you really picking on a teenager who just watched his classmates die in pools of their blood less than two months ago?"" one user wrote. David's 14-year-old sister, who was also at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when gunshots rang out, also defended her brother. ""How low are your ratings @IngrahamAngle that you have to start attacking my brother's grades to get attention?"" wrote Lauren Hogg. ""If you ask me, he is more articulate than you and has far better character. Man, that's real low even for you. Coming from a 14 year old, please grow up."" She asked First Lady Melania Trump, who has previously spoken out about online bullying, if she had any comment about her brother ""literally getting cyberbullied"". Meanwhile, the son of right-wing provocateur Alex Jones, the host of InfoWars, has challenged David Hogg to a debate. Also on Thursday, accused gunman Nikolas Cruz's brother, Zachary, was sentenced to six months probation for trespassing at the school where his brother admitted to killing 17 people in February.

"By M Ilyas KhanBBC News, Islamabad The language is no doubt typical of an increasingly partisan media in India and Pakistan these days, but many believe there is a ring of truth to it. India on Thursday announced it had carried out ""surgical strikes"" on militants' ""launching pads"" on the Pakistani side of the disputed region of Kashmir, inflicting ""significant casualties"". Viewpoint: Border 'strikes' will not trigger war Military officials told Indian media that their troops had crossed into the Pakistan-controlled side of Kashmir and carried out strikes. The announcement sent alarm bells ringing not only through the two nuclear-armed neighbours, but also the rest of the world. The so-called ""surgical strikes"" on the Pakistan-controlled side of Kashmir seemed to take the conflict to an unprecedented level - since no cross-border air or ground action has taken place in the region since the 1999 Kargil war. But what actually happened? Pakistan's military has rubbished India's claim, saying all that happened was the usual cross-border fire involving mortars and small arms in which two Pakistani soldiers were killed. Given that the Pakistani authorities have an interest in controlling the flow of ""unwanted"" information coming out of the region, the BBC sought to verify details by speaking to local contacts in areas said to have been hit by the conflict. All the areas were along the Line of Control (LoC) dividing the Indian and Pakistani controlled sides of Kashmir. A police officer in the Poonch region told the BBC's Aurangzeb Jarral that Indian artillery targeted some Pakistani military posts across the Buttal region, and two Pakistani soldiers were killed. In the Bhimber, Leepa and Neelum valley regions, several eyewitnesses reported cross-border shelling - but, crucially, none said they saw any aerial or ground incursions by Indian troops. Read more: That is not to say people weren't worried. Of all the affected areas, Neelum valley was the most tense. It is a crescent shaped, thin, long valley hemmed in by mountains on both sides - and nearly all of it is exposed to potential firing from the Indian side. The local administration ordered the schools and markets in some areas to close for the day, and traffic on the main road connecting the valley to the rest of the country was regulated - because most parts of the road lie within striking range of Indian guns. But the Indian fire did not hit either the road or the villages and towns. Instead, their fire was mostly directed at the Pakistani posts and some militant camps - especially one at Dodhanyal - where infiltration from the Pakistani side has continued in recent months, locals said. Similar camps in Leepa valley and in the Samahni area of Bhimber were also hit. But some of the camps were unmanned at the time of firing. Indian soldier arrested The only incident of border incursion by Indians was reported by locals in Goi area of Tatta Pani in Kotli region, which straddles the LoC, on Thursday afternoon, It involved a lone Indian soldier who apparently strayed into a Pakistani village and was arrested. A witness from the area told the BBC a ""panicked"" Indian soldier entered a house to seek shelter. The residents of the house informed a Pakistani post nearby who raided the house and captured the soldier. He was wearing Indian army uniform, and was carrying a shoulder bag, locals said. It is not clear why the soldier was in ""panic"" as locals did not report any border hostilities in the area. But locals say it is not the first time Indian soldiers have entered the area. While India has fenced most of the LoC, some border areas across the mountains are not fenced, and residents say Indian soldiers from a nearby post have been using water from the same spring as the local villagers. Could the conflict escalate? The view in Pakistan is that Indian PM Narendra Modi came to power on the back of his anti-Pakistan rhetoric. As a result, he is now under pressure from Hindu nationalists among his supporters who are pushing for revenge. The pressure is further increased due to an extremely competitive media landscape, where outlets vie for ratings by drumming up war hysteria, experts say. Many believe that, since both India and Pakistan have nuclear arsenals, the warmongering is just posturing to pander to Mr Modi's constituency. However some circles do point out that in the medium term, India may persist in holding Pakistan to account more than it has done in the past. These analysts expect increased hostilities along the LoC in coming weeks and months, along with aggressive diplomatic moves.","""'Surgical' farce blows up in India's face"", reads the top headline of Friday morning's Express Tribune newspaper."
"The USOC earlier said the 18-member board must step down by 31 January or lose status as a sports governing body. The USOC outlined steps the board must take after ex-USAG doctor Larry Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years for sexually abusing young athletes. Five directors of the USAG board have already resigned amid the fallout. Two Michigan State University (MSU) officials have also quit after the school became embroiled in the scandal. Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis stepped down on Friday following reports that the school knew of the abuse claims but failed to take action. He said he was ""brought to tears"" as he listened to Nassar's victims during his sentencing on Tuesday. ""My heart breaks thinking about the incomprehensible pain all of them and their families have experienced,"" he said in a statement. Nassar, 54, worked at MSU between 1997 and 2016 and served as national medical co-ordinator for USAG from 1996 to 2014. Nearly 160 women have accused him of sexual abuse. USAG has admitted dragging its feet on alerting the authorities when it learned of abuse allegations against Nassar in 2015. Multiple molestation complaints from young athletes against the physician between 1997 and 2014 were ignored by MSU. USOC CEO Scott Blackmun wrote in a letter on Thursday that USAG board directors had six days to resign and until 28 February to replace them with an interim panel. ""While the USOC encourages USAG to think and act broadly on reforming its culture, we also believe that reform must start with an entirely new board,"" Mr Blackmun wrote. He outlined six steps the sports body must take, including: In a statement on Thursday night, USAG said it ""completely embraces the requirements outlined"" in the letter and ""appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change"". Michael Burns, the head men's gymnastics coach at the University of Minnesota, became at least the fifth member to resign from USAG's board on Friday. He confirmed in an email he submitted his resignation letter on Wednesday. Both USAG and MSU deny there was a cover-up, but some victims have criticised both organisations for not doing enough to prevent the abuse. Mr Hollis' resignation from the university comes a day after the Michigan State University President Lou Anna Simon quit amid increasing calls for her resignation over the case. But it was revealed on Friday that Ms Simon can opt to return to a faculty position and take a 12-month leave of absence to conduct research, during which time she would receive her $750,000 (£529,000) salary, according to her contract, which was provided to CNN by Michigan State spokesman Jason Cody. Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who testified at Nassar's sentencing, slammed USOC in a tweet on Thursday. Also on Friday, the US House Energy and Commerce Committee announced it would launch an investigation into sexual abuse in organised sports following Nassar's case. The committee sent letters to USOC, USAG, MSU, USA Swimming, and USA Taekwondo.",The entire USA Gymnastics (USAG) board has said it will comply with a US Olympic Committee's (USOC) ultimatum to resign over an abuse scandal.
"The paper, which is often critical of the government, said it had been destroyed by the $6.3m (£4.9m) bill. Earlier on Sunday, Cambodia's opposition leader, Kem Sokha, was arrested on treason charges. He has been accused of conspiring with unnamed foreigners to harm the country. The arrest was one of a series of recent moves against political opponents and organisations deemed critical of Prime Minister Hun Sen's administration. Cambodia leader tells critics to pay up, or pack up In August, Mr Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge commander in power for more than 30 years, reportedly called the publishers of the Cambodia Daily ""thieves"" and said if the bill was not paid within 30 days the paper should ""pack up your things and leave"". In a statement confirming the closure on Sunday, the paper said: ""There may well be a legitimate dispute between the tax department and the owners of the Daily over when tax became collectable and in what amount. In an ordinary process, matters in dispute would be resolved after an audit and private negotiations. ""Instead, the Daily has been targeted with an astronomical tax assessment, leaks and false statements."" The paper, which was founded in 1993, will cease publication on Monday. The Cambodian government has previously threatened to shutter media outlets they say jeopardise ""stability"" in the country. Aside from the Cambodia Daily, other independent media outlets - including the US government-funded Radio Free Asia and Voice of America - have also reportedly been accused of not complying with tax obligations. These outlets frequently report on topics that embarrass the government, such as corruption and human rights abuses. The US State Department has said it is ""deeply concerned by the deterioration in Cambodia's democratic climate"" in recent weeks. But the Cambodian government denies the cases are political, saying critical journalists have considerable freedoms in the country.","One of Cambodia's last independent newspapers, the Cambodia Daily, has announced it will close after the government ordered it to pay a huge tax bill."
"Caroline WyattFormer religious affairs correspondent@CarolineWyatton Twitter Its significance for both Churches is immense. Whatever the joint declaration they sign when they meet in Cuba on Friday, the simple fact of their meeting is a clear signal the hostility and chill of the past thousand years or so since the Great Schism may finally be edging towards a warmer phase in relations. That relationship with the Russian Orthodox Church matters because about two-thirds of the world's more than 200 million Orthodox Christians are Russian. Earlier popes tried to pave the way for such a thaw with Moscow, most notably Pope Saint John Paul II, who tried to reach out to the Russian Orthodox Church. However, those efforts were hindered by post-Cold War suspicion - above all in Moscow - which was only added to by the Pope's own Slavic roots. This ""personal conversation"" between the two leaders at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana has been made possible by many relatively recent geopolitical shifts. 'Ecumenism of blood' One of the main drivers of this meeting was the realisation over the past few years that when Christians are persecuted or driven out of their homes in the Middle East and Africa, their killers are not interested in which Christian denomination they come from. It is what Pope Francis has termed the ""ecumenism of blood"", and the Pope, the Russian president and the Russian patriarch regard what is happening to Christians in Syria and Iraq as genocide. The Pope's own heritage as the world's first Latin American pope, allied to his recent diplomatic efforts in Cuba, Moscow and elsewhere, may also have been one of the factors helping to nudge the Orthodox Church towards agreeing to the meeting. Pope Francis is seen in Moscow as a leader who does not necessarily instinctively agree with the US, despite his warm reception there last year, and whose instincts incline towards dialogue rather than confrontation. Some in Russia still worry about the Western Church's influence in Ukraine in particular, where the Greek Catholic Church is viewed with hostility by many Russian Orthodox. They see it as encroaching on Moscow's canonical turf, and taking a mostly anti-Russian political stance. Under the leadership of Josef Stalin, the Soviet Union handed over Eastern Catholic churches to the Orthodox Church. But following the collapse of Communism, the Catholics took back some 500 churches, mainly in Western Ukraine in the 1980s and 1990s, to the bitter dismay of the Orthodox. Likewise, post-Soviet Russia worried about Catholics trying to win over the Orthodox faithful in its sphere of influence after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a period when missionaries from many denominations headed east to win converts - although very few Orthodox actually converted to Catholicism. However, Russia's Orthodox Patriarch Kirill has also made warmer overtures over the past few years than his predecessors. He is much closer to the Kremlin than previous patriarchs. It's thought that he would have been unlikely to have agreed to the meeting with Pope Francis without some kind of tacit acceptance of the move from President Vladimir Putin, who has visited the Vatican and met several popes during his years in power. Moscow may also be keen to reassert its relevance on the global religious stage, as well as in secular foreign affairs, after its decades of official Soviet atheism. Now that the Vatican is again proving itself a diplomatic force to be reckoned with, Russia is perhaps keen to keep the Vatican onside. It is proving a useful interlocutor between East and West on issues ranging from the war in Syria to the protection of Christians across the Middle East, while the Vatican is also a potential theological ally in the question of how to deal with the global threat from radical Islamism. All this does not mean that the Great Schism or East-West Schism of 1054 is yet at an end, nor that Christian unity is nigh, but respectful dialogue is likely to be the order of the day in Cuba. No Pope has ever visited Russia. So perhaps this meeting in Cuba might just pave the way for yet another first for a papacy that continues to be full of surprises. Who are the Orthodox? The Orthodox Church is one of the three main Christian groupings, alongside Roman Catholics and Protestants. It is made up of Churches that are either autocephalous (meaning having their own head) or autonomous (meaning self-governing). The word ""Orthodox"" comes from the Greek words ""orthos"" (correct) and ""doxa"" (belief). The Orthodox Churches are united in faith and by a common approach to theology, tradition, and worship. They draw on elements of Greek, Middle-Eastern, Russian and Slavic culture. The Orthodox tradition developed from the Christianity of the Eastern Roman Empire and was shaped by the pressures, politics and peoples of that geographical area. Since the Eastern capital of the Roman Empire was Byzantium, this style of Christianity is sometimes called Byzantine Christianity. The Orthodox Churches share with the other Christian Churches the belief that God revealed himself in Jesus Christ, and a belief in the incarnation of Christ, his crucifixion and resurrection. But they differ substantially from the other Churches in the way of life and worship, and in certain aspects of theology.

"It was the biggest rally since regular demonstrations against the centre-right cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor Orban began in April. Many were dressed as clowns, after Mr Orban's alleged pledge to send his ""clown affairs secretary"" to negotiate. The government argues that the reforms are needed to cut spending. 'Clown revolution' Policemen, firemen and soldiers were at the forefront of the demonstrations across Hungary on Thursday. In Budapest, more than 10,000 walked from parliament to the presidential palace. Early retirement for public sector workers was one of the benefits introduced by the Socialist-led government in the 1990s to compensate for low wages, the BBC's Nick Thorpe in Budapest reports. But protesters are now particularly angry that the Mr Orban's government has abolished their retirement rights retroactively, our correspondent adds. The government says it will no longer pay pensions to people younger than the general retirement aged of 65. The reform is affecting policemen and members of the armed forces, who until now have had the right to retire at 45. ""I worked as a policeman all my life and for 25 years I thought I could retire,"" Attila Bogdan, 49, was quoted as saying by Reuters. ""Now I feel like someone who had been cheated on by his wife when he became a grandfather,"" he added. Many protesters sported painted faces and clowns' noses after Mr Orban's alleged remark. Some in the crowd even dubbed their demonstration a ""clown revolution"". Mr Orban's cabinet says the reforms are necessary to cut spiralling spending and also boost low employment rates.","Thousands of people in Hungary have protested against austerity measures introduced by the government, including cuts in early retirement benefits."
"KCNA news agency said the ""intensive and persistent"" attacks coincided with US-South Korea military drills. Official sites such as KCNA, Air Koryo and Rodong Sinmun, the party newspaper, are reported to have been inaccessible on some occasions in recent days. Tension has escalated in the wake of North Korea's third nuclear test last month. The test led to fresh UN sanctions being imposed on Pyongyang, which has responded with strong rhetoric - both to the UN move and the annual joint drills, which it bitterly opposes. It says it has scrapped the Korean War armistice and ended non-aggression pacts with Seoul. It has also cut off a hotline that connects the two countries. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice, not a treaty. South Korea says North Korea cannot unilaterally dissolve the armistice and has called on Pyongyang to tone down its language. North Korea called the cyber attack a ""cowardly and despicable act"". ""It is nobody's secret that the US and South Korean puppet regime are massively bolstering up cyber forces in a bid to intensify the subversive activities and sabotages against the DPRK [North Korea],"" KCNA said. Accusations of cyber attacks on the peninsula usually flow in the opposite direction, says the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul. South Korean intelligence sources say North Korea routinely attempts to access the network here, and Pyongyang is believed to have broken into Defence Ministry data at least once in the past few years, our correspondent adds. The cause of the disruption remains unclear. Current internet access in North Korea is extremely limited for locals, with most people only having access to a small number of state-run pages. The wider internet is available only to the government and the military.","North Korea has accused the US and its allies of attacks on its internet servers, amid tension on the peninsula."
"Senator Sir Philip Bailhache said the States of Jersey had proven time and again that it could not decide on its own make-up. After a two-day debate, politicians agreed to hold a referendum on reform in April. The debate saw five amendments put forward and rejected. 'Go and vote' Senator Bailhache, who previously served as Bailiff which includes being speaker of the States, said it was time islanders had their say. He said: ""This is an issue which the debate over the last two days has shown, the States are completely incapable of resolving. ""They need the help of the people, so if you care about Jersey, if you care about the way in which the island is governed and the quality of the government and its responsiveness to the people, then you need to go out and vote."" Senator Francis Le Gresley said it was important States members had their say. He said: ""There is a clash here between the [Privileges and Procedures Committee] who have not done what was set out in the terms of reference, there was an arrogance that States members would roll over and say: 'This is fantastic and get this voted in'. ""We are here because we were elected by the people of Jersey to make decisions. We want to have a decision on what should be in the referendum, we are not going to just accept that this is right."" The referendum will be held on 24 April and the ballot paper will have three options covering the number or politicians and size of constituency. The debate included five amendments looking to change the wording of the ballot paper and an attempt to make the electoral commission look again.","Jersey's government is incapable of reforming itself, according to the chairman of the electoral commission."
"He told the House of Commons it was ""one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made"". Mr Scheer said he would stay on in his role until the party chooses a new leader. He only became leader in May 2017 in a razor thin victory against 12 rivals. Mr Trudeau thanked Mr Scheer for ""his dedication and service"" and said he understood the many sacrifices made by the families of politicians. ""I wish him all the very, very best in his next steps."" Why is he resigning? Making the announcement on Thursday, Mr Scheer, 40, spoke about the sacrifices made by his family for his political career. The decision to resign was not made lightly, he said. ""But in order to chart the course ahead, this party, this movement needs someone who can give 100 per cent to the efforts. ""And after some conversations with my kids and my wife and loved ones, I felt it was time to put my family first."" He said the strain of an election had taken a toll on five children and wife, Jill, whom he called ""heroic"". Mr Scheer has served in federal politics since 2004 since being elected to the House of Commons at age 25. Is private school tuition anything to do with it? Mr Scheer's resignation came amid revelations, first reported by Global News, that the Conservative Party had helped cover the cost of private school for the Conservative leader's children. Conservative Party Executive Director Dustin van Vugt said in a statement the party had offered to reimburse some of the costs associated with being party leader and relocating Mr Scheer's family to Canada's capital, ""as is the normal practice for political parties"". ""Shortly after Mr Scheer was elected leader,"" Mr van Vugt said, ""we had a meeting where I made a standard offer to cover costs associated with moving his family from Regina to Ottawa. ""This includes a differential in schooling costs between Regina and Ottawa. All proper procedures were followed and signed off on by the appropriate people."" Mr van Vught's office insisted that Mr Scheer's resignation was not related to the reimbursements. News of the tuition assistance divided Conservatives. Many defended Mr Scheer, while others decried the funding as inappropriate. ""There's nothing proper or appropriate about having party members' money used to pay for someone's children's private school education,"" Conservative strategist Kory Teneycke told the Globe and Mail newspaper. ""There's nothing normal about that."" Final nail in the coffin Analysis by Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Toronto Although the precise timing of Mr Scheer's departure may come as a surprise to many, few could say that they expected him to hold on to power for much longer. Mr Scheer has been struggling to rally the party behind him since the October election. Although he vowed to stay on and fight, the voices clamouring for his removal had been growing louder. Several party members had mounted a public campaign for his ousting, while a veteran MP who had served under Stephen Harper declined a position in Mr Scheer's shadow cabinet. News that the party had been partly paying for his children's private school did not go over well with the base, who favour small-government and fiscal frugality. It proved to be the final nail in the coffin. How did Scheer do? In October's election, Mr Scheer led his Conservatives to a 22-seat bump in the House of Commons and edged out the Liberals in the popular vote. Just days before the election, some polls projected the Conservatives would win the most seats. But the leader remained dogged by questions about his position on issues such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage, which are popular in Canada. Critics of Mr Scheer say he failed to capitalise on the prime minister's stumbles while in office and on the trail, namely the SNC-Lavalin scandal, and pictures that emerged of Mr Trudeau in blackface. Still, the party picked up seats in New Brunswick, Ontario and British Columbia and swept the prairies, leaving Mr Trudeau without any party members from Canada's oil-producing provinces Alberta and Saskatchewan. What's next for the party? Mr Scheer will remain on as a member of Parliament. He said the Conservative Party will now begin steps towards electing a new leader. Many had expected Mr Scheer to hang on as leader at least until Conservatives gather in Toronto for their biennial convention next April. On Thursday, Mr Scheer called for party unity and vowed the next leader would have his full support. ""The party that we've all built together is far too important for one individual. ""Our party is not a cult of personality, it's not shaped by whoever's name is on the masthead but by the hundreds of thousands of Conservatives who pound in lawn signs, sit on their riding associations and donate a few dollars every month.""",Canada's Conservative leader Andrew Scheer is stepping down after facing criticism for failing to oust Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in October's election.
"Seventy people have been injured, a spokesman for the local fire brigade has told the BBC. Firefighters have now entered the building after the fire was brought under control. The death toll may rise further, as dozens are feared trapped inside the 19-storey office block in Banani. They are believed to have been situated on the upper floors of the building, above where the fire broke out. Local media said people were seen shouting for help from windows and at least six people jumped out of the burning building. Fire crews, backed by members of the navy and air force, were called to the scene to tackle the blaze. Dozens of people have been rescued. ""Nineteen fire-fighting units are working at the scene. Bangladesh navy and air force have also joined to fight the fire,"" duty officer Mohammad Russel from Dhaka's central fire service control room is quoted as saying by AFP news agency. Air force helicopters were seen rescuing people from the rooftop. Helicopters also dropped water on the burning building from above while hundreds of panicked relatives and friends gathered outside the building. Large fires are relatively common in Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor building conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. Last month, a massive blaze in Dhaka's old quarter killed at least 78 people and injured dozens more. That same month, a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagong killed at least nine people. Dhaka, with a population of more than 18 million, is one of the world's most densely populated cities. Some 3.5 million of its people live in slums, according to the World Bank.","At least 19 people have been killed in a huge blaze in a high-rise building in an upmarket commercial area of the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka."

"Soutik BiswasDelhi correspondent Many believe the government whipped up needless nationalist hysteria by sending the police into the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and arresting students under India's discredited colonial-era sedition laws. It levelled allegations against the students on the basis of an allegedly doctored video and a fake tweet. An unapologetic commissioner of police actually asked the students to prove their innocence. As if this was not enough, Mr Modi maintained a baffling silence over the shameful attack on students and journalists by party-backed lawyers inside and outside a court. A lot of this violence happened within a mile of Mr Modi's office and his home ministry office. Elsewhere, journalists and lawyers working in the Maoist-affected areas of BJP-ruled Chhattisgarh state were forced to pack up and leave, allegedly under pressure from the authorities. At the well-known Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), BJP supporters kicked up a storm over beef being allegedly served in the college canteen, a charge that the university denied. And 19 people died in violent caste riots in BJP-ruled Haryana. 'Assault on free speech' Mr Modi's peace initiative with Pakistan - he paid a surprise visit to his counterpart Nawaz Sharif in December - appeared to be in tatters after militants stormed an institute in Kashmir. Talks between the two countries have stalled anyway after last month's attack on an air force base near the Pakistan border. Mr Modi has promised growth and jobs, and last year India outpaced China in terms of economic growth, though some analysts say India still doesn't 'feel' like a 7% economy. But what has rankled most are the campus arrests. Critics have condemned them as an assault on the freedom of expression. Yet government ministers have refused to back down, vowing to punish what they describe as ""anti-national elements"". Commentators have described the student arrests as a ""national embarrassment"" and a ""self-goal"" for Mr Modi's government. A columnist wrote that sending the police after the students was like ""swinging a battle-axe to crack a nut"". The government, said another analyst, was ""seeking out conflict"" rather than resolving it. The New York Times wrote trenchantly that Mr Modi and his political allies were ""determined to silence dissent"". Rights watchdog Amnesty International, never a friend of Mr Modi, has joined in, blaming his government for contributing to a climate of growing intolerance for dissent. Mr Modi has so far preferred to remain silent - even on his favoured Twitter - about the rising frenzy over nationalism being stoked by his party. Inflection point Much like former prime minister Indira Gandhi, who used to blame the ""foreign hand"" for her government's travails in the last few years of her reign, Mr Modi, who secured one of the biggest mandates in India's history last May, said recently that conspiracies were being hatched to destabilise his government. ""I find his behaviour increasingly odd,"" historian Ramachandra Guha told the Financial Times. It is not clear whether the last week could turn out to be an inflection point in the history of Mr Modi's government. A week of mass protests in Delhi in December 2012 following the death of a woman who was gang-raped turned out to be such a turning point for the last government. By the time Mr Modi's taciturn predecessor Manmohan Singh appealed for calm, his Congress party had completely lost the battle of perception. On the eve of its second anniversary, Mr Modi's government, according to one commentator, could well have already sown the seeds of defeat. But such pronouncements may well be premature. A recent opinion poll showed that although his popularity is fading, Mr Modi remains twice as popular as his rival Rahul Gandhi of the main opposition Congress. Mr Gandhi's feeble party and the regional opposition still remain, according to many, Mr Modi's greatest advantage. Also, some believe that the current climate of confrontation actually helps Mr Modi and his Hindu nationalist party. ""This helps the BJP to move to the plank of ultra-nationalism. They are saying that India is threatened by anti-nationals, people who don't agree with us or vote for us,"" says Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, who has written a biography of Mr Modi. 'Bad for democracy' ""In one stroke everyone ranging from liberals to social democrats, parliamentary communists to ultra-leftists have been clubbed together as being anti-nationals. They are saying everybody has ganged up against this nationalist government."" Sudipta Kaviraj of Columbia University has written that India's economic growth may have led to rising nationalism among a section of its people. Dr Kaviraj says six decades of economic growth have produced a ""relatively large and economically powerful and politically assertive modern professional middle class who support a strong nation state as a precondition for further economic growth"". A substantial section of this urban middle-class continues to back Mr Modi for his muscular nationalism. It is not clear, however, whether the idea of a less pluralist Hindu nationalist state is finding any buyers beyond a few northern and western Indian states. More importantly, India's villages end up deciding the fate of its governments. Two years of drought, crop failures and declining rural incomes have left many farmers frustrated with Mr Modi's government. Triumphal nationalism may not be enough to stir them into voting for him. Also, as Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay says, nationalism is always a dangerous gamble. ""It sends out the signal that you want to remake India. It is bad for the health of our democracy and it is bad for India's image.""","A week is a long time in politics, and what happened in India last week has not exactly covered Narendra Modi's government in glory."
"Herd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease through vaccinations or through the mass spread of a disease. Some have argued that coronavirus should be allowed to spread naturally in the absence of a vaccine. But WHO chief Tedros Ghebreyesus said such an approach was ""scientifically and ethically problematic"". There have been more than 37 million confirmed cases of coronavirus across the globe since the pandemic began. More than one million people are known to have died. While hundreds of vaccines are currently under development, with a number in advanced trials, none has yet received international approval. Speaking at a news conference on Monday, Dr Tedros argued that the long-term impacts of coronavirus - as well as the strength and duration any immune response - remained unknown. ""Herd immunity is achieved by protecting people from a virus, not by exposing them to it,"" he said. ""Never in the history of public health has herd immunity been used as a strategy for responding to an outbreak, let alone a pandemic."" The WHO head added that seroprevalence tests - where the blood is tested for antibodies - suggested that just 10% of people had been exposed to coronavirus in most countries. ""Letting Covid-19 circulate unchecked therefore means allowing unnecessary infections, suffering and death,"" he said.",The head of the World Health Organization has ruled out a herd immunity response to the pandemic.
"He will still face charges of drugs possession and making threats to kill. The U-turn by authorities, announced less than 24 hours after Mr Rudd appeared in court, was because of a lack of evidence, his lawyer said. Paul Mabey said the charge should never have been laid, and that his client was considering ""any possible remedies"". He added that Mr Rudd had suffered ""incalculable"" damage from the publicity surrounding the allegation and its sensational reporting. Mr Mabey described the drug charges as ""minor"" offences and said the musician would defend the charge of making threats to kill, which carries a maximum sentence of seven years in jail. AC/DC had earlier issued a statement saying its planned tour would not be affected by news of the charges. The band is one of the highest grossing music acts of all time. 'Family man, not hit man' On Thursday, the 60-year-old musician appeared in court after a police raid on his waterfront house in Tauranga, on New Zealand's North Island. He was released on bail and told he must not contact anyone involved in the alleged murder plot. But on Friday, prosecuting lawyer Greg Hollister-Jones said his office had reviewed the case and found there was ""insufficient evidence to proceed with the charge of attempting to procure murder"". The initial charge of attempting to procure murder was made by police, but after Mr Rudd's court appearance, Crown prosecutors took on the case. Local media reports said at the time that the alleged plot targeted two men. The judge ruled that their names as well as that of the alleged hit-man could not be revealed. The man allegedly named in court papers as the ""intended hitman"" told The New Zealand Herald newspaper he believed the matter had been blown out of proportion. Describing himself as a ""family man"", not a hitman, he said the charges against Mr Rudd - whom he considered a friend - were simply ""hot air"". However, the man refused to blame police, who he said were just doing their job. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says the episode will prove embarrassing for the New Zealand police. Mr Rudd, who has lived in New Zealand for over two decades, is next due in court on 27 November. AC/DC launches its new album on 2 December. The drummer was kicked out of the band in 1983 and rejoined in 1994. But his absence from a recent photo of band members prompted online speculation about whether he was still in the band.

"Video showed several people being freed from a secret room hidden behind heavy trolleys piled high with clothes. A father and two sons who ran the business in the south-eastern province of Murcia have been arrested. Police said the business sourced and distributed clothing to African countries for sale. In a statement (in Spanish), authorities said the migrants had been forced to work long days in poor conditions and were paid only two euros (£1.80; $2.40) per hour. When officers raided the business in Fuente Álamo, the manager began to shout at his workers to run and hide, the statement said. Four of them jumped an outer fence while others locked themselves in the warehouse. When officers gained entry they found eight workers had been placed inside a ""den"" that was hidden behind heavy trolleys full of clothing. They said the secret room had been built to hide people in the event of police intervention. ""The detainees recruited foreign citizens in an irregular situation to force them to work without any legal guarantee during long hours,"" police said. ""They took advantage of their vulnerability, and their situation of need, to subject them to harsh working conditions.""

"Strike action was averted two weeks ago when the company delayed introducing changes to working conditions. Bob Lanning, of the Unite union, said the company had agreed to hold regular meetings with staff to hopefully avoid a similar problem in the future. CT Plus would not comment except to confirm the meeting took place. The reduction in the number of four-day weekends and signing in and out times had raised concerns among the drivers. Mr Lanning said: ""You're reliant on importing people to run these services for you and when you're importing people you have to take that into consideration. ""One of the major problems was four-day weekends, these people need to go home to see their families, they come here to earn money... so you need to make sure you're treating them right.""

Police issued a warning after a video - widely shared on social media - showed several spectators at the TT races ""wandering"" around on the closed roads.

"Pastor Bao Guohua, his wife and five church employees were detained in Jinhua, in eastern Zhejiang province. But the church's lawyer Chen Jiangang told the BBC he believed they were being punished for protesting against the removal of their church cross. The local government in Zhejiang has recently been ordering state-sanctioned churches to stop displaying crosses. A number of churches have also been demolished after the government said they broke building regulations. Christians have said the crackdown is an attempt to rein in the influence of Christianity. China blog: China cracks down on Hong Kong evangelists Chinese state media on Wednesday said that Mr Bao and his wife, Xing Wenxiang, who are pastors at the Holy Love Christian Church, had embezzled hundreds of thousands of yuan in church funds and ""conducted illegal business"". They are also accused of ""deliberately hiding accounts, and on several occasions distorting the truth to incite social unrest among believers,"" according to a widely reproduced report by Zhejiang Daily newspaper. But lawyer Mr Chen told the BBC that their arrest was an act of retaliation by authorities. He said a local religious affairs official told the church in June to take down their cross, and the church refused. ""I can tell you that if church leaders had agreed to take down the cross, there would have been no problem. But they refused. That's why they were detained,"" he said. ""What is unusual is that this was an official church, recognised by the Communist Party. Everything had been properly approved by the authorities,"" he says adding that the church gained approval in 2008. China is officially atheist but constitutionally guarantees religious freedom. But churches, which have flourished in particular in the country's southeast, have to be approved by the state.",Seven Christians have been detained in China accused of embezzlement and disrupting social order.
"By Yuwen WuBBC Chinese Xu Huaiqian, 44, was editor-in-chief for the Dadi (Earth) supplement of the People's Daily. According to its official microblog, he jumped to his death on 22 August. The official People's Daily microblog said he had taken time off because of depression and had sought medical help. Xu Huaiqian was born in 1968 and graduated from the prestigious Peking University in 1989. After a year of work experience in a steel plant, he started working for People's Daily, where he stayed until his death. 'Can't leave system' Zhu Tieszhi, deputy chief editor of Seeking Truth journal, said he could not believe that Mr Xu had chosen this route. Many people praised his excellent writing, and quotes from his interviews and publications have become instant hits. In an interview he gave before his death, Xu Huaiqian was quoted as saying: ""My pain is I dare to think, but I don't dare to speak out; if I dare to speak out, I don't dare to write it down, and if I dare to write it down, there is no place to publish. ""I admire those freelance writers, but I can't leave the system because if I do that my family will suffer."" In an article entitled ""Let Death Be the Witness"", he also wrote: ""Death is a heavy word, but in China, in many cases, without deaths society will not sit up and pay attention, and problems won't be resolved."" These quotes were widely circulated on the internet and resonated with netizens who expressed shock and anger as they asked why a talented journalist ended up taking his own life. 'Unpublished script' A reader posted in Tencent Weibo (one of China's Twitter equivalents): ""I am only starting my career as a journalist and I have encountered such difficulties in my work already, and I feel that I can't fight them."" A reader asked on Sina Weibo: ""Did Xu Huaiqian die to serve as a witness? Was it personal depression or the depression of an era? What kind of country is this?"" Another netizen commented that Mr Xu experienced the 1989 student movement as a young man but he had to live in lies, which caused his illness. Some netizens mentioned the fact Mr Xu's suicide happened just days after the Burmese government said it was lifting its censorship, and lamented the sad state of affairs for Chinese intellectuals and journalists. An eulogy posted on QQ Weibo by Gao Shixian summed up like this: ""People are the editors of a country; People only have their lives to publish; Their life is their article, and their death is the payment; Your sad end to life is like an unpublished script.""",The suicide of a senior editor working for China's Communist Party newspaper has sparked strong reaction from Chinese cultural and media circles and on the internet.
"By Owen AmosBBC News, Washington DC Bill Ashley is 79, but still remembers his first geography lesson. He was in fourth grade in 1940s North Carolina. Most of the pupils were ""bored or asleep"". Bill was different. ""I sat there, so excited,"" he says. ""I wanted to visit those places."" It was easier said than done. Bill's family was poor. They lived on a tobacco farm, in a small house with no electricity. Water came from a nearby spring. When he said he wanted to go to college, his parents said they couldn't afford it. Thanks to a scholarship - and a summer job picking tobacco - he made it. Bill became a teacher and, in the summer of 1962, finally went abroad. It was 15 years since that geography lesson. The trip - paid for with a $600 bank loan - took him across Europe, from London to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Since then, he has been to almost every country in the world. Bill caught the travel bug in a North Carolina classroom. Seventy years later, there's no sign of a cure. To join the Travelers' Century Club (a non-profit group) you must have been to at least 100 countries or territories. Bill has been to 259 of the 325 places on the TCC list. His highlights include Table Mountain, balloon rides over Kenya, and being at ""18,000ft over Kashmir"". It's an incredible feat for a retired teacher. ""It's where your priorities are,"" he says. ""Some people have to get a car every two years. I just got rid of mine April, and it was 34 years old. ""I save my money to travel. I don't have to go to Starbucks every morning and have a $4 cup of coffee."" Next year he's going to the North Pole; before then he's heading to Colombia. Territory 260 is likely to be San Andres and Providencia, a Colombian archipelago in the Caribbean. ""My friend and I are going to fly up there from Cartagena so I can check it off,"" he says. So does he keep travelling to see new places? Or to tick things off a list? ""It's a little bit of both,"" he admits. The TCC says some people join the club for ""bragging rights"", but its slogan is more noble: ""World travel: the passport to peace through understanding."" Bill is sure that travel has global benefits, as well as personal. ""The whole thing is to try to feel like you're leaving the world in a better place than you found it,"" he says. To finish the TCC list, you have to visit places that are remote, or dangerous, or both. Terry Wharton is a 79-year-old from Derbyshire, England, who has lived in the US since 1963. He has been to 312 places, including Afghanistan (five years ago) and Iraq (seven years ago). ""It was triple security to get into the hotel in Kabul - it's where the journalists stay,"" he says. ""My girlfriend took photos as we went through. The security went bananas."" Terry and his partner were able to walk freely round Kabul, but in Iraq their group of four needed protection. ""We had a driver, a guard, and a bodyguard - and he was packing heat [carrying guns],"" he says. Their trip included Baghdad (""the Minister of the Interior took a personal interest - they opened a museum for a special visit"") and Kurdistan (""super safe - we walked round there""). They also went south to Basra, where British troops were based after the 2003 invasion. ""That was probably the least safe area,"" says Terry. ""We travelled in a van - they drew the drapes when we got into occupied areas."" It sounds exciting, but also - shall we say - a touch scary. ""It was wonderful,"" replies Terry. ""I trust the company who organised the trip. They know a lot of detail."" The 13 places left on Terry's list include Fernando de Noronha, an archipelago 220 miles off the coast of Brazil, the Juan Fernandez Islands, 400 miles off Chile, and the British Indian Ocean Territory. Sadly for Terry, unless you're in the military, the BIOT - a base for American forces - is almost impossible to reach. There are stories of travellers hiring yachts, sailing nearby, then calling a fake SOS to get taken ashore. ""I met a guy in South Sudan - we were there when it first became a country,"" remembers Terry. ""He was really upset when I said I was from England: 'You bastards!' ""His last place (on the list) was Diego Garcia (the main island in the BIOT)."" Terry doesn't know whether he'll finish the 325 - not least because he's having both knees replaced two days after this interview - but his eyes dance at the possibility. ""When I'm doing new countries, I get a real thrill,"" he says. ""I think: 'I made it'."" The TCC list: Some of the remotest places The Travelers' Century Club has members all over the world, with chapters (branches) in the US, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. The Washington DC chapter meets in the back room of a restaurant in nearby Virginia. More than 20 members turn up to swap stories, share tips, and see friends old and new. Listening to the chatter is like leafing through an atlas - a Lord Howe Island here; a Queen Maud Land there. Jorie Roberts, a 62-year-old tax lawyer from the US Virgin Islands, has been to 157 places on the TCC list. She grew up in Alabama and, like Bill Ashley, didn't travel abroad as a child. When she was 17, a teacher led a summer trip to Europe - London, Dijon, Geneva, Rome - and she has ""travelled ever since"". Like many members , Jorie disproves the ""box-ticking"" theory by revisiting favourite places. She has, for example, been to Iran twice and Cuba four times. ""We met a photographer who lived with Che and Fidel in the late 50s in the mountains,"" she says. ""He had all sorts of pictures of them in hammocks with cigars. It was fascinating."" For Scott Talan, another TCC member, finding places he likes is the whole point. ""Before I knew about the Travelers' Century Club, my real thinking was 'go to enough places, find the ones you really like, that move you, that you want to return to',"" he says. ""For example, Kyoto (in Japan) - I've already been there four times. I went to Laos, Luang Prabang, and didn't check my watch for four days. I want to go back there."" Scott was the mayor of a town in California aged 30, became a television journalist, and is now an assistant professor at American University in Washington DC. ""I learn about people and places [through travel],"" he says. ""When a student from, say, Indonesia is in my class, and I can say I've been there, there's an immediate connection."" Jeffrey Houle, a partner with law firm DLA Piper, is the area co-ordinator for the DC branch. He has been to 151 places on the TCC list, covering every continent bar Antarctica. ""Making the world a better place is all about making connections,"" the 52-year-old says. ""We're all human beings - the more connections you make across cultures, across countries, across continents, that builds understanding."" As the meeting ends, Jeffrey hands out copies of interesting articles. Some are about air miles; others are about hard-to-reach places. One of them is about Elon Musk's plans for space travel. Bill Ashley smiles and takes a copy. For now, package holidays to the Moon seem unlikely. But so, in a classroom in 1940s North Carolina, did Bill's chances of seeing every corner of the Earth.",The Travelers' Century Club is home to the world's most-travelled people - so what keeps them going?
"Arvind Kejriwal said his party would fight against the culture of ""bribe-taking"" and pledged to contest the next general elections due in 2014. The launch of the party comes on a day when India is observing Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary. Last month, anti-corruption campaigner Anna Hazare parted ways with Mr Kejriwal over plans to enter politics. Mr Hazare has said he prefers ""sacred"" agitation over politics, ""which is full of dirt"". Mr Kejriwal has said his group would continue to ""seek Mr Hazare's blessings"" despite the rift. 'Party of the people' ""The country is being sold and all parties are guilty. We need to clean up the system,"" Mr Kejriwal told his supporters at the launch of the party in the capital, Delhi, on Tuesday. ""This is not my party. This is a party of the people of this country. ""I do not know whether we will win or lose, but if I do not fight today my children will accuse me of wasting an opportunity,"" he said. Mr Kejriwal said they would announce the name of their party on 26 November. Correspondents say the new party aims to tap into the public anger against several high-profile corruption scandals which have come to light in the last few months. Mr Kejriwal is a former bureaucrat who won the Ramon Magsaysay award in 2006 for social work and initiatives to fight corruption. Two years ago, the 44-year-old campaigner set up a group called India Against Corruption aimed at putting pressure on the government to bring about tough anti-corruption laws. Mr Hazare led the movement through a series of hunger strikes and protests. The two campaigners met in Delhi ahead of Tuesday's announcement and Mr Kejriwal said: ""We have no fight between us. He himself has said the goal is [the] same though the paths are different."" Both the campaigners are demanding the appointment of an independent ombudsman to prosecute politicians and civil servants suspected of corruption. The idea was passed by the lower house of parliament in the form of the Lokpal bill in December 2011. But the upper house adjourned amid chaos without passing the controversial legislation. A 12-day fast by Mr Hazare a year ago almost brought the government to its knees and led to the introduction of the Lokpal bill in parliament. Mr Hazare started another hunger strike in December but called it off and threatened instead to launch a campaign of civil disobedience that would fill the country's jails.",A leading campaigner in India has announced the establishment of a political party to fight corruption.
"Corby, 36, was convicted of drug smuggling in 2005 after 4.1kg (9lb) of marijuana was found in her bag at Denpasar airport in Bali in 2004. The former beauty student has always maintained her innocence. Her case has attracted intense interest in Australia, with prolonged public debate over her guilt or innocence. It also led to criticism of what was perceived by some as a tough 20-year prison sentence. Corby was granted parole after receiving a series of cuts to her sentence for good behaviour and a five-year reduction granted by the Indonesian president after an appeal for clemency. She must serve out her parole period in Bali. She is expected to live with her sister, Mercedes, on the Indonesian island. The announcement came in a press conference by Indonesian Justice and Human Rights Minister Amir Syamsuddin. ""After our review, we have approved 1,291 applications, there will be more. Corby is included in the 1,291 cases,"" he said. ""The implementation [of the release] will be carried out by the local authorities."" He added that he did not ""want to talk specifically about Schapelle"" and said that she had not been given special treatment. ""Parole is not a matter of policy and not a minister's generosity. It's the right of inmates. We're a dignified country and we uphold the laws,"" he said. Media frenzy The minister refused to go into the specifics on when Corby would be released, the BBC's Alice Budisatrijo in Jakarta reports. A prison governor said Corby could be released as early as Monday afternoon, once the correct paperwork was received, Australian broadcaster ABC reported. Corby's mental health is said to have deteriorated while in jail. Her case has generated intense media interest, with large numbers of Australian media gathered outside Kerobokan prison in Bali, where Corby has been held. According to reports, Australian media are competing to pay for Corby's story following her release. Reports say Corby will not be able to leave for Australia until 2017. She is required to stay in Indonesia for an extra year, after her sentence ends in 2016, to comply with her parole conditions. Some Indonesian MPs had spoken out against Corby's early release on Thursday. They said it would be inconsistent with Jakarta's attempts to crack down on the drug trade.","Convicted Australian drug trafficker Schapelle Corby has been granted parole after serving nine years in prison, Indonesia has announced."
"But if you follow the news, you might have noticed an abundance of stories about ""serial poopers"": people who brazenly defecate in public, leaving shock (and, well, turds) in their wake. The latest case involves a businessman from Brisbane, Australia, who has been charged with creating a public nuisance after reportedly fouling the same private path up to 30 times. Are tales like these down to unfortunate medical conditions? Or is public pooing an extreme act of rebellion? We asked a psychologist and an anger management expert what drives people to drop their pants in public... 'Soft or hard?' Professor Mike Berry, a clinical forensic psychologist at Birmingham City University, says rage, anxiety, a desire to send a message, alcohol or illness could all be responsible. ""It's interesting,"" he says. ""I've worked on cases where burglars have crapped in the house - and I always ask the police whether it's soft or hard. They look at me like I'm absolutely mad. And I say, if it's soft, then it's somebody who's anxious, so you get a kid who goes and craps on the bed. And if it's really hard stool then it's an indication of somebody who's angry and bitter about what he's doing."" Another key question is: Does the culprit do it repeatedly in the same place? If they're regular (so to speak), ""it becomes a message to somebody or some people,"" says Prof Berry. Obviously, there are unfortunate situations in which someone with an upset stomach or a more serious bowel condition might be unable to make it to the toilet in time. But looking purely at those who do it deliberately, we can divide the cases into one-off incidents, and systematic campaigns. A furious Canadian woman arrested last month appears to fall into the first category. She was caught on camera defecating on the floor of a Tim Hortons coffee house in British Columbia, then flinging the result at staff. It was later reported that they had refused to let her use the toilet. In the second category - that of repeat offenders - we find examples like the Colorado jogger dubbed ""the mad pooper"", who sparked a police hunt last year after defecating outside a family's home for weeks on end. 'Fascination with faeces' While the experts won't comment on individual cases, they agree that ""serial poopers"" are often trying to stick two fingers up to the world. ""Usually it's a statement like, 'Life is shit, so stand in it,'"" says Mike Fisher, director of the British Association of Anger Management. ""I mean, somebody who defecates in public has mental health issues. It's as simple as that. If you're socialised, that's the last thing that you would do."" Mr Fisher notes that people who defecate in public may have scatological tendencies - or ""a fascination with their own poo"". ""I remember being on a workshop many years ago when a French bloke told us how when he was a kid, he would actually shit in the bath and smear faeces all over himself,"" he says. ""That is a classic example of scatology."" And as an adult? ""He's not smearing [it] all over himself, but he's still got the same fascination with his own faeces."" The American Council on Science and Health says public pooing could also point to an elimination disorder - a kind of condition where urine or faeces are passed in places other than the toilet. The behaviour may or may not be within the individual's control. Caught short Every so often, a misplaced turd might just be the work of ""someone who's halfway home from the pub,"" says Prof Berry. ""The guy gets caught short, and he's learned he can go and crap on the lawn outside number 3 because there's nobody there, but he can't go and crap outside number 33 because it sets off an alarm system with lights flashing, etc!"" Ultimate primal weapon Misbehaviour with faeces violates one of society's last taboos. If you doubt that, just look at the way poo is deployed in prison protests, where it functions as a primal weapon. No matter how powerless you might otherwise be, excrement is available (and disgusting) to almost all of us. ""We have the famous cases in the 70s where IRA men used to wipe the walls with their faeces as a protest,"" notes Prof Berry. When it comes to stopping public defecators, the experts warn there's no single solution - and shaming them is definitely not the answer. Mr Fisher says anti-social behaviour can be linked to trauma, which frequently stems from childhood. ""I would say most cases [of chronic anger] that I deal with are directly linked to unfinished business from the past,"" he says. ""Not only unresolved anger issues - it might be rage issues, it might be shame issues."" How might that happen? He cites the example of a child who defecates in the family home and is severely beaten by one of their parents. ""Trauma is going to be manifested in a whole range of cognitive dissonances, or physical acting-out."" Maybe that's worth bearing in mind the next time a ""phantom pooper"", ""faecal fiend"" or ""bowel movement bandit"" hits the headlines.","This piece contains language which some might find offensive In parts of the world blessed with effective, modern sanitation, it's widely understood that poo belongs inside a person, or a toilet."
"Cancer and transplant patients are the first to have benefited. The US said the channel was subject to ""strict due diligence measures to avoid misuse by the Iranian regime"". Humanitarian supplies are exempt from the US sanctions, but the measures have deterred several foreign banks from doing any business with Tehran. The Swiss government said the new payment mechanism was aimed at ensuring that companies based in Switzerland had a ""secure payment channel with a Swiss bank through which payments for their exports to Iran are guaranteed."" ""In this way, Switzerland is helping to supply the Iranian population with agricultural commodities, food, medicines and medical equipment. This is in keeping with Switzerland's humanitarian tradition,"" it said. Under the rules of the new mechanism, the US provides assurances that transactions are not violating sanctions, the Swiss government statement added. In turn, exporters and participating banks provide information on their business activities and partners in Iran. As a pilot transaction, a payment was made for a shipment of cancer drugs and drugs required for organ transplants worth some €2.3m ($2.55m; £1.9m). The US Treasury Department confirmed the completion of initial financial transactions through the new payment mechanism, saying they provided a ""model for facilitating further humanitarian exports to Iran"". Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the US government had full confidence that the mechanism ""will improve the flow of humanitarian goods to the Iranian people."" ""Humanitarian transactions are currently allowed under our sanctions programs, and we encourage companies to use this humanitarian mechanism,"" he added. The US reinstated economic sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark deal in May 2018 aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions. Mr Trump has said he wants to apply ""maximum pressure"" on the government in Tehran to compel it to renegotiate the accord. The launch of the new payment channel comes after a peak US-Iran tension. In January, a top Iranian military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed in Iraq in a US drone strike. Days later, Iran shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet with 176 on board - the military said it was mistaken for a US cruise missile. Those killed included dozens of Iranians and Canadians, as well as nationals from Ukraine, the UK, Afghanistan and Germany.",A new Swiss payment mechanism has launched which allows humanitarian aid to be sent to Iran without falling foul of US sanctions.
"More than 1,700 people are believed to have died this year so far, compared with 96 deaths up to the end of April last year. As many as 800 migrants are feared drowned after the boat they were travelling in capsized in Libyan waters south of the Italian island of Lampedusa on Sunday. The IOM believes the number of migrants dying in Mediterranean Sea crossings could hit 30,000 this year if the current rate continues. Federico Soda, IOM's Italy director, said the Italian maritime forces were doing ""incredible work"" trying to rescue as many people as possible, but that the rising number of deaths was ""unacceptable"". ""Search and rescue efforts must be more comprehensive and supported by the European Union and its member states. This is a humanitarian emergency that involves us all and responses to it must be more holistic."" Perilous journeys By far the largest number of migrant deaths internationally have taken place in the Mediterranean, according to the IOM. The figures are striking. Not including Sunday's sinking, nearly eight out of every 10 deaths have taken place there this year. By comparison, the second highest number of migrants died in the Horn of Africa where fewer than one in 10 deaths occurred. Of those migrants who die in the Mediterranean, the vast majority of them began their journey in Sub-Saharan Africa. Most dangerous routes Within the Mediterranean, the Central migration route from North Africa to Italy and Malta is the deadliest. So far this year, 910 people have been killed as a result of attempting the journey. The 800 potential victims of Sunday's sinking are also likely to join their number. A much smaller number of migrants died travelling along the Mediterranean's other routes - to its east and west and towards Apulia and Calabria, Italy. Last year, a total of 3,279 migrants were killed as a result of their journey across the sea to Europe. Again, by far the majority died along the Central Mediterranean route. Death rate Some 912 out of 954 of this year's deaths have been on routes towards Italy, as of 17 April. The IOM estimates that 21,191 migrants have reached the Italian coasts alive during the same period. This makes the rate of death en route to Italy so far this year 4.13 per 100 people. By comparison, some 26,644 migrants had made it alive to Italy by 30 April last year - an increase of 5,000 more than this year - according to data provided by the Italian Ministry of Interior. Who are the victims? Looking back to 2014 as a whole, the African nations with the most migrants reaching Italy were Eritrea, Mali and Nigeria. The numbers of men braving the journey vastly outnumbered the women. By Emily Maguire, Lucy Rodgers, Nassos Stylianou, John Walton","Increasing numbers of migrants are losing their lives as they make the treacherous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe, figures from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) show."
"Satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine said last week that his wife Penelope had been paid hundreds of thousands of euros for fake jobs. Now it has reported that she earned far more and for longer. Mr Fillon hit back, calling the claims a campaign to destroy his candidacy. ""Never in the history of the Fifth Republic has such an operation of very professional slander been launched in an attempt to eliminate a candidate,"" he said. He earlier insisted he and his wife had nothing to hide. His campaign team told Le Monde that the fresh allegations did not change a thing but just gave a more impressive figure. Nevertheless, his reputation and poll ratings have been badly damaged by the claims. The newspaper said on Tuesday that Welsh-born Penelope Fillon had been paid €830,000 (£710,000; $900,000) for working as a parliamentary aide to her husband and his deputy over two periods, €330,000 more than it originally alleged. That was on top of the €100,000 that it says she was paid by a literary review owned by a wealthy friend of her husband called Marc Ladreit de Lacharriere. Read more on this story: Two of the couple's children, the weekly added, had been paid €84,000 for working as Mr Fillon's parliamentary assistants. Mr Fillon has already said he employed the pair for specific tasks. MPs and senators in France are allowed to employ family members, but Le Canard Enchaine said it had found no evidence that Penelope Fillon had ever done any work. The couple were interviewed separately on Monday by investigators for more than five hours as part of a preliminary inquiry that may or may not lead to formal investigation. On Tuesday morning, anti-corruption police raided parliamentary offices, reportedly in a search for contracts covering Mrs Fillon's work there. Opinion poll blow Mr Fillon's lawyer, Antonin Levy, told French radio that the candidate had not had a constituency office while working as an MP and had instead used his home. ""And who is at home? Penelope Fillon of course,"" he said. The head of the parliamentary Republican party, Christian Jacob, has said that MPs are unanimous in their support for Mr Fillon, 62, and are standing by him. But an opinion poll for BFMTV on Tuesday suggested that 76% of French voters were unconvinced by his explanation and the affair has already hit his poll ratings. He is now running neck and neck with centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron, who is also likely to pick up votes from disenchanted supporters on the right of the Socialist party. Both are a few points behind far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who would win 25% of the vote, but either candidate would beat her in the second round run-off in May, polls suggest. Mr Fillon, who campaigned on his reputation for integrity and beat former president Nicolas Sarkozy and former prime minister Alain Juppe to his party's nomination, had been leading in opinion polls. He has vowed to slash 500,000 public sector jobs, cut benefits and increase working time.","France's centre-right presidential candidate, Francois Fillon, has been hit by further allegations on the day that anti-corruption police raided his office in parliament."
"By Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Communities in the Alps have been protecting themselves against such natural hazards for years. Before Wednesday's landslide, sensors on the Piz Cenaglo, high above the Bondasca valley, had already shown that the rock mass was moving. That warning triggered the automatic closure of some sections of road. The village of Bondo had a narrow escape. The four million cubic metres (141m cubic feet) of mud and rock which thundered down the mountain ended up just centimetres from people's homes. That wasn't just luck. Bondo has a concrete barrier to protect it from the full force of a landslide, and the river bed in the Bondasca Valley has been widened in the hope of channelling landslides away from populated areas. But the size of Wednesday's slide was a shock, and some scientists are now warning that the alpine regions can expect more events like this in the future. Permafrost thaw The reason is that the high mountains are not as cold as they once were. Marcia Phillips, a permafrost researcher with Switzerland's Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research, has been analysing temperatures all over the Alps. ""We have bore holes at different depths in different terrain and the ones that are in rock walls are showing a distinct warming over the last 10 to 20 years,"" she explained. That would not be a problem if the rock was simply rock, but the rock in large sections of the Swiss Alps is cracked and fractured - between the layers of rock there are layers of permafrost. Ice in fact, but ice that is not supposed to melt. ""We have a problem if the temperature rises above -1.5C because the permafrost has a stabilising function,"" Ms Phillips said. Compounding the weakening permafrost is another phenomenon associated with global warming - Switzerland's glaciers are noticeably retreating. The glacier at the base of Piz Cenaglo provided additional stability to the rock above it, but that glacier has shrunk in recent years. So precarious had the mountain become that Marcia and her colleagues had given up on borehole testing and instead resorted to remote monitoring. ""It is cracked and unstable up there,"" she explained, ""It was just too dangerous."" Infrastructure fears Another headache associated with thawing permafrost is the possible risk to winter tourism. The stanchions of cable cars and chairlifts are very often anchored in permafrost. The Swiss government already requires intensive monitoring of cable car infrastructure. Lift operators must check regularly for any movement or creep. Marcia Phillips suggests that, if temperatures do continue to rise, changes may have to be made. ""I could foresee some having to be closed down or rebuilt,"" she said. In preparation, the avalanche institute has already produced a book ""Building in Permafrost"" with guidelines on how to build safely. ""It is possible but very, very expensive,"" said Ms Phillips. That is not good news for Switzerland's tourism resorts, already suffering financially because of the strength of the Swiss franc. For now, though, the focus remains on finding the eight people still missing from Wednesday's landslide, and on protecting those who live in the Bondasca Valley. The residents of Bondo have been told they cannot go home yet. Four million cubic metres of rock came down but another million, very unstable, still looms above the village.","A massive rockslide in Switzerland's Val Bondasca was not a complete surprise. Many parts of Switzerland, two thirds of which is mountainous, are at risk of avalanches and landslides."
"The 57km (35-mile) twin-bore Gotthard base tunnel will provide a high-speed rail link under the Swiss Alps between northern and southern Europe. Switzerland says it will revolutionise European freight transport. Goods currently carried on the route by a million lorries a year will go by train instead. The tunnel has overtaken Japan's 53.9km Seikan rail tunnel as the longest in the world and pushed the 50.5km Channel Tunnel linking the UK and France into third place. In a speech to guests in Erstfeld, near the northern entrance to the tunnel, Swiss Federal President Johann Schneider-Ammann said it was a ""giant step for Switzerland but equally for our neighbours and the rest of the continent"". A live relay carried a speech from the southern end of the tunnel, in Bodio, by the Swiss federal transport minister, Doris Leuthard. Afterwards two trains set off in opposite directions through the tunnel, each carrying hundreds of guests who had won tickets in a draw, and the new route was formally open. A lavish show then got under way for the assembled guests in Erstfeld, with dancers, acrobats, singers and musicians celebrating Alpine culture and history. European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Italy's Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern also attended the day's events. Mr Hollande, who took part with others in a follow-up trip through the tunnel on a train, emerged on the southern side to give a speech in which he compared the Gotthard to the Channel Tunnel. Recalling the great Franco-British project, which was completed in 1994, he said: ""Nobody could have imagined that one day you would be able to travel from England to France in that way."" ""Since then we are more united than ever and I hope the British will remember that when the day comes,"" he added, to laughter and applause from the audience in the Swiss village of Pollegio. The UK holds a referendum on 23 June on whether or not to remain in the EU. The French leader went on to praise European aspirations, including the free movement of people and goods. The presence of high-level guests at the opening shows that the new tunnel is about more than protecting the Alpine environment, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports. Europe's goods, whether Italian wine for the Netherlands or German cars for Greece, have to cross the Alps. Now they will able to do so more quickly, more safely, and more cheaply, our correspondent says. The project, which cost more than $12bn (£8.3bn) to build, was endorsed by Swiss voters in a referendum in 1992. Voters then backed a proposal from environmental groups to move all freight travelling through Switzerland from road to rail two years later. The completed tunnel travels up to 2.3 km below the surface of the mountains above and through rock that reaches temperatures of 46C. Engineers had to dig and blast through 73 different kinds of rock, some as hard as granite and others as soft as sugar. More than 28m tonnes of rock was excavated, which was then broken down to help make the concrete used to build the tunnel. Now the completed tunnel, delivered on time and within budget, will create a mainline rail connection between Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Genoa in Italy. When full services begin in December, the journey time for travellers between Zurich and Milan will be reduced by an hour to two hours and 40 minutes. The tunnel's course is flat and straight instead of winding up through the mountains like the old rail tunnel and a road tunnel opened in 1980. About 260 freight trains and 65 passenger trains will pass through the tunnel each day in a journey taking as little as 17 minutes. The tunnel is being financed by value-added and fuel taxes, road charges on heavy vehicles and state loans that are due to be repaid within a decade. Swiss bank Credit Suisse has said its economic benefits will include the easier movement of goods and increased tourism. Nine workers died in accidents while the tunnel was under construction. Four were Germans, three Italians, and one each came from South Africa and Austria, according to German news agency dpa. They are commemorated by a plaque near the northern end of the tunnel, Swiss media report.","The world's longest and deepest rail tunnel has officially opened in Switzerland, after almost two decades of construction work."
"By Michael Bristow & Martin PatienceBBC News, Beijing The source, who did not want to be identified, said the allegations against Bo Xilai were ""preposterous"". Mr Bo was sacked from his job in charge of the city of Chongqing after his police chief fled to a US consulate, causing major embarrassment to Beijing. Since then, a steady stream of damaging stories about Mr Bo have emerged. Earlier this week it emerged that the British government had asked the Chinese authorities to re-open an investigation into the death of UK businessman Neil Heywood, a close friend of Mr Bo. Unconfirmed media reports suggest Mr Bo's police chief had information about Mr Heywood's death. 'Just preposterous' Bo Xilai was one of China's top politicians, tipped for even higher office when the Chinese Communist Party carries out a once-in-a-decade leadership change later this year. Many thought he would be promoted to the Standing Committee of the party's politburo, the nine-man body that runs China. Suave and sophisticated, he was popular in Chongqing where he was party secretary, the top job in the city. He also appeared to have support in the higher echelons of the Communist Party. Many national leaders visited Chongqing after the 62-year-old took charge there in 2007. But since his sacking that support has disappeared - and a series of accusations have been levelled against Mr Bo. One suggested Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun fled to the US consulate because Mr Bo reacted angrily when told of an investigation into his family. ""That's just preposterous,"" the Bo family contact told the BBC. He said the relationship between Mr Bo and Mr Wang was ""normal"" just days before the policeman fled. ""He was pledging his allegiance,"" said the contact. He added that members of Mr Bo's family had worked hard to avoid the appearance that they were benefiting from the politician's rise. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, apparently gave up her career as a high-flying lawyer a few years ago. ""She shut down her law firm just when it was getting very big and exciting for her,"" said the source. Mr Bo had also been accused of praising the Cultural Revolution, a chaotic period from 1966-1976 when normal life was turned upside down. While in charge in Chongqing he launched a campaign to re-energise people's enthusiasm for China's communist past under Mao Zedong. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao made a thinly veiled attack on Mr Bo's project at a press conference just the day before he was sacked. The family contact said: ""Any suggestion that Bo Xilai wanted to go back to the Cultural Revolution period is wrong, given that he spent some of that time in jail."" The source wanted to counter the impression among many that Mr Bo was an ambitious politician who sought popularity to further his political goals. He said Mr Bo acted only out of a ""sense of duty"". ""The problem with China's government is that it's strayed too far from the people. If you do things for people, others say you are being a populist,"" he added. Major stir The source said Mr Bo had nothing to do with the death of Neil Heywood, the British businessman who died in Chongqing in November 2011. There are rumours that Mr Wang, Bo Xilai's police chief, fled because he had details about a connection between Mr Bo's family and Mr Heywood. It has emerged that Mr Wang first arranged a meeting at the UK consulate in Chongqing, but never turned up. Mr Heywood, who worked as a consultant in China, was a friend of Bo Xilai, but the family contact denied there were any business dealings between the two. Police say the 41-year-old died of excessive alcohol consumption - friends say he drank only occasionally. Bo Xilai has disappeared from public view since his sacking last month and it is unclear whether he is under investigation or still has his seat on the party's 25-member politburo. But the damaging stories about him continue. Whatever the truth behind them, his downfall has caused a major stir within the Chinese political establishment. The claims and counter claims suggest there is a major battle between political rivals ahead of the leadership changeover.","A politician at the heart of China's biggest political scandal in years is the victim of a smear campaign, a source close to his family has said."
"Sunday's fatal shooting of a black man by a white officer has quickly become one of the biggest tests of the 37-year-old Democrat's presidential race. His response has drawn mixed reviews, and highlighted tensions with South Bend's African-American community. The family of the victim have voiced complaints of his leadership. Mr Buttigieg, a contender in the Democratic 2020 primary field, returned to South Bend after 54-year-old Eric Logan was shot after police say he lunged at an officer with a knife while he was caught breaking into cars. The young mayor has said he would be open to an independent investigation and ordered that going forward, all officers be required to turn on their body cameras before interactions with members of the community. Fans of ""Mayor Pete"" - a gay military veteran - have praised his return to the community during his campaign, while others say it reveals his struggle to attract support from African-American voters. Tensions have been high with South Bend's African-American community since he fired the city's first-ever black chief of police during his first term in office in 2012, he noted in his memoir. The mayor recalled the incident ""affected my relationship with the African-American community in particular for years to come"". At a swearing-in ceremony for six white police cadets on Wednesday, Mr Buttigieg said ""years working to build trust between city leaders, public safety officers and members of the community we are charged to serve... are in jeopardy"", due to Sunday's shooting. More on 'Mayor Pete' Buttigieg ""We are facing the consequences not just of distant historical wrongs, but of things happening in our present - a seemingly constant series of stories and videos from around the country showing abuses that tarnish the badge and fuel mistrust,"" he said. The victim's mother, Shirley Newbill, criticised his meeting with the family, saying he ""ain't done nothing"". ""He ain't recognise me as the mother of nothing. He didn't say nothing to me,"" she said. Mr Buttigieg is due to resume his campaign over the weekend, with events planned in the crucial state of South Carolina, but has said he is uncertain when he will begin again. ""Mayors, like presidents, have to do many things at once,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. More on the 2020 presidential race","Democratic presidential candidate and mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg is under scrutiny for his handling of a police shooting at home."
"Telephone engineers Mr L Le Huray and Mr P G Warder were separated from their families for five years from 1940. A retired BT engineer recently took files to BT Archives in London that show the islands' governments held the pair back to train staff. Authorities also resisted an attempted rescue by the RAF, the files have also revealed. More news from the Channel Islands. Mr Le Hurray was one of three operators based in Jersey before the war, and Mr Warder one of five in Guernsey. Letters between post office mangers suggested Mr Le Hurray and Mr Warder had ""fallen victims to their duty"" after the States of Jersey and Guernsey refused to let them leave until they had trained others to use the telecoms equipment. Further letters say although the men were instructed to leave on 19 June and 29 June, ""each time the decision was reversed after representations had been made by the island authorities"". The occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 - 9 May 1945): A rescue attempt was launched by the RAF in July 1940, but British troops again met resistance from the island's governments. Writing in a letter to Mrs Le Huray the mission's commander, Francis Taylor, says they would have succeeded ""but for the attitude adopted by the Bailiff of Guernsey"" who informed him both men were being ""retained"" by the islands. Communications were re-established shortly after Victory in Europe Day (8 May 1945) when, according to the post office accounts, Mr Warder decided to ""take over"" the post office station in Jersey. ""Presenting himself at the Jersey repeater station [he] informed the officer in charge of the guard that he intended to take over the building on behalf of the British Post Office. ""The officer clicked his heels, saluted and said 'very good Mr Warder'. ""The repeater station was once more British property.""",The struggle of two post office workers forced to live under Nazi rule in the Channel Islands has been revealed.
"Aurigny suffered £9.7m losses - more than those incurred in 2018 and 2017, which were £4.4m and £5.2m. In October, it forecast a 2020 loss of more than £9m, which did not anticipate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It blamed the latest figures on ""erratic market conditions"" created by deregulating the market and States subsidies for competitors. In the 2019 budget, Aurigny had been expected to lose £4.4m, but in September a 73% rise to £7.6m was predicted, and the accounts show its actual losses in 2019 were £9.7m. 'Role of competition' Aurigny acknowledged £2.8m had been lost on the Alderney route, but this was the same as 2018. A spokeswoman said: ""The bulk of the losses incurred in the year are attributable to the erratic market conditions seen throughout 2019 created by the 'open skies' policy, as well as subsidised competition and unsustainable ticket prices."" The airline emphasised their role as an ""essential investment"", providing ""lifeline services"" during the coronavirus pandemic. It added the company was ready to become an ""economic enabler"" once travel resumes and hopes to start an ""air travel corridor"" between the island and the Isle of Man. Deputy Gavin St Pier, the President of the Committee for Policy and Resources, acknowledged the open skies policy had ""changed"" the marketplace in 2019. He said: ""There are some very real challenges about the size of our market and therefore the role of competition."" Aurigny's function as a ""strategic asset"" is a question the States must resolve soon, given the ""substantial cost"" to taxpayers, Mr St Pier argued. A short term goal of the States' proposed ""revive and thrive"" economic recovery strategy is completing a review into travel links, which includes examining Aurigny's role as an economic enabler, he added.","Guernsey's airline cost taxpayers nearly £10m last year, almost £2m more than expected, States accounts reveal."
"These party members have since been arrested or jailed in a wide-reaching corruption crackdown launched by Mr Xi. Some observers have said the crackdown was used to conduct a political purge of Mr Xi's opponents. The latest claim of a power struggle appears to contradict the Communist Party's unified image. On Thursday, the chief of China's securities commissions, Liu Shiyu, listed names of six ""high-ranking and powerful officials, who were hugely greedy and hugely corrupt, and who plotted to usurp the party's leadership and seize state power"". Mr Liu's list included top names whose downfalls have attracted intense scrutiny, such as former security chief Zhou Yongkang, prominent politician Bo Xilai, and Sun Zhengcai, a member of the decision-making Politburo body who was only recently expelled. The other names were former presidential aide Ling Jihua, the late army general Xu Caihou, and former top military officer Guo Boxiong. ""These cases were definitely shocking,"" said Mr Liu, who was speaking at a panel for the ongoing Communist Party congress in Beijing. It was unclear whether he was referring to one co-ordinated plot or separate attempts at a coup. Mr Liu said that Mr Xi had ""addressed these problems, and eliminated a huge and hidden danger to the party and the country"". More than one million officials have been jailed or arrested in the corruption crackdown which began shortly after Mr Xi took power in 2012. The depth of the crackdown has led many to speculate that some arrests were politically motivated and that part of Mr Xi's overall strategy was to consolidate power. Mr Xi had previously denied claims there was a ""power struggle"" within the party. But the comments appear to corroborate what has long been suspected - that there are intense power struggles going on behind the party's image of unity, says the BBC's Michael Bristow. The claim comes as Mr Xi created his own political ideology, in the latest move to entrench his position in the Communist Party. The party is widely expected to rewrite its constitution to enshrine this theory before congress ends next week.",A top Chinese official has claimed several high-ranking members of the Communist Party had plotted to seize power from President Xi Jinping.
"A missile hit a petrol station 50m (164ft) from the entrance of the Kitaf rural hospital on Tuesday morning, according to Save the Children. The blast also injured eight people. It was not clear who was behind the attack, but a Saudi-led coalition is carrying out air strikes in support of the government in Yemen's civil war. The coalition insists it never deliberately targets civilians, but human rights groups have accused it of bombing markets, schools, hospitals and residential areas. Tuesday was the fourth anniversary of the escalation of the civil war, which has killed thousands and pushed millions to the brink of starvation. What happened in Kitaf? Save the Children says the petrol station in the area, which is 60km (40 miles) from the city of Saada, was struck by a missile at about 09:30 (06:30 GMT) on Tuesday, as many people were arriving at the nearby hospital. An eight-year-old boy was the youngest person killed. Another boy aged 10, two boys aged 12, and one boy aged 14 also lost their lives. One injured health worker, who was in the emergency room treating two young children when the strike happened, said: ""All people were screaming and running out of the hospital. The structure of the hospital was totally damaged inside. Our colleague lost two children. They were burned. ""I got injured in my head and I was bleeding. I ran away from the hospital with my colleague to a safe place but we found nothing that could help me stop the bleeding. It was the most difficult moment of my life."" Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the chief executive of Save the Children International, said she was ""shocked and appalled by this outrageous attack"" on a medical facility that the charity supported, and she demanded an urgent investigation. ""Innocent children and health workers have lost their lives in what appears to been an indiscriminate attack on a hospital in a densely populated civilian area. Attacks like these are a breach of international law,"" she added. This hospital was ""de-conflicted"", which means all the warring parties were made aware of its location and were obliged to avoid it by a radius of 100m. Residents and the rebel Houthi movement blamed the Saudi-led coalition for the attack, and Save the Children noted that the only warring party with access to planes that can carry out air strikes is the coalition. The rebel-run health ministry condemned the ""coalition's continued disregard for Yemeni lives"" and said it had committed four war crimes in targeting the hospital. There was no immediate comment from coalition officials. Save the Children reported on Monday that at least 226 Yemeni children had been killed and 217 more injured in air raids carried out by the Saudi-led coalition in the past year. Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen has been devastated by a conflict that escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad. Alarmed by the rise of a group they saw as an Iranian proxy, the UAE, Saudi Arabia and seven other Arab states intervened in an attempt to restore the government. The UN says at least 7,025 civilians have been killed and 11,140 injured in the fighting. Thousands more civilians have died from preventable causes, including malnutrition, disease and poor health. About 80% of the population - 24 million people - need humanitarian assistance and protection. About 20 million need help securing food, including almost 10 million who the UN says are just a step away from famine. Almost 240,000 of those people are facing ""catastrophic levels of hunger"". Yemen has also struggled to deal with the largest cholera outbreak ever recorded, which has resulted in 1.49 million suspected cases and 2,960 related deaths.","A charity has condemned an air strike near a hospital in rebel-held north-western Yemen that killed at least eight people, five of them children."
"Home Affairs Minister Bill Malarkey told the House of Keys that 58 of the 107 drivers stopped in three sessions were issued with Vehicle Defect Rectification Scheme (VDRS) notices. He said one vehicle had been seized. In 2018, 122 of the 220 vehicles stopped were defective, a number police said was ""ridiculously high"". The annual roadside checks, which continue through the winter months, are carried out by police officers in conjunction with the Department of Infrastructure. In the House of Keys, Ralph Peake MHK said the campaign was ""a good way of raising the profile of having safer vehicles on the road"" during the winter, but added that the government needed to ""take a more proactive stance"" at all times. Mr Malarkey said any further action would ""depend on the final results of the campaign"". VDRS notices allow drivers to have minor defects fixed within seven days without facing further action. Privately-owned Manx-registered vehicles that are more than three years old are not subject to an annual roadworthiness check, such as the UK's MOT test. However, vehicles imported to the island that are more than three years old are subject to a one-off examination at the Manx vehicle test centre.","More than half of the vehicles stopped by Manx police during a winter checks campaign were found to have at least one defect, a government minister said."
"They include the introduction of air freight charges, significant rises in parking charges at the airport and increases to a range of harbour fees. The Public Services Department had been asked to generate an extra £1.8m, but has asked the States to agree to £1m. If agreed, the new charges could may come into effect as early as April. Public Services Minister Bernard Flouquet said the current airport parking charges and harbour mooring fees were ""significantly lower than the average"". He said even after the 15% rise in mooring fees and increases of up to £2 a day for airport parking that would continue to be the case. Deputy Flouquet said: ""What we don't want to do is price anyone out of boating, but we feel there is scope for increasing in mooring charges and, likewise, airport parking without having undue impact."" The department said increasing the crane charges at St Sampson's Harbour would mostly apply to the importation of aggregates, concrete and other heavy materials or bulk cargo. The proposed air freight charge is 3.4p per kilo. Deputy Flouquet said: ""Where freight charges are concerned, there is a potential for increases to impact on everyone in the island, because we all rely on goods bought in. We have therefore looked to apply these selectively, and focus on charges we think there is scope to increase but minimise any impact."" If the States does not agree with Public Services' request to reduce the extra income needed to £1m the department has suggested the additional £800,000 could be raised through an import tax on hydrocarbon fuels. The report, which is due to be debated in March, also outlines a number of other options for raising further income through increasing airport passenger charges or a landing fee for cruise ship passengers.",Details of proposals to generate more than £1m extra in income from Guernsey's harbours and airport have been released.
"By Lizz PearsonBBC News, Arusha, Tanzania She had done her homework, but was having trouble sleeping. ""There were seven of them. They forced their way into our huts, and rounded us up outside. ""What they wanted was to rape us,"" she says. But this time she and her friends were lucky. ""The men were drunk, so we managed to escape,"" she says. It does not always work out that way and Usta's story is becoming increasingly familiar in rural parts of Tanzania where more senior schools have sprung in the last decade. Many teenage girls who desperately want to finish their education live far from the safety of their villages and parents in huts that the locals call ""ghettos"". There they run the risk of attack so they do not have to walk up to 10km (six miles) twice a day to and from school. In Mbulu district, more than 150km (100 miles) west of Arusha, it is believed there are hundreds of girls living in this dangerous accommodation who are being harassed and - in more extreme cases - raped. The cramped earth dwellings are cheap to rent - but they do not get much for their money. There is no electricity, no water, and no security for the girls living in them. They have flimsy wooden doors, and as children tend to live in groups together, the areas quickly become known as places where they are alone - and vulnerable. Inside, girls brighten up the walls with pictures torn from magazines or newspapers. But though they do their best to make the ghettos feel like home, it is harder to make them feel safe. They may be frightened but decide to stay because they know that education, for many, is the only way out of future poverty. School drop-outs Simon Daffi, from Arusha-based Community Aid and Small Enterprises Consultancy (Casec), says he is concerned about the sexual harassment girls living in the ghettos face. There are drop-out rates in some schools of up to 20% for girls, mostly aged between 13 and 17, because of pregnancy, he says. Some head teachers suspect this may also be as a result of rapes, which often go unreported by victims for fear of the stigma. Mr Daffi believes the problems are partly down to Tanzania's educational success since 2000 - when the country's debts were cancelled allowing it to focus on schooling. ""As a result of an expansion in primary schools, there was increased demand for secondaries. But there were no structures to respond adequately,"" he says. More secondary schools were built, one for each ward of five villages in rural areas. But that meant the schools were not within easy reach of all the children who needed them. Rented ghettos seemed the best solution. There have been three rapes in the ghettos near Tumati School, where Usta is a student. None of them has resulted in a conviction, although in two cases, the men were caught. Usta knew two of the girls who were attacked: Both have left school without their O-level exams. The rapes have taken away her faith in the local community, and the police. ""These drunks know they won't be caught because the nearest police station is 7km away,"" she says. ""Even if we scream for help, people hardly come to our rescue. By the time the police get here, well... they'll already be finished. ""So the men just do what they want."" Usta has learned to look out for herself. She plans her sleep and study around when the men might ""invade"". But her vigilance means she regularly falls asleep in lessons, and her school performance has suffered as a result. Dormitories She has already missed a lot of school because her family could not afford the fees and now, aged 20, wonders if she will ever finish her O-level exams. Casec, with funding from a British charity, African Initiatives, has begun an extensive building programme, putting up dormitories in school grounds. With girls in this safe housing, they hope the pregnancy and drop-out rates will fall. But in most schools, hostels will not have places for all the girls who need them and progress on building is slow. That is why Rosie Martin, chief executive of African Initiatives, is ploughing money into Casec's educational work with villagers. ""It's not enough just to build a hostel to keep girls safe. It's this endemic idea that men have rights over women that needs to change,"" she says. For Mr Daffi, getting the schoolgirls into hostels cannot come quickly enough. ""In Tanzania, we also have the saying: 'If you educate a woman, you educate the whole nation',"" he says.

"Overview: James Manicom, Centre for International Governance Innovation, Canada The dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands is more than 30 years old and tensions over the East China Sea have flared periodically since 2000 as China has become a more proactive maritime power. However, since the nationalisation of the islands by the Japanese government in September 2012, the dispute has taken on a decidedly more ominous character. Both governments are motivated to maintain their claim to the islands through acts that reinforce their sovereignty and neither government has the incentive to back down. Japanese leaders deny the very existence of a dispute over the islands and Shinzo Abe's foreign policy platform, which rests on the notion of Japanese resurgence, reflects a broader reluctance in Japan to tolerate further perceived Chinese encroachments into Japanese territory. Chinese leaders seem determined to undermine the Japanese claim over the islands by challenging Japan's administration of the islands and the waters that surround them. To this end it has regularised patrols of the territorial sea by its coast guard, announced base points around the islands and, most recently, included the islands in its air defence identification zone (ADIZ) that encompasses much of the East China Sea. The question remains whether China will try to occupy the territory of the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in some way, which could potentially trigger armed conflict between China and Japan and potentially the United States. Despite the escalation of tensions however, there has been considerable informal discussion about ways to improve ties. There have been a number of meetings between various ministries on confidence and transparency building between naval and coast guard forces in the East China Sea. Furthermore, in early 2013 both leaders publicly articulated a willingness to rebuild ties with the other. The two sides have a decent track record of dispute management characterised by ignoring the sovereignty dispute over the islands and by managing the jurisdictional disputes that arise in the surrounding waters over fisheries or resource development. Two key uncertainties are the conditions under which the two will begin improving their relationship and the stability of any new ""status quo"" that will be negotiated around the islands. China's ADIZ announcement suggests that Chinese leaders are only interested in talks with Japan under conditions including parity in authority exercised over the surrounding seas and an admission by Japan that a dispute exists over the islands. Neither of these conditions is acceptable to Tokyo, which has offered to concede that the two have a territorial ""problem"" rather than a dispute. However, despite their de facto acceptance of periodic Chinese patrols of the territorial sea since the nationalisation, it is not clear that Japan will accept in perpetuity daily intrusions into these waters by Chinese ships and aircraft. On balance the prognosis is negative. Despite the stated willingness to co-operate, it is not clear the two sides agree on the conditions that would form the pretext of closer ties. Continued Japanese restraint in the face of Chinese efforts to modify the status quo is currently keeping the peace, potentially to the detriment of Japan's claim to the islands and its ability to use the surrounding sea area. It is not clear that the Abe administration will tolerate this situation indefinitely. China: Victor Gao, Director of the China National Association of International Studies Japan seems to ignore the fact that it has demarcated a similar identification zone in the East China Sea for years, and has expanded this zone over the years. In fact, the western-most line of Japan's zone stretches all the way to China and is only about 135km (84 miles) from China's coast at the closest point. In recent years, Japan has on many occasions scrambled fighter planes to warn off Chinese planes when they entered the Japanese zone, as if the zone were Japan's territorial space. In a sense, China's announcement of an identification zone is in response to Japan's abusive use of its zone to start with. It is important to note that the Chinese and Japanese zones overlap to a large extent. Therefore, both nations need to handle themselves carefully and prudently to avoid any miscalculations or unintended consequences. However, the fundamental reason for the deterioration of relations between Japan and its two important neighbours, China and South Korea, is because Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and many Japanese politicians still refuse to acknowledge war atrocities. They deny the existence of the Nanjing Massacre, they claim the Korean sex slaves worked voluntarily, they continue to worship at the Yasukuni Shrine. They also want to abandon the peace commitment set out in the Japanese constitution, and rearm. Although Japan is doing its utmost to tie the United States to its bandwagon, China and the US are significantly increasing their military co-operation and strategic dialogue. After all, China and the US shed blood together to defeat Japan in WWII, and, with increasing dialogue and confidence-building measures between Beijing and Washington, it is highly unlikely that the US will shed blood to encourage or even to protect a militarising Japan. China is urging Japan to unequivocally renounce the war atrocities and come back to the negotiating table regarding the territorial dispute over the Diaoyu Islands. China and Japan can only resolve this dispute through peaceful negotiations. Recognising the territorial dispute and coming back to the negotiating table is the only sensible choice for Japan. Japan: Tetsuo Kotani, Japan Institute of International Affairs The ownership of the Senkaku Islands was reaffirmed under the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, which demarcated Japan's territory after World War II, and the 1971 US-Japan Okinawa Reversion Treaty, which returned the administrative rights of Okinawa, including the Senkaku Islands, from the United States to Japan. By challenging Japan's control of the islands, China is attempting to introduce a new regional order that favours it. As long as Beijing remains revisionist, it will not be easy to improve relations between Tokyo and Beijing. Business and cultural exchanges between Japan and China have been recovering since the beginning of this year, but political relations remain difficult. Tokyo is willing to engage in dialogue with Beijing with no conditions. However, Beijing has been pressuring Tokyo to have ""negotiations"" on the Senkaku Islands, through coercive measures such as putting a fire-control radar lock on Japanese naval forces, and violating Japan's territorial waters and airspace. Tokyo has tried to reach out to Beijing on various occasions. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sought a meeting with President Xi Jinping at the G20 and Apec [Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation] meetings. Tokyo also sent high-ranking officials to Beijing for discussions on crisis management and strengthening communication. Despite the different claims over the Senkaku Islands, Tokyo believes that the two countries need to develop bilateral relations to ensure regional stability and prosperity. Tokyo will continue to seek opportunities to engage with Beijing. The announcement of China's air defence identification zone (ADIZ) has no legal effect but is an unnecessary provocation. First, it covers the Senkaku Islands, which are under the administration of Japan. Second, it overlaps with Japan's ADIZ. Third, China has announced that all aircraft are obliged to observe Chinese regulations. These measures are totally against international practices. The announcement will simply increase existing tensions in the East China Sea and the chance of clashes. If China implements its ADIZ, it is likely that there will be frequent encounters between Japanese and Chinese fighters in the overlapping zones. It is also likely that Washington will implement the freedom of navigation programme, its policy of asserting its navigational rights, by sending aircraft into China's ADIZ to challenge China's excessive claims. The worst-case-scenario is a collision that could escalate into a larger conflict if managed badly. In order to ease tensions, Beijing should stop its provocative and coercive measures. These measures will not bring any compromise from Tokyo. Instead, Beijing should preserve international laws and norms, and take peaceful measures to resolve the competing claims. Beijing also needs to understand that China can enjoy security and prosperity only under a stable international environment. Beijing should not impede free and fair access to maritime and air spaces. US: Michael Swaine, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Relations have fluctuated somewhat after a very tense period following the Japanese purchase of several of the islands in September 2012. Various incidents have taken place (for example, a Chinese frigate apparently locking its weapons-targeting radar onto a Japanese destroyer in February 2013, an exchange of sharp words over possible overflights of the islands by Chinese drones in October, various sharp exchanges from officials during the year), but leaders on both sides have also indicated that they would like to reduce tensions, and discussions have occurred at various times over possible ways to open talks aimed at reducing tensions. Moreover, the number of incidents prompted by Chinese air and sea incursions near the islands has dropped from the highpoint of late 2012. The latest incident (China's announcement of an ADIZ in the East China Sea) has again increased the level of tension, however, making movement toward tension-reducing talks less likely in at least the short-term. The ADIZ declaration clearly undermines any movement toward a mutual reduction in tension. Despite Chinese protestations to the contrary, the announcement is being viewed by US, Japanese and other observers as provocative and unhelpful. Since the ADIZ encompasses the Senkaku-Diaoyu Islands, it is feared that it could now be used as a justification for more regular intercepts of Japanese aircraft approaching those islands, thus increasing the likelihood of an incident. Equally troublesome, the ADIZ could also be used to justify more aggressive Chinese responses to foreign military aircraft transiting the zone, even when they are not heading toward Chinese airspace. Beijing has thus far sent mixed messages regarding how aggressive it might be, for example, in intercepting foreign military aircraft on surveillance missions within the airspace. Although Beijing has at times in the past sent fighters to intercept such flights along China's coast, sometimes employing aggressive, close-in manoeuvres designed to push back the surveillance aircraft (one such action precipitated the so-called Hainan Incident of 2001 that resulted in the loss of life), the ADIZ might presage a more regular pattern of such interdiction efforts. It is difficult to say how dangerous the situation is at present. Much depends on how Japan and the US react to the announcement through aircraft deployments. The US has already flown two B52s through the zone east of the islands, without incident. But a more serious test would come over US or Japanese surveillance flights through the ADIZ, or when Japan sends fighters into the airspace over the islands. Such actions could prompt a greater-than-usual assertive Chinese response than might have occurred before the ADIZ announcement, which could increase the chances of an incident. And as indicated, much will depend on how the Chinese implement the ADIZ. At the very least, the Chinese need to clarify, authoritatively, how they will treat surveillance aircraft and other potentially ""threatening"" (from their viewpoint) military aircraft that are transiting the zone but not heading toward Chinese airspace. Thus far, Chinese efforts at clarification have been unsuccessful. Asean: Lye Liang Fook, East Asian Institute, National University of Singapore In China's view, Japan altered the status of the islands when it nationalised three of them in September 2012. Since then, apart from trading verbal barbs, the naval and air assets of both countries have routinely ventured near to or into waters off the islands. A new norm seems to have been set whereby both countries ""take turns"" to assert their sovereignty over the islands. Yet China has so far been unsuccessful in getting Japan to admit that the islands are in dispute. Through the announcement of its air defence identification zone (ADIZ), China wants to ratchet up the pressure on Japan. Japan and the US have reacted most strongly. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has described the move as ""totally unacceptable for Japan"". US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel called it a ""destabilising attempt to alter the status quo"". Japan is also eager to work with South Korea (also directly affected by China's ADIZ) and Australia to mount a concerted response. Relations between China and Japan look set to worsen. However, developments are not all gloomy. For one, both China and Japan have kept official and unofficial channels of communications between them open. They have also been able to compartmentalise their dispute. A delegation of senior Japanese business executives called on Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang in Beijing just days ago. In the midst of the furore over China's ADIZ, working-level officials from Japan, China and South Korea met in Tokyo for their third round of free trade talks. While tensions over the islands are high, exchanges in other areas are continuing. Neither Asean [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] nor any of its 10 member states has responded to China's ADIZ. This is not surprising as the resolution of the islands issue primarily rests with China and Japan. However, Asean members do have an interest in regional stability. Their preference seems to be for China and Japan to meet at the negotiating table to sort out any differences rather than for them to constantly test each other at sea or in the air. Even assuming that Chinese and Japanese top leaders do not wish to see the two sides coming to blows, the probability of a miscalculation or mishap happening at sea or in the air increases with any measure or counter-measure introduced, China's ADIZ included. There are some who speculate that China could follow up by introducing a similar ADIZ over disputed parts of the South China Sea (SCS). In particular, China could mark a zone that is in dispute with the Philippines in order to force the latter to withdraw its submission against China at the international arbitration tribunal. If China did so, it is very likely to lose a lot of the credibility that it has painstakingly built up since a fresh set of leaders took the helm this year. More recently, in October 2013, President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang visited five Asean countries and made numerous proposals to further deepen ties. China's key message is that the SCS disputes that it has with some Asean claimant states should not stand in the way of the many lucrative opportunities that China and Asean would benefit from.","A row about disputed islands between China and Japan has raised tensions in East Asia. In the latest development, China has demarcated an air defence identification zone which includes the islands, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, prompting protests from Japan and the US. Five experts give their views."
"The Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) is projected to win almost 60 seats in the 87-seat parliament, local media report. Final results are expected to be declared on Sunday. An MDP win would solidify the comeback of the country's former president and MDP leader Mohamed Nasheed, who was in exile until late last year. Footage posted on the party's official Twitter account shows supporters hugging each other and dancing. ""This [the result] will go a long way in consolidating democracy in the Maldives,"" Mr Nasheed told the BBC. Mr Nasheed became the country's first democratically elected president in 2008. His party campaigned on a platform of reforming the judiciary, upholding freedom of expression and democracy. Mr Nasheed was forced into exile in 2016 following a controversial terrorism conviction during the rule of Abdulla Yameen. He returned after his deputy Mr Solih's unexpected victory in last September's presidential election. 'A remarkable comeback' Analysis by Anbarasan Ethirajan, South Asia Regional Editor Hundreds of supporters of the Maldivian Democratic Party have gathered in the capital Male celebrating the victory. Mohamed Nasheed is leading the celebrations. It's a remarkable comeback for the former president who was forced into exile till late last year following a controversial terrorism conviction. A clear majority will help his Maldivian Democratic Party to consolidate its hold on power and carry out political and economic reforms. The party says it wants to reduce political influence over the judiciary and police and end corruption. The MDP also wants to reduce the country's dependence on China and forge closer ties with its traditional ally, India. During his rule, Mr Yameen jailed many of his political opponents and removed dissenting voices from institutions such as the Supreme Court. Mr Yameen did not stand in the election but his Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM) contested. The election in the Indian Ocean archipelago is also seen as a battleground for regional powers China and India, which are vying for influence in the country. When Mr Yameen was in power, China invested millions of dollars as part of its Belt and Road initiative. The MDP has promised to investigate the infrastructure projects and determine the island's true debt to China. Mr Yameen denies any wrongdoing in relation to the Chinese financial aid.","President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih's party is on course to win a landslide victory in the Maldives parliamentary election, early result show."

"Katty KayPresenter, BBC World News@KattyKayBBCon Twitter Under a candidate this divisive, there's not much room for feeling anything in between, as the realisation dawns that Donald Trump now has a plausible shot at being America's next president. There has never been a candidate for the White House quite like this. He came into the race something of a joke, he conducted his campaign in ways that sometimes seemed like a joke (remember the steaks) but he won the nomination with totally serious conviction, demolishing his large field of competitors. One by one, the primary wins stacked up and the other candidates fell. It was extraordinary to watch. The man almost no-one in the American political world took seriously defied all the predictions. How did he do it? Trump tapped into something we all should have seen, but failed to. For years, working class Americans have suffered from low employment and stagnant wages. They've watched the spread of globalisation, immigration and free trade and they felt left behind. The US economy appeared to boom, but their lives didn't reflect that triumph. They had got a bad deal. Add to that an America that seemed to have faltered on the global stage and a president congenitally averse to nationalistic chest-thumping and Donald Trump was a gift. From the billionaire's New York penthouse, he somehow understood the concerns of less educated Americans, particularly less educated American men. He appeared to have an intuitive understanding of their loves and hates. He even said at one point in this absurdly long campaign that he loved the poorly educated. He knew they felt shackled by political correctness, and he gave them freedom to rail against it. He knew they were afraid that their country was changing around them, increasingly populated by people whose first language was Spanish not English. When he suggested that Mexico was sending rapists across the border, he vindicated those fears. When he proposed to ban all Muslims from America, he gave voice to the anti-Islamic sentiment that's simmered in the US since 9/11. It has been a remarkable display of political instinct from a man who's never been in politics. His supporters are so devoted to him that he could do no wrong. When he said Vietnam torture victim and war vet Senator John McCain wasn't a war hero, his approval ratings went up. When he suggested a female reporter posed a tough question because she was menstruating, his numbers improved again. Mexico, Muslims, Lyin' Ted... they all just fuelled the Trump train. And they love him most because he doesn't sound like all the politicians who have promised much and delivered little. And yet, at the risk of being churlish on the night Mr Trump celebrates a stunning victory, it is worth noting how he has also alienated millions of Americans in a way we have not seen here in modern history. Never has a candidate for the presidency been this reviled and rejected by some members of their own party. There is a long list (literally, you can find it on the website of The Hill newspaper) of Republican politicians and strategists who have said they will never vote for Trump. In private there are many more who have said they will vote for Hillary rather than Donald. These are the people - and I have spoken to many of them - who say their party's candidate is a ""bigot"", ""racist"", ""misogynist"". They call him ""crass"", ""rude"", ""a bully"". Some of these people may now fall in line with the party leadership, hold their nose and tick the Trump box, but they don't like him. If you broaden the surveys out to all Americans, Trump breaks records with his unfavourability ratings. Which is why two groups are cheering tonight, team Trump and team Clinton. The Clinton campaign remains convinced that this is the perfect race for them. They see Trump's negatives and they believe he is the best candidate they could have hoped for as their Republican opponent. Moreover, the demographics of America would suggest that whoever is the Democratic nominee stands an odds-on chance of winning the White House - there are just more Democratic than Republican voters in the country. But this is a curious year, the political rule book has been shredded and Donald Trump hates losing almost more than he loves winning. The Clinton camp would be wrong to get too confident too soon. If we have learned one thing in this crazy campaign, it is that predictions are foolish. Call me a fool, but I'm prepared to make just one more - the Clinton-Trump match-up is going to be brutal. You thought the last 24 hours was ugly. You haven't seen anything yet.","America tonight stands on the doorstep of greatness, or the precipice of doom."
"By Sofia BettizaBBC World Service Nowhere has this been more apparent than in Italy, the first country in Europe to be overwhelmed by the virus in 2020 - and one of the first to impose a national lockdown. On International Nurses Day, healthcare workers there who spoke to the BBC at the start of the pandemic explain how they found ways to cope with the trauma of the last year. 'We carry everything we've seen' ""I never thought I would get my life back,"" says Paolo Miranda, an intensive care nurse in Cremona who last year decided to document the bleak situation inside his unit by taking photographs. The portraits showed how his colleagues were coping after the first wave - as the pandemic became the ""new normal"" and people stopped celebrating them as heroes. ""I never want to forget what happened to us. It will soon become history,"" he told the BBC at the time. ""Although the emergency is slowing down, we feel surrounded by darkness. ""It's like we are full of wounds. We carry everything we've seen inside us."" One major change has happened for Paolo since then - he's become a dad. ""We called our daughter Vittoria, which means victory. Bringing a new life into the world during such a disastrous situation gave us a lot of hope."" Paolo, who says he has post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from the events of the past year, says many of his colleagues have also decided to have children - almost in defiance of all the death and suffering they've had to endure. ""My daughter is helping me so much to deal with burnout. I come home, I look at her, she smiles back… it's wonderful."" 'I had to treat Covid deniers' In February 2020, Italy became the global centre of the pandemic - and a cautionary tale of what happens when a healthcare system in one of the wealthiest parts of the world collapses. At the time, Martina Benedetti, an intensive care nurse in Tuscany, told the BBC she wasn't sure she wanted to be a nurse any more. She's had a change of heart since then, describing her job as ""wonderful"", but warned that it's not for everyone. ""I feel like I have aged 10 years. I used to be carefree and light-hearted… that person is gone."" Writing helped her cope. After a long shift, she'd go home and before bed write down her feelings, which she later turned into an e-book. Martina says it's been particularly hard to deal with patients who denied the existence of Covid - some of whom ended up in her intensive care unit. ""I had to treat people who were inciting others on social media to not wear masks, and called nurses liars."" But Martina said that on some occasions, she managed to change their minds. ""One Covid denier, after they got discharged went on Facebook and wrote the exact opposite of what he used to think. It was a victory for me."" 'I discovered a strength I didn't know I had' A study conducted on Italian nurses by the EngageMinds HUB research centre found those who engaged with their patients showed lower levels of PTSD and burnout. ""Often patients and their relatives are seen as a burden that slows down an emergency response,"" says Dr Serena Barello, one of the authors of the study. ""But taking the time to explain things to them, sharing responsibilities, joy and pain, means there is an extra human resource in your team - and ultimately this makes the job easier."" It also found 90% of those involved in the study never considered leaving their jobs or asking for a transfer during the pandemic - instead they felt an immense sense of pride, a feeling echoed by care home doctor Elisa Nanino. ""The pandemic gave me confirmation that I am in the right job. I discovered a strength I didn't know I had. I saw people die, I cried, but I also saved people's lives. It's priceless."" Elisa says when she got home from work and couldn't switch off, cooking helped her. She would make batches of tiramisu and bring them to her hospital to share with her colleagues. Her biggest piece of advice for healthcare workers is not to feel guilty about those they couldn't save. ""It's simply impossible to save all the sick people that come in front of you during a pandemic. You can only do your best, but don't go home and agonise over it."" For Martina, it was difficult to talk to friends and family because they didn't fully understand what she was going through. She said it was her colleagues who helped her carry on. ""My best piece of advice for nurses out there who are dealing with a crisis is to work as a team,"" she says. ""When you are crumbling, trying to hide it is just a waste of time. You'll get nowhere by yourself. Talk to your colleagues - they are probably going through the same thing."" 'Finding peace of mind again' As a result of the pandemic, Dr Barello worries many nurses and doctors will experience PTSD, which can affect someone months or even years later. ""When you finally have time to reflect on what happened, and society is moving on, it can all come crashing down and you feel more exhausted and emotionally distressed."" She says hospitals have to step up and offer staff the psychological support they need and push them to take care of themselves - including encouraging them to reclaim their private lives, which have completely disappeared for the past year-and-a-half. This could include resuming hobbies that were abandoned, spending time with family, doing sports - especially outdoors. Martina intends to do just that. ""I am planning a trip in the mountains with my husband - somewhere in the middle of nature, isolated, where I can finally find peace of mind again.""","Nurses across the globe have been instrumental in helping fight Covid-19, but it's been a job that has taken a heavy toll - both physically and mentally."
"By Lebo DisekoBBC News Zimbabweans - and many watching around the world - were astounded on Sunday night when Mr Mugabe addressed the nation and said that far from stepping down, he was going to stay on and preside over the ruling party's congress in December. So with Mr Mugabe defiant, and the army insisting that it has not carried out a a coup, what are the options for getting him to vacate his position? Here are five possible scenarios: 1: Impeachment Zanu-PF says it will launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Mugabe when parliament convenes on Tuesday. Impeachment is the process of removing a president via parliament. Both the National Assembly and the Senate can begin proceedings to remove the president if both pass simple majority votes against him. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses in order for impeachment to succeed. Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority in the House of Assembly, but not the Senate. The formal process is expected to start on Tuesday but it is not clear how long it would take. The benefit of this process for the military is that it allows the generals to say the removal of the president was done in accordance with the constitution, in keeping with their statement that this is not a coup. The downside for them is that it does not guarantee that the man widely thought to be their favourite for president will get the top job straight away. Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking prompted the military's action, could not immediately take over from Mr Mugabe, because constitutionally it is the current vice-president who should fill the vacancy. At the moment that person is Phelekezela Mphoko - a man whose sympathies are known to lie with Grace Mugabe, and who was expelled by Zanu-PF on Sunday. Whether the army can persuade Mr Mugabe to appoint their preferred candidate as vice-president before stepping down remains to be seen. Some analysts have argued that this may be what the generals were discussing with him - and it may also be his trump card. But given how difficult it has been to get Mr Mugabe to step down, the chances of getting him to concede further ground look increasingly slim. 2: Mugabe stays on - until December President Mugabe was defiant when he made his televised address on Sunday. Despite having been sacked by Zanu-PF, he said ""the party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". He suggested that he was willing to forgive the military action, and said ""whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns"". It had been reported that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign. It is unclear whether he changed his mind, or if these reports were incorrect. But BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says it makes the military look weak. Some suggest that there may be grounds within Zanu-PF's own rules which might allow Mr Mugabe to reject his sacking by the party. President Mugabe is known for both being shrewd and stubborn. So he may well have another ace up his sleeve. 3. Mugabe forced into exile Initially it had been thought that the military was trying to reach a deal which would allow President Mugabe to stay in Zimbabwe once he had stood down. But the current stalemate makes that look less likely. From the point of view of Mr Mugabe, and his wife, there is a fear that even if he were to be promised immunity from prosecution now, that could be removed by a future government. So it might mean that Mr Mugabe is forced into exile. Until recently, neighbouring South Africa would have been a natural place for him to go. Mr Mugabe enjoys a high level of respect there, in large part because of his support for the fight against apartheid rule. Indeed, the opposition EFF party has called on the government to ""prepare to welcome President Mugabe for political asylum"". The Mugabes are reported to have a number of properties in South Africa. The sticking point would be what happens to Grace. She was granted diplomatic immunity after allegedly assaulting a model in a hotel room in Johannesburg in August. But model Gabriella Engels is trying to get the diplomatic immunity order set aside. If successful, it would mean Mrs Mugabe could face prosecution should she go to South Africa. So if not South Africa, then where? Other possible options are Singapore and Malaysia, where the Mugabes also have properties. 4. Government of national unity and elections The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) party is back in Harare after receiving treatment for cancer in South Africa, fuelling speculation about negotiations for a unity government. This is the scenario that many in the West, and of course the opposition, would prefer. Another opposition leader, Tendai Biti, has said that he would join a national unity government if Mr Tsvangirai was also in it. 5: A new Mugabe? But the military takeover was not a change of regime. It was an internal dispute within Zanu-PF, and that party is still very much in power. The military is to a large extent the armed wing of Zanu-PF. And the man it supports as leader - Emmerson Mnangagwa - helped Robert Mugabe carry out some of his most controversial policies. He is also, some say, more ruthless. So it is far from clear that the ousting of Mr Mugabe would improve the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans.","Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party is planning to support impeachment proceedings against Robert Mugabe, after he ignored a deadline to stand down as president."
"A report by Harvard University, Save the Children and World Vision said almost a third of the buildings in two towns had been damaged or destroyed in government offensives on the opposition's last stronghold. Other images showed fields filling up with camps for displaced people. Almost a million civilians have fled their homes since December alone. Hundreds have also been killed during that period, the vast majority of them victims of attacks by the Syrian government and its allies, according to the United Nations. On Tuesday, the UN's emergency relief co-ordinator warned that the displaced were ""struggling to survive in horrific conditions"", with many forced to sleep in the open. Idlib is the last region still controlled by the jihadists and Turkey-backed rebels who have been trying to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since 2011. In recent years an influx of displaced people has doubled the province's population to about three million, including one million children. A series of satellite images, analysed by the Signal Program at Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, show the impact in two areas of Idlib since 2017 of the offensives launched by the government with the help of Russian air strikes and Iran-backed militiamen. In the areas examined, the researchers estimated that nearly one-third of buildings had been entirely or partially destroyed by aerial bombardment and ground fighting. With inhabitants having fled before or during the government offensive, aid organisations believe the destruction of homes and vital civilian infrastructure will make it almost impossible for families to return to the areas in the near future, according to the report. Other images show two displacement camps in northern Idlib that have almost doubled and tripled in area since September 2017 and February 2020, according to the report. The camps are seen spreading over what was previously agricultural land. In both, population density appears to grow acutely between 2018 and 2019, with significant increases over the past year. ""Relentless bombardment has all but emptied out large parts of Idlib in a matter of weeks, with catastrophic consequences for hundreds of thousands of children and women,"" said Sonia Khush, Syria country director for Save the Children. ""Half a million children are crammed in camps and shelters at the border with Turkey, with no access to the basics of a decent life: a warm place to sleep, clean water, nutritious food and education. Families are being squeezed beyond breaking point and our partners on the ground are overwhelmed by the scale of the needs. ""The world cannot continue to watch and wait while children are killed, injured and displaced on such a massive scale,"" she added. In recent weeks, Turkey has sent thousands of troops into Idlib to support the Syrian opposition, triggering deadly clashes with pro-government forces. On Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will hold talks in Moscow with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. Mr Erdogan has said he aims to broker a ceasefire. .",Analysis of satellite images in the south and east of Syria's Idlib province suggests large parts of the area are now uninhabitable.
"Megumi Igarashi, 42, had allegedly displayed an ""obscene"" work at a Tokyo sex shop and sent 3D data of her genitals to other people. She was arrested in early December and has been held in detention since then. Ms Igarashi was previously arrested in July, but was later released following a legal appeal and public pressure. On Wednesday Ms Igarashi was charged with obscenity for displaying a work modelled on her vagina and for distributing data that could be used to print out a 3D copy of her genitals, reported the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Ms Igarashi, who goes by the name Rokudenashi-ko which means ""no-good girl"" in Japanese, pleaded not guilty. Asahi Shimbun reported that she read out in court a prepared statement which said: ""My works are all meant to induce friendly laughter because they involve cutely decorating sexual organs. The works are not obscene."" Japan's obscenity laws ban the depiction of genitalia, which are blurred in broadcast media and images. If convicted, Ms Igarashi could be jailed up to two years and/or fined as much as 2.5 million yen (£13,350, $20,750). Controversial kayak Ms Igarashi made international headlines in July when she was arrested, after she raised funds online to make a vagina-shaped kayak using a 3D printer. She had sent data that could be used to create 3D models of her vagina to those who had donated to her. She was released after several days following a legal appeal and a petition signed by more than 17,000 people saying her work was art and not obscene, reported Japan Times. But police arrested her again on 3 December on similar grounds. They also arrested the owner of a Tokyo sex shop for allegedly displaying Ms Igarashi's ""obscene goods"" in her shop window from October 2013 until July this year. The woman was later freed after a judge refused to allow prosecutors to question her further. Authorities however were allowed to continue to detain Ms Igarashi because the judge was concerned that she would ""destroy evidence or flee"", said Asahi Shimbun. Her case has sparked debate on the nature of censorship and Japan's obscenity laws. Correspondents say that opinion is split in Japan over whether Ms Igarashi's work is obscene, with some pointing out that images of penises are not seen as causing offence. On her website, Ms Igarashi, who has made several items based on her genitals using a silicone mould, said she wanted to make vaginas ""more casual and pop"", much like how penises are regarded as ""part of pop culture"" in Japan.","A Japanese woman who makes art based on her vagina has been charged with obscenity, in a case that has sparked discussion on censorship."
"By Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent A gay man and the son of an Indian immigrant doctor, he helped the Republic of Ireland achieve its Brexit goals and avoid a hard border on the island. That success, he and many others believe, helps to cement the Irish peace process and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement after decades of civil unrest in Northern Ireland and more than 3,000 murders. But like many politicians, he has found to his cost that he may be more popular abroad than he is at home. The Fine Gael leader may have been celebrated for his role in embodying the liberalisation of a country that was once regarded as one of the most socially conservative in Europe. But it remains to be seen if his achievements on abortion rights for women and playing a leading role on marriage equality will count much for voters in the 2020 general election. It is true that the Irish economy is in a very healthy place with virtual full employment, but recent polls suggest the electorate wants change after nine years of Fine Gael government and action on housing, homelessness and the health system. In the interview in which he publicly announced he was gay, he also said that he didn't want to make politics a life-time vocation. Mr Varadkar was born in Dublin on the 18 January 1979. His father Ashok, a Hindu doctor from Mumbai, met his mother, Miriam, an Irish nurse from Waterford, while they were both working in Slough in Berkshire. They settled in Ireland in the 1970s and although the young Leo was raised a Catholic, he was sent to a fee-paying private Church of Ireland school. He followed in his father's footsteps and qualified as a doctor; Mr Varadkar's partner, Matt Barrett, is also a doctor. But Leo Varadkar always appeared more interested in politics than medicine. As a young man, he was seen as being quite right-wing but moved more towards the centre ground as his political career progressed. 'Straight talker' In 2007, he was elected to the Irish parliament, Dáil Éireann, and held a series of ministries, including health, before succeeding Enda Kenny as Fine Gael leader and taoiseach in 2017. As part of his leadership campaign he was criticised for promising to champion ""those who get up early in the morning""; it was seen as a dig against those on social welfare. But for his admirers, it was further proof that their man was a straight talker. At 38, Leo Varadkar became Ireland's youngest taoiseach and was seen as part of a new dynamic group of world leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Irish voters did not give him a personal mandate when he was elected taoiseach in a party vote in 2017. With Brexit, in his words, ""still only at half-time"", he's still young enough to return as taoiseach.","As taoiseach (Irish prime minister), Leo Varadkar has probably had a higher international profile than any of his predecessors."
"He spoke at a Catholic shrine dedicated to Christians martyred for their faith in the 19th Century, on the second stage of his three-country Africa tour. The Mass marks the 50th anniversary of the martyrs' canonisation. After the mass he addressed thousands of young people, encouraging them to turn to their faith when faced with difficulties. There were huge cheers as the Pope began the open-air ceremony at Namugongo, near the capital Kampala. It was where many of the 45 Anglican and Catholic martyrs were burned alive. Their execution was ordered by a king worried about the spread of Christianity. Thousands of pilgrims braved rain to spend the night holding a vigil near the martyrs' shrines and there were long lines of pilgrims still trying to access the shrine as Pope Francis addressed the crowds on Saturday morning. The Pope's five big issues in Africa After the mass more than 150,000 young Ugandans gathered on the outskirts of Kampala for the Pope's other public event of the day. Pope Francis urged them to use their faith to confront life's difficulties and turn negative experiences into strength. Uganda is a deeply religious country, with over 14.1 million Catholics - and even adherents of other faiths will be paying close attention to the Pope's words, say correspondents. He arrives here during the third week of a presidential campaign being fought by the country's ruler for the past 29 years, President Yoweri Museveni. At the scene - Caroline Wyatt, BBC religious correspondent The Pope's message against corruption, and the need to care for the poor, is being welcomed by ordinary people here, in a place where some say corruption does much to damage the economy, and little to help people out of poverty. Uganda ranks 142nd out of 175 countries on Transparency International's corruption perception index. Gay rights activists in Uganda have expressed their disappointment that the Vatican did not respond to their request for a meeting with the Pope. Openly gay Ugandans face many difficulties in everyday life, with many churches here preaching against homosexuality and encouraging homophobia. A Ugandan law, originally passed when the country was a British colony, still allows the authorities to pass a sentence of life imprisonment for gay people caught having sex. There have been some critical references to the Pope's visit on Twitter - with some wondering ""how many people have HIV today because contraception isn't allowed?"" while others accused him of ignoring extreme anti-gay attitudes in Uganda. On Friday, the Pope addressed an audience of young people in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, urging them to unite and take a stand against the destructive effects of tribalism. He will travel to the Central African Republic (CAR), which has been hit by serious violence between Christian and Muslim militias in recent years, on Sunday.

"The plan does not match the ""standards"" of US presidents over the last 40 years, Walter Shaub said. A Trump lawyer said earlier the new trust would face ""severe restrictions"" on new deals. But Mr Shaub said the plan would not remove conflicts of interest. ""Every president in modern times has taken the strong medicine of divestiture,"" he said, referring to a process whereby Mr Trump would sell off his corporate assets and put the profits into a blind trust run by an independent trustee. At a news conference on Wednesday, lawyer Sherri Dillon said that management of the Trump Organization would be transferred to a trust controlled by Mr Trump's sons Don and Eric and chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. The Trump Organization is an umbrella company for Donald Trump's hundreds of investments in real estate, brands and other businesses. In other developments: Anthony Zurcher: Theatre of the absurd Paul Wood: How and why did we get here? Outlining a structure designed by her and colleagues at the law firm Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, Ms Dillon said President-elect Trump wanted Americans to have no doubt that he was ""completely isolating himself from his business interests"". The trio in charge ""will make decisions for the duration of the presidency without any involvement whatsoever by President-elect Trump"", she said. No foreign deals will be made and domestic deals will be subject to ""vigorous vetting"", she added. Soon after, Mr Shaub said that the arrangement would not remove conflicts of interest for Mr Trump since, unlike in a blind trust, he would still see information about the businesses and deals being made in the newspapers and on television. ""His sons are still running the businesses and, of course, he knows what he owns,"" he said at the Brookings Institution think tank in Washington DC. Describing Mr Trump's plan as ""wholly inadequate"", he said: ""Nothing short of divestiture will resolve these conflicts."" 10 things we learnt from Trump press event Trump press conference: Full transcript A whirlwind of condemnation: analysis by John Mervin, BBC News, New York If Mr Trump and his lawyers thought this was going to satisfy the ethical and constitutional concerns that have been raised, they'll need to think again. ""As I listened, my jaw dropped. Trump's workaround is a totally fraudulent runaround,"" tweeted Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard University, one of the leading constitutional lawyers in the US. ""Trump's announced structure is cleverly designed to dazzle and deceive, but it solves none of the serious ethical or legal issues. Trump's lawyer would flunk constitutional law at any halfway decent law school. At least if the lawyer wasn't just joking."" The biggest objection arises from the so called emoluments clause of the US constitution. It expressly forbids anyone in government from receiving gifts or benefits (""emoluments"") from foreign powers. If Donald Trump still owns his companies, then even if he's not managing them, the argument goes, he will still be the beneficiary of many of the Trump Organization's foreign businesses. Professor Richard Painter, who was President George W Bush's chief ethics lawyer, stated frankly: ""The plan we heard today does not comply with the law."" Professor Norman Eisen, who did the same job for President Obama, agreed with that and also offered an ominous forecast for the president-elect. ""What Donald J Trump has done today is contrary to the most fundamental law of the United States of America,"" he said. ""The emoluments clause is no minor feature of the constitution... So these conflicts of interest are core. I do not believe that any of the branches of government will stand for it."" A list of Trump's potential conflicts The ethics agency director compared the Trump plan with what he characterised as secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson's successful efforts to make a ""clean break"" from Exxon, where he was chairman and chief executive. ""He clearly recognises that public service sometimes comes at a cost,"" Mr Shaub said of Mr Tillerson. Although presidents are not subject to the same conflict of interest rules as other government employees, previous commanders-in-chief have placed their investments into a blind trust to prevent any question of corruption. The Office of Government Ethics was set up in 1978 to monitor how the US executive and its agencies comply with rules on gifts, nepotism and conflicts of interest. It is not responsible for enforcing those rules or handling complaints, but can refer matters to law-enforcement agencies - including the FBI - or to the justice department. Mr Shaub said the OGE was waiting to assist Mr Trump if he decided to ""adjust his plan"".",The director of the US Office of Government Ethics has criticised Donald Trump's plan to hand control of his business empire to his sons before his inauguration on 20 January.
"Authorities have distributed food, fuel and blankets to the drivers on the Kanetsu expressway, which connects the capital Tokyo to Niigata, in the north. The snow, which began on Wednesday evening, has caused multiple traffic jams along the road. It has also left more than 10,000 homes in the north and west without power. A Kyodo News report said that there were multiple reports of congestion at different points of the Kanetsu expressway. The gridlock began when a trailer got stuck in snow on Wednesday night. Another Kyodo report, quoting police and highway operator East Nippon Expressway Co, said the traffic jam had stretched up to 16.5km (10 miles) along the road at one point. Officials have been using a combination of heavy machinery and physical labour to dig out the vehicles one by one, but around 1,000 cars were still stranded on the road as of Friday noon. ""We are trying our best to rescue drivers and passengers, we are ready to continue the operation through the night,"" a Niigata disaster management official told AFP on Thursday night. Another similar traffic jam also occurred in the nearby Joshinetsu Expressway which saw 300 vehicles stranded. That gridlock lasted from Wednesday to Thursday morning. According to the meteorological agency, the heavy snow - said to be this year's most intense cold spell - is expected to continue through the weekend. The country's prime minister Yoshihide Suga has called an emergency cabinet meeting and urged the public to be cautious. The snow storm comes as Japan is battling a third wave of coronavirus cases, which has put unprecedented pressure on the country's hospitals.","Rescuers are trying to free more than 1,000 vehicles which have been stranded on a highway for two days after a heavy snow storm struck Japan."
"Mr Abe condemned the North for ""repeated launches of ballistic missiles"" after two projectiles were fired on Thursday. But the North insisted it was testing a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"". On Saturday, state media said Japan ""may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future"". North Korea is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions. The country is under various sets of sanctions over its missile and nuclear programmes. Lifting the sanctions has been a key aim of the North in talks with the US - Japan's ally - but these have stalled since a summit between its leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump broke down in February. What's the latest spat about? The North fired what observers in South Korea called two ""unidentified projectiles"" from its South Hamgyong province into the Sea of Japan on Thursday. Condemning the launch, Mr Abe said: ""North Korea's repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community."" The North issued photographs said to be of Mr Kim inspecting the launch. North Korea's KCNA state media said on Saturday: ""It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from a multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report."" It added: ""Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose. Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf."" Who's right? Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said neither side was necessarily right. The projectile is believed to have been a KN-25, a rocket many analysts consider to be a ""ballistic missile"" due to its large size, and because it follows an unpowered ballistic trajectory for part of its flight. ""The North Koreans are playing a semantics game, basically, and by the same token so is Abe,"" said the MIT specialist. ""When he said ballistic missile he's clearly trying to signify these tests are a violation of UN Security Council resolutions,"" he told the BBC. ""North Korea is saying ... it's a multi-launch rocket system, which is different from a ballistic missile."" But the bigger story, the security expert added, is that North Korea could be preparing for longer-range ballistic missile launches. ""The bigger line... is that Abe may soon see a ballistic missile under his nose. It seems to suggest that they are gearing up to start testing longer-range systems,"" he said. Where are we with talks? Negotiations between North Korea and the US remain stalled since the collapse of February's summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim did meet again in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas in June and agreed to restart working-level talks. These began in October, but failed to make any progress. The North has demanded the US change its approach by the end of the year, and was lukewarm in response to a tweet by Mr Trump hinting at another meeting with Mr Kim. In May, Mr Abe said he was ready to meet Mr Kim ""without conditions"", raising hopes of renewed negotiations on the nuclear issue as well as on the lingering historical issue of the North's abduction of Japanese citizens. The Japanese were kidnapped by the North in the 1970s and 80s to help train its spies. Japan believes 17 citizens were abducted, only five of whom have since been repatriated. But Mr Abe's offer has not come to fruition. The North said this month that the Japanese leader would never set foot in Pyongyang after he condemned an earlier weapons test.","North Korea has branded Japan's PM Shinzo Abe an ""imbecile"" and ""political dwarf"", accusing him of mislabelling its latest weapons test."
"There have been reports of fresh arrivals in the last two weeks since a rebel alliance seized power, it said. Most of the refugees have gone to the north of the Democratic Republic of Congo, others to Chad and Cameroon. President Francois Bozize himself fled to Cameroon when the rebels captured the capital, Bangui. The Seleka rebels, an alliance of armed groups, seized power after a peace deal negotiated with Mr Bozize collapsed. Those who have fled are mainly from Bangui, as well as the cities of Bangassou, Rifai and Zemio in the south-eastern part of the country bordering DR Congo, the UN refugee agency said in a statement. ""Many left their homes in a hurry and were unable to bring personal belongings with them. People are either without places to live or being accommodated by local families - who themselves live in extreme poverty,"" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards said. Over the last four months, another 173,000 people have became internally displaced because of the unrest. Regional heads of state at an emergency summit on the CAR this week refused to recognise the rebel leader, Michel Djotodia. Following the summit, South Africa said it was withdrawing about 200 troops stationed in Bangui, after 13 of their soldiers died in the rebellion. On Thursday, South Africa's defence minister said the South African troops had not anticipated that the rebels would be armed with mortars and other heavy weapons. Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said there had been child soldiers in the rebel ranks and that the South Africans had fought them, as one could not blow kisses and hand out sweets to an armed child. She added that South African troops had not helped the president to flee, or provided him with protection.","The number of people who have fled from the Central Africa Republic has risen to 37,000 since the start of a rebellion in December, the UN has said."
"Leading US and English-language Chinese newspaper websites have been assessing the impact of the historic talks, held in California on Friday and Saturday. Below is a selection of their reporting of the summit. US media Under the headline, ""Obama and Xi try building a new model for US-China ties"", the New York Times says that ""for all the advance talk of the informality of the meetings"" the two leaders ""largely followed well-established diplomatic routine"" with spontaneity limited by the ""necessary translations"". The Times says there was progress in a number of areas of mutual concern, but a familiar sticking point remained. ""Even as they pledged to build ""a new model"" of relations, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China ended two days of informal meetings here on Saturday moving closer on pressuring a nuclear North Korea and addressing climate change, but remaining sharply divided over cyber-espionage and other issues that have divided the countries for years."" The Washington Post leads its main report on what it describes as a ""high-stakes and unusual summit"", with the issue of cyber attacks. ""President Obama confronted Chinese President Xi Jinping here Saturday with specific evidence of China's widespread theft of intellectual property from US companies and warned the newly minted Chinese leader that continued ­cybertheft would undermine economic ties between the rival nations..."" the paper says. The LA Times highlights the US president's own, brief, assessment of the talks: ""Obama gave a one-word summary of the summit Saturday, his only public comment of the day. ""'Terrific,'"" he replied when a reporter asked how the meetings had gone, as he and Xi strolled for 50 minutes by a pond and then sat together on a redwood bench that Obama presented to his guest."" In common with others, the paper also focuses on a summit ""notable for its dress code"". ""No one wore neckties, a testament to the oven-like heat and carefully scripted informality of the presidents' first meeting since Xi assumed office in March,"" the LA Times says. ""Some China watchers and historians say they were struck by how Xi seemed to move comfortably like a Western leader, not only in loosening his collar but also in how he seemed to stroll at ease with Obama as the two leaders engaged with each other."" Meanwhile, NBC News reports that the two-day talks were ""said to have been a warm and laid-back counterpoint to the oftentimes frigid and tense relationship between the two global superpowers"". In an article published ahead of the talks, the Wall Street Journal notes that ""Mr Xi pushed for the summit and agreed to the informal format despite Chinese leaders' usual preference for highly scripted talking points approved in advance by China's top decision-making body, the Politburo Standing Committee"". ""Mr Xi himself drew parallels with the 1972 meeting between Chairman Mao Zedong and President Richard Nixon in Beijing, which laid the ground for the normalization of relations six years later,"" the paper adds. Chinese media The Xinhua news agency leads its coverage with views on the talks from Yang Jiechi, Mr Xi's senior foreign policy advisor, who focused on the changing relationship between the two powers. According to Mr Yang, ""Xi summarized the concept of new type relations between the two nations in three phrases: 'no conflict and no confrontation', 'mutual respect' and 'cooperation toward win-win results'. The paper added, again quoting Mr Yang, that: ""Obama responded actively to the proposal, saying that the US side placed high importance on its relations with China and is willing to construct a new state-to-state cooperation modal with China based on mutual benefit and mutual respect, so as to jointly meet various global challenges."" The South China Morning Post has a slightly different take to the US media on the subject of cyber-espionage. It says: ""Obama, facing pressure from US politicians and businessmen, said he discussed cybersecurity with Xi, but the two sides avoided a direct public confrontation on the issue."" Elsewhere, the paper notes: ""Observers said the initial talks suggested the leaders had made a decent start on fostering a personal relationship, but both sides still needed time to figure out their ""new model"" of relations."" The Global Times highlighted comments from Mr Xi on Friday where he said he ""elaborated the Chinese dream to Obama"". Global Times quotes the Chinese president as saying: ""Through the Chinese dream, we seek to have economic prosperity, national renewal and the people's well-being. The Chinese dream is about peace, development, cooperation and win-win results, and it is connected to the American dream and beautiful dreams of people in other countries."" The People's Daily recalls the ""historic handshake across the Pacific"" between US President Nixon and Chairman Mao in Beijing in 1972. ""While there have been ups and downs over the four decades that have elapsed since the Mao-Nixon meeting, fundamental changes have added impetus to the development of Sino-US relations, turning from 'external demand' to 'domestic demand'"", the paper says. ""At the time of their mutual opposition to the Soviet threat, the forces that drove China and the United States closer to each other were passive. Today, as ties between the two countries grow, the impetus behind their rapprochement is an active and sober call from the heart."" ""Asia has become one of the centres of his [President Obama's] new blueprint, and China happens to be the biggest nation in this region. How to get along with China? This is a question that will put the United States to the test.""","US President Barack Obama and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have ended a two-day summit described by a US official as ""unique, positive and constructive""."

Airport Director Colin Le Ray said the weather had impacted on the airport itself, as well as on passengers trying to get in and away.

"By Pavel AksenovBBC Russian, Vostochny A technician standing behind me was really nervous during the launch countdown at Vostochny, a new space centre in Russia's Far East. It was the second launch attempt - a day after the previous one had been aborted at the last minute. I noticed that some of the technician's colleagues also had pale faces and had crossed their fingers. It emerged later that a cable malfunction had led to the postponement of Wednesday's launch. This time there was relief for Russia's federal space agency, Roscosmos, as the Soyuz rocket, carrying three satellites, blasted off and the booster stage separated. President Vladimir Putin had travelled 5,500km (3,500 miles) to watch the launch and was in a black mood after Wednesday's cancellation, berating Vostochny's managers for the financial scandals that have blighted this prestige project. As the rocket soared away from Earth the tension evaporated - the crowd around me was laughing, hugging, drinking champagne. Only the essential launchpad structures have been finished at Vostochny, which is still a big building site. The original plan was to have it all ready by December 2015. When we inspected the launchpad later it appeared to be in good shape. A huge metal covering for the service cabin had plunged onto a concrete chute for the rocket exhaust gases. But a specialist insisted that the damage was not serious. Hours earlier President Putin had warned of consequences for the management failures at Vostochny. ""If their guilt is proven, they will have to change their warm beds at home for plank-beds in prison,"" Mr Putin said, commenting on the arrest of four senior people involved in the project. Only hours after Vostochny's first launch one of those managers received a three-year jail sentence for massive embezzlement. Strategic move Vostochny is a pet project for Mr Putin. Russia's ambition is to develop it as the main civilian space centre, eventually replacing Baikonur, the Soviet-era cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Baikonur has potential political risks, being outside Russia. So Vostochny has political and propaganda significance: it must prove that, despite international sanctions and a struggling economy, Russia can still complete a new cosmodrome and run it efficiently. The next day I asked Roscosmos head Igor Komarov how he had felt before the second, successful, launch attempt. ""How do you think I felt?"" he answered, grim-faced. The authorities were so nervous that they banned all live broadcasting before the launch and for the 10 minutes after lift-off. But Roscosmos officials have spoken optimistically about Vostochny becoming a centre for international space co-operation in future. The Plesetsk cosmodrome, in Russia's Arctic north, will remain the centre for military space launches. Away from the launchpad, much of the infrastructure at Vostochny remains unfinished. The engineers are in no hurry now; the next launch will not take place until next year.","""Oh please, darling, fly!"""
"The current airport, which is only able to handle limited daytime flights, was not sufficient, Mr Humala said. The government will invest $460m (£290m) in the project, he said. Machu Picchu is Peru's top tourist attraction but there are concerns over the impact of high visitor numbers. ""This new airport will not only mean more tourists will be able to come, but it will generate more jobs... and help surrounding communities,"" President Humala said. At a ceremony on Wednesday, he enacted a law that allows the expropriation of land in the town of Chinchero where the new international airport would be built. The investment would help the government to tackle poverty, he said, ""while always respecting ancient culture"". Tourism is the main source of income in the region. Machu Picchu is a world heritage site and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco, has previously warned about uncontrolled access and urged the authorities to make conservation a priority. Currently, entrance to Machu Picchu is limited to some 2,500 visitors a day, amid concerns about the impact on the environment and citadel. Cusco is the main starting point for visitors wishing to visit the site, who can make the 112km (70 mile) journey either on foot or via bus and train. The citadel of Machu Picchu, located 2,500m (8,200ft) above sea level, was built in the 15th Century by the Incas. It was rediscovered in 1911 by US historian Hiram Bingham.",Peru's President Ollanta Humala has unveiled plans for a new airport near Cusco which he says will boost tourism to the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu and the surrounding region.
"The 27 member states will have to provide Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) bodies for all business sectors, including impartial dispute mediators. Euro MPs approved the ADR regulation on Tuesday, as well as a regulation for disputes over online purchases. The rules say any dispute should be resolved within 90 days. They are to take effect in two years' time. Some EU countries already have such mechanisms for aggrieved shoppers, but the idea is to standardise the complaints procedure in Europe, as people are increasingly making cross-border purchases of goods and services. MEPs backed the regulations overwhelmingly. They included provisions to make the arbitration either free of charge or costing only a minimal fee. The idea is to avoid costly court cases. The rules will not replace existing customer complaint systems run by companies.",The EU has adopted new standard rules to settle disputes between consumers and traders out of court.
"By Daniel SchweimlerBBC News, Buenos Aires Just how big will only become apparent in the next few days and weeks since the former president, neither a great public speaker nor particularly charismatic, operated largely behind the scenes. He won the presidency in 2003 as Argentina was emerging from a deep political and economic crisis, defaulting on a massive foreign debt and with hundreds of thousands of Argentines plunged below the poverty line. Nestor Kirchner, of mixed German and Croatian descent, grew up in the far southern town of Rio Gallegos. As a result his followers were nicknamed ""Penguins"". He became town mayor and then provincial governor. As president, he presided over a country emerging from crisis, helped enormously by a fast expanding soya industry. But his relationship with the powerful agricultural lobby was always a difficult one. He accused many of them of being sympathetic to the brutal military government that terrorised Argentina between 1976 and 1983. He and his wife, Cristina, hinted that they were victims of that regime and worked tirelessly to resume prosecutions of those accused of human rights violations during that period. But they never shook off allegations that they, working as lawyers in Rio Gallegos, had benefited financially under military rule. They certainly enjoyed great wealth, with properties all over Argentina and an especially luxurious holiday home in the Patagonian town of Calafate, which was where he was when he suffered his fatal heart attack. Mr Kirchner surprised many when he stood aside to allow his wife to run as candidate in the 2007 presidential elections. The Argentine constitution allows just two consecutive four-year terms in office and it was widely expected that he would stand in 2011. With a weak and fragmented opposition, Mr and Mrs Kirchner could have alternated in the presidency for the foreseeable future. His influence did not diminish once he stood down. Nestor Kirchner took over as leader of the powerful Peronist party, he became a deputy in the Argentine parliament and was elected secretary general of the new South American regional group, Unasur. Mr Kirchner enjoyed powerful trade union support and enjoyed a close relationship with the region's left wing leaders, especially Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. His relationship with the then US President, George Bush, was always cold - they barely recognised one another's existence. Despite his popular support and his influential contacts, Nestor Kirchner's weak point had long been his health. With shadows under his eyes and a pale complexion, he never looked very healthy. He had already been taken to hospital twice this year, the last time in September for a heart by-pass operation. But within days, he was back on his feet, appearing with Cristina at political rallies, seemingly ignoring the pleas of his doctors to take it easy. The tributes have been flooding in from both former friends and foes. The Vice-President, Julio Cobos, with whom Mr Kirchner had a prickly relationship, called him a great president. The President of Brazil, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, said he was greatly saddened. The Venezuelan President, Hugo Chavez, said Mr Kirchner had gone when he still had so much to give. Flags are flying at half-mast and acts of mourning are being organised across Argentina. But the process has already begun of assessing exactly what Nestor Kirchner contributed to Argentina - both positive and negative. He polarised opinion but what none will deny is that with his death, a huge void has been left in Argentina's political landscape.",The death of Nestor Kirchner will leave a huge void in Argentine politics.
"The measure, which contains a number of exemptions, is to last for 60 days and then could be extended, he said. Mr Trump says the order is designed to protect American workers' jobs in an economy pummelled by the coronavirus. Critics have accused him of using the pandemic as cover to ram through long-sought hardline immigration policies in an election year. ""This will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens,"" Mr Trump said during Wednesday's coronavirus briefing at the White House. Who will lose out and who is exempt? The measure is expected to stop the practice of green card holders sponsoring their extended families for permanent US residency, which the president calls chain migration. But it makes an exception for American citizens' spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21. The order also suspends the Diversity Visa Lottery, which issues about 50,000 green cards annually. Also exempt are the hundreds of thousands of green card applicants already living and working in the US, and those seeking entry to work as doctors, nurses or other healthcare professionals. Another exception is the hundreds of thousands of temporary guest visas issued each year to such applicants as farm labourers and skilled workers in the H-1B visa programme. What will be the impact? The pandemic has blunted the immediate effect of the order because almost all visa processing by the state department has been halted for weeks with consulates closed. Nevertheless, according to the the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, Mr Trump's order could block more than 20,000 applicants per month from obtaining a green card. Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, said the policy ""will cause real pain for families and employers across the country"". The president's move is likely to face legal challenges. What are green cards? How did we get here? The president vowed to suspend ""all immigration"" to the US on in a tweet on Monday night. Like many other nations, the US has imposed sweeping travel restrictions to contain the pandemic. The Trump administration has limited visitors from China and most of Europe, while closing its borders to all but ""essential"" travel from Mexico and Canada. The president has also invoked a 1944 law aimed at preventing the spread of communicable diseases to turn away asylum seekers at US borders. Why is Trump doing this? The president says he is seeking to protect American jobs. More than 20 million Americans have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus outbreak, and the president has said the government had a ""solemn duty"" to ensure they regain work. Mr Trump, a Republican, came into office partly because of his hardline stance on immigration, and has made the issue central to his presidency. In November's election, he is expected to be challenged by former Vice-President Joe Biden, a Democrat who is much more in favour of immigration. Others have accused the president of trying to distract attention from his response to the coronavirus. The US has seen more than 46,000 deaths and 840,000 infections, the most in the world. Also on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he disagreed with moves from some southern states to ease restrictions and reopen their economies. South Carolina has allowed shops including department stores to reopen, and Georgia's Governor Brian Kemp has said gyms, hairdressers and some other services will be free to operate from Friday. Most businesses in Tennessee will reopen on May 1. The Republican governors of all three states have said social distancing measures will remain in place. ""It's just too soon. I think it's too soon,"" Mr Trump said of Georgia's decision. ""They can wait a little bit longer, just a little bit - not much. Because safety has to predominate.""",US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to temporarily suspend the approval of some green cards.
"Coffins representing two men and two women who resisted the Nazis in World War Two were carried through the French capital before being interred. The coffins contained only soil from the fighters' graves as their relatives did not want their bodies disturbed. French President Francois Hollande said the group ""embodied the spirit of the Resistance"". A ceremony was held at the Pantheon alongside the coffins of Germaine Tillion, Genevieve de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Pierre Brossolette and Jean Zay. Tillion, who died in 2008, and de Gaulle-Anthonioz, a niece of former French leader Charles de Gaulle who died in 2002, were caught and deported to the Ravensbruck concentration camp in Germany. Brossolette, a radio journalist who broadcast on the BBC during the war, committed suicide after being arrested and tortured in 1944. Zay, who was minister of education before the war, was killed in 1944, having tried to set up a government-in-exile in north Africa. ""Faced with the occupation, with submission, they gave the same response,"" Mr Hollande said. ""They said 'no', immediately, firmly, clearly."" Mr Hollande drew parallels with those who marched in French cities on January 11 this year, days after terror attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and a kosher supermarket. The induction now sees three women interred at the Pantheon, after the scientist Marie Curie. There are now 74 men interred at the mausoleum, the first being the writer Victor Hugo.",France has honoured four members of the French Resistance with a ceremony at the Pantheon mausoleum in Paris.
"The Electoral Commission said Anna Kanopatskaya of the United Civil Party (UCP) won one of the 110 seats being contested in the lower house. Lawmakers loyal to hard-line President Alexander Lukashenko are expected to occupy most remaining seats. Opposition candidates were able to enter more easily than earlier votes. The opposition's participation in the election is a concession to Western calls for more transparency in Belarus, correspondents say. External monitors were also given access to the vote count. Observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States - a grouping of former Soviet republics - said the elections were open and transparent. However, UCP deputy leader Lev Margolin told the BBC he did not consider the polls to be fair. During the election campaign, he said, a number of opposition candidates had faced media censorship and that, although speeches had been recorded for broadcast, they were not shown. There were also big questions about how the local electoral commission had been formed and the counting process itself, Mr Margolin added. Relations between the West and Belarus have warmed since the president freed all remaining political prisoners after his landslide re-election in October and his move to host peace talks between Ukraine and Russia. The president, in power since 1994, has kept Belarus strategically close to Russia but the relationship became more strained following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 - since then he has made overtures to the West. Independent candidate Elena Anisim, who has links to the opposition, was also reported to have been elected. ""We've done everything so that there aren't complaints from the Western side. We accommodated their requests,"" President Lukashenko told reporters after casting his vote on Sunday in Minsk. The last parliamentary elections in 2012 were boycotted by the two main opposition parties. Of the 448 candidates running this time, 200 were from opposition parties. The European Union ended five years of sanctions against Belarus in February, while the US has also relaxed some of its restrictions, saying that more will be dropped if Sunday's vote is fairly handled by the authorities. An economic downturn in Russia allied to declining energy prices and sanctions have battered former Soviet countries including Belarus, where the economy retracted by nearly 4% in 2015.

"The allegations come from Cohen's new book, Disloyal: A Memoir, written during his jail term for Trump campaign finance violations, among other crimes. Cohen claims Mr Trump also made racist comments about Nelson Mandela and Hispanics. The White House says Cohen is lying. ""Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress,"" press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement at the weekend. ""He has lost all credibility, and it's unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies."" In the book, Cohen alleges that Mr Trump is ""guilty of the same crimes"" that landed him in prison, and calls his former boss ""a cheat, a liar, a fraud, a bully, a racist, a predator, a conman"". He said he had the mentality of a ""mob boss"". Various US news outlets have published quotes from the book, which comes out on Tuesday. Here are some of the key claims. On black people and Mandela ""As a rule, Trump expressed low opinions of all black folks, from music to culture and politics,"" Cohen writes in his book. He claimed Donald Trump said the late South African president and anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela was ""no leader"". ""Tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a shithole. They are all complete [expletive] toilets,"" Mr Trump once said, according to Cohen. The words echo similar allegations, from 2018, that Trump referred to African countries as ""shithole"" nations. Back then, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I am not a racist. I'm the least racist person you have ever interviewed."" Racism accusations have marred his first term and continue to be an issue as the Republican president campaigns for a November re-election against his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. The Nelson Mandela foundation has responded to the allegations regarding the former South Africa president affectionately known as Madiba. ""We do not believe that leaders who conduct themselves in the way Mr Trump does are in a position to offer authoritative commentary on the life and work of Madiba,"" it said in a statement. ""Reflecting on leadership, Madiba once said: 'A good leader can engage in a debate frankly and thoroughly, knowing that at the end he and the other side must be closer, and thus emerge stronger. You don't have that idea when you are arrogant, superficial, and uninformed.' We would recommend these words to Mr Trump for consideration."" On Obama In the book, Cohen alleges that Mr Trump has ""hatred and contempt"" for his predecessor, Barack Obama. ""Trump hired a 'Faux-Bama' to participate in a video in which Trump 'ritualistically belittled the first black president and then fired him',"" Cohen writes. US media has since shown an old video, showing Mr Trump reprising his role as the host of The Apprentice television show and firing a man posing as President Obama. It is believed to have been made for the 2012 Republican convention, when Mitt Romney was nominated as the Republican candidate, but it was never aired. On Hispanic voters According to Cohen, Mr Trump once said: ""I will never get the Hispanic vote. Like the blacks, they're too stupid to vote for Trump. They're not my people."" His comments on Latin Americans have come under scrutiny throughout his presidency, especially after he repeatedly disparaged Mexicans during his campaign. In 2019, President Trump told a rally in New Mexico: ""Nobody loves Hispanics more."" On evangelicals Cohen says that after Mr Trump met with evangelical leaders at Trump Tower shortly after he won the election, he turned and said: ""Can you believe people believe that [expletive]?"" Mr Trump has heavily courted the evangelical vote and has said he is a deep believer himself. His vice-president, Mike Pence, is a devout evangelical. On Putin Donald Trump admired Russian President Vladimir Putin because he was able ""to take over an entire nation and run it like it was his personal company - like the Trump Organization, in fact,"" Cohen writes. Cohen says Mr Trump was sycophantic to President Putin to ensure access to Russian money if he lost the 2016 election. However, Cohen also says that Trump's campaign was ""far too chaotic and incompetent to actually conspire with the Russian government"" when it got into power. On Stormy Daniels In 2016, Cohen arranged a hush-money payment to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had an affair with Mr Trump. The payment, which violated campaign funding rules, was among the crimes that led to Cohen's jail term. Cohen has long insisted he was acting on the president's orders, but Mr Trump has always denied this. ""It never pays to settle these things, but many, many friends have advised me to pay,"" Mr Trump said, according to Cohen's book. ""If it comes out, I'm not sure how it would play with my supporters. But I bet they'd think it's cool that I slept with a porn star."" Who is Michael Cohen? Cohen worked closely with Mr Trump for years and was often known as his ""fixer"", but they fell out and Cohen gave a brutal testimony to Congress last year, prior to Mr Trump's impeachment. In 2018, Cohen was jailed for tax evasion, false statements and campaign finance violations. The disbarred lawyer is currently serving what remains of his three-year sentence at his home in New York, having been released from prison amid concerns about the spread of coronavirus. He was briefly returned to jail, until a federal judge intervened and ruled that the government had made the move in retaliation for him writing his book. Mr Trump has called Cohen ""a rat"" and a liar. Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Donald Trump. He has since said he has received death threats from Trump supporters.","Donald Trump behaves like a mobster and has ""a low opinion of all black people"", according to the US president's former lawyer Michael Cohen."
"Plans for a compulsory land purchase and the permanent closure of a road to allow the £81m upgrade to proceed are due to go before the States this month. Deputy Tony Spruce, who sits on the Airport Project Group, said the parcel of land was vital to the project. The two biggest airlines using the airport said work ""had to be done"". The managers of Aurigny and Flybe both urged politicians to stop talking and get on with the work. 'Work is critical' The upgrade project had originally been scheduled to start early in 2011. Deputy Spruce said: ""Basically we need that parcel of land to do anything at the airport."" Le Messurier family, who own the property, have previously said they were resigned to losing the land that has been in their possession for decades. The States has also been asked to agree to the permanent closure of La Mare Road, which would become part of the extended safety area.

"Ian Matthew Vaudin, 36, and Mark Brian Le Gallez, 28, were sentenced at the Guernsey Royal Court on Monday. They pleaded guilty to the importation. Both men were sentenced to two years and three months in prison. The total quantity of diazepam would have had a potential local resale value of between £1,003 and £3,009. On 7 August 2013 a drug detector dog took an interest in a recorded delivery postal packet, which was found to contain a freezer bag with 1,003 diazepam tablets inside. The packet was addressed to Vaudin, who was arrested when he arrived to collect it from the Post Office later that day.

"The Pew Research Center found overall support for police is steady, but fewer people say officers use appropriate force. Despite a recent clamour to reduce spending on law enforcement, 73% say it should stay the same or even increase. The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May has spurred a debate over police reform. The analysis, released on Thursday, shows modest declines in police support over the past four years. A solid majority, 58%, still say police do a good or excellent job of protecting people from crime, down just 4% since 2016. Declines are more pronounced, however, in other categories: using the right amount of force, treating racial and ethnic groups equally, and holding officers accountable for misconduct. In each of these areas, approval dropped by at least 10%, with just about one third of the American public giving police forces positive ratings. And the gaps in police approval were even wider along partisan and racial lines. Two-thirds of white adults, for example, said the police were doing a good or excellent job at protecting the public, while half of Hispanic adults and just 28% of black adults agreed. In every aspect of policing, Democrats are less likely than Republicans to view police favourably. For example, while 89% of Republicans see police as treating racial groups equally, just 10% of Democrats say the same. An overwhelming majority of Americans - 92% - say police should be trained in nonviolent alternatives to deadly force, in line with ongoing protests against the use of deadly force by police, especially against African Americans. The survey found that 66% of respondents said civilians should be able to sue police officers for misconduct or excessive force. Police officers are shielded from lawsuits under the doctrine of ""qualified immunity"". Police unions argue that officers will not be able to carry out their duties effectively if the threat of a lawsuit hangs over every public interaction. But critics say qualified immunity enables egregious police misconduct. Last month, US House of Representatives Democrats passed sweeping legislation on police reform that called for an end to qualified immunity. Republicans rejected this and other proposals in the package, leaving the legislation in limbo. More on the US protests","A two-thirds majority of Americans say they support giving civilians the power to sue police, a new survey suggests."
"Prentis Robinson, 55, had just left a police station where he had reported one of his phones as stolen, and was filming himself with a selfie stick. A man is then seen in the short video exchanging words with the victim. ""You're on live,"" Mr Robinson tells him before four gunshots are fired. A man, named by police as Douglas Colson, has been arrested. The gunman, who police say was armed with a long-barrelled gun, is seen quickly walking over the camera as he flees the scene. The Wingate Police Department said Mr Colson was questioned on Monday but was not arrested at the time. On Tuesday morning he turned himself in to police after they issued a warrant for his arrest. The shooting, which occurred at about 10:00 local time (15:00GMT) on Monday, triggered a lockdown of nearby Wingate University, about 30 miles (48km) south-east of Charlotte, North Carolina. Police say Mr Robinson would often go on Facebook Live to expose problems in the neighbourhood.

"Neil Heywood Bo Xilai Gu Kailai Bo Guagua Wang Lijun Patrick Devillers Jiang Feng Dolby Dalian Chongqing French villa Bo Xilai Former Communist Party chief of Chongqing and Politburo member Mr Bo, the son of a famous Communist Party hero, was once a political high-flyer and described as the nearest China had to a Western-style politician. He ran the coastal city of Dalian and was commerce minister before becoming Party chief of south-western metropolis of Chongqing. He was removed from office following Neil Heywood’s death and was charged with bribery, corruption and abuse of power. Gu Kailai Lawyer and wife of Bo Xilai Ms Gu, whose father was a prominent revolutionary general, is a well-known lawyer and second wife of Bo Xilai. She studied at Peking University before opening the Kailai law firm in Beijing. Fluent in English, she and her husband were once one of China's most powerful couples. Last year, she was convicted of Mr Heywood's murder, reportedly over a deal gone wrong, and given a suspended death sentence. Bo Guagua Son of Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai Educated at the exclusive British private school Harrow, followed by Oxford and Harvard Universities, Bo Guagua has been described as one of China's ""princelings"" - the descendants of revolutionary leaders often criticised for their lavish lifestyles. Since his parents’ fall, Bo Guagua has remained in the US, where he is preparing to study law at Colombia University in New York. In a statement issued ahead of Mr Bo’s trial, Bo Guagua said he hoped his father would be allowed to defend himself ""without constraints"". Wang Lijun Former Chongqing police chief Mr Wang, once a popular police chief and Bo Xilai’s deputy in Chongqing, began his career in law enforcement in the Inner Mongolia region before moving to Chongqing in 2008. He worked closely with Mr Bo but, after an apparent falling out, Mr Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, near Chongqing, where he raised concerns about the circumstances of Neil Heywood’s death. Mr Wang has since been jailed for 15 years, charged with defection, power abuse and bribe-taking. Patrick Devillers French architect Mr Devillers is believed to have met Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai in the 1990s while living in Dalian and reportedly helped design street grids in the port city while Mr Bo was mayor. French documents quoted by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times said he also oversaw the running of a villa in the South of France - allegedly belonging to Mr Bo - between 2001 to 2007. He was detained in Cambodia, where he lives, before voluntarily flying to China in July 2012. Reports say Chinese authorities wanted to talk to him as a witness in the Neil Heywood case. Jiang Feng Dolby Television presenter and business woman Mrs Dolby, born in China but now a British citizen through marriage, is well known in China as a state TV presenter. However, after moving to Britain she ran an educational consulting company, which it is claimed helped get the children of wealthy Chinese couples into leading British and American schools and universities. Mrs Dolby was named in official documents quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the manager of a villa in the south of France that is expected to be one of the key pieces of evidence at Mr Bo's trial. Dalian Major seaport in north-eastern China It was here that Bo Xilai's political career was set on the fast track when he was appointed mayor. Mr Bo was credited with developing Dalian from an unremarkable port city to a showcase for China's economic boom. It was also in Dalian that Mr Bo and Gu Kailai reportedly first met Mr Heywood and Mr Devillers. Chongqing Major city in south-western China Bo Xilai was appointed Communist Party chief of Chongqing in 2007. Wang Lijun, the city’s former police chief, was his deputy. Mr Bo became well-known for a high-profile crackdown on crime and advancing the ""Chongqing model"" of development, which spent heavily on developing public housing and infrastructure. However, his ambition and flamboyant style earned him enemies and raised eyebrows among party leaders back in Beijing. It was in a hotel room in Chongqing that British businessman Neil Heywood was found dead in November 2011. French villa Cannes, France A six-bedroom villa in the south of France is expected to play a role in the trial of Bo Xilai. The $3.5m (£2.2m) property in Cannes was allegedly given to Mr Bo as a bribe. It it claimed to have been bought by Xu Ming, a billionaire backer of Mr Bo in Dalian. French documents quoted by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times state people close to the Bo family have been involved with the villa since 2001. French architect Patrick Devillers, British businessman Neil Heywood and Feng Jiang Dolby, a former presenter on China's state TV, have all overseen the running of the property, the papers said. Neil Heywood British businessman Having enjoyed a privileged education at Harrow school, Mr Heywood moved to China in the early 1990s where he learned Mandarin, married his Chinese wife Wang Lulu and started a business career. The father-of-two worked as a consultant to foreign businesses seeking investment in China. It was while living in the north-eastern port city of Dalian in the mid-1990s that Mr Heywood met Bo Xilai - then the city’s mayor - and his wife Gu Kailai. More than a decade later, Mr Heywood was found dead in a hotel room in the south-western city Chongqing - where Mr Bo had since become Communist Party chief. In 2012, Gu Kailai and an aide were convicted of poisoning him because of ""economic conflict"". The case led to the dismissal of Chongqing party boss and former high-flier Bo Xilai, who was tried in August 2013 for bribery, corruption and abuse of power. His wife, Gu Kailai, has been convicted of killing Mr Heywood. The BBC profiles the key players. Neil Heywood The death of 41-year-old British businessman Neil Heywood is at the heart of the scandal. Born in 1970, Mr Heywood was educated at Harrow School and Warwick University. He lived in China from the early 1990s, where he learned fluent Mandarin. He was a consultant to foreign businesses seeking investment in China, setting up several companies and advising clients. Mr Heywood married a Chinese woman, Wang Lulu, and the couple had two children. It was while living in the north-eastern port city of Dalian in the mid-1990s that he met the mayor, Bo Xilai, and his wife Gu Kailai. By 2007, Mr Bo had been appointed Communist Party chief of Chongqing. The nature of Mr Heywood's association with Mr Bo and Ms Gu is not clear, but he has been described in some reports as a financial middleman. Mr Heywood was found dead on 15 November 2011 at a hotel in Chongqing. Chongqing's Public Security Bureau told British consular officials the cause of death was ""overconsumption of alcohol"" and his body was then cremated, a decision taken by his family. But the case was then reopened. Gu Kailai and her aide were convicted in August 2012 of poisoning him to death because of ""economic conflict"". Gu Kailai The second wife of Bo Xilai, Gu Kailai was a well-known lawyer whose father was a prominent revolutionary. Gu Kailai studied at Peking University and then opened the Kailai law firm in Beijing. Fluent in English, she wrote a book about her legal battles called Winning a Lawsuit in the US. She and her husband were once one of China's most powerful couples - until an announcement in April 2012 that she was being investigated for the murder of Neil Heywood. Gu Kailai was put on trial on 9 August 2012 for the murder - a crime she committed, according to state media, because of a conflict over economic interests. A court official said she did not contest the charges, with state media saying she blamed her actions on a ""mental breakdown"". She reportedly said she would ""accept and calmly face any sentence"" for poisoning the British businessman with cyanide. On 20 August 2012, she was convicted of Mr Heywood's murder and given a suspended death sentence. Bo Xilai Bo Xilai was once a top politician tipped for the highest office. Son of a famous communist hero, he ran the coastal city of Dalian and then became commerce minister before being named Communist Party chief of Chongqing. He was known for launching two high-profile campaigns in Chongqing - one to promote China's communist past and the other to crack down on organised crime. At home in front of the cameras, he was seen as both populist and charismatic. Many believed he was in the running for promotion in China's 10-yearly leadership transition in 2012. But Mr Bo was removed as Chongqing party chief on 15 March of that year and suspended from the Communist Party's hugely powerful 25-member politburo and Central Committee. On 25 July 2013, state media reported that Mr Bo had been charged with bribery, corruption and abuse of power. His trial took place from 22 to 26 August. Mr Bo vigorously denied the charges levelled against him. He was found guilty on all charges on 22 September and sentenced to life in prison. Bo Guagua Bo Guagua, 25, is the son of Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai. He studied at one of Britain's most expensive private schools, Harrow, before going on to Oxford University and then Harvard. Bo Guagua has been described as one of China's younger ""princelings"" - the descendants of revolutionary leaders who are often criticised for the privileges they enjoy. Photographs that appear to show him enjoying himself at parties have whizzed around internet sites, as has criticism of his perceived decadent lifestyle. Chinese state media have also linked him to Neil Heywood, saying both he and his mother ""were on good terms with Heywood. However, they had conflict over economic interests"". Bo Guagua was in the US studying at Harvard when scandal engulfed his family. He has since remained there and is believed to have started a law degree at Columbia University in New York. He has issued statements defending his parents, most recently on 20 August 2013. ""It has been 18 months since I have been denied contact with either my father or my mother. I can only surmise the conditions of their clandestine detention and the adversity they each endure in solitude,"" he said in a statement to the New York Times. ""I hope that in my father's upcoming trial, he is granted the opportunity to answer his critics and defend himself without constraints of any kind."" Wang Lijun Wang Lijun was a popular police chief and vice-mayor in Chongqing whose flight to the US consulate in Chengdu in February 2012 brought Neil Heywood's murder out into the open. Mr Wang started his career in law enforcement in 1984 in the Inner Mongolia region before moving to Chongqing in 2008. He developed a reputation for being tough on organised crime and was even the subject of a TV drama, Iron-Blooded Police Spirits. On 2 February 2012, the Chongqing city government said Wang had been shifted to another job - the first public confirmation of his falling out with Mr Bo. He fled to the US consulate in Chengdu, near Chongqing, on 6 February that year. He spent the night at the consulate but was persuaded to leave a day later. Many believe he went there to seek asylum. According to a statement from the UK Foreign Office on 17 April 2012, Wang made allegations about Mr Heywood's death while at the consulate. Announcing his dismissal from the party in April of that year, Li Yuanchao, the head of the organisation department, called Wang Lijun's visit to the US consulate a ""serious incident with very bad consequences"". On 5 September 2012, Wang was charged with defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. After a two-day trial, he was jailed on 24 September for 15 years. State media said he had ""bent the law"" by appointing an ally to oversee the investigation into Neil Heywood's death because he knew Gu Kailai was a key suspect - and that he had hidden a recording of her admitting the crime. Zhang Xiaojun Zhang Xiaojun was charged alongside Gu Kailai with intentional homicide. Zhang was said to be ""an orderly at Bo's home"" according to a Xinhua report on 18 April 2012. When Xinhua announced the charges on 26 July 2012, the news agency said he poisoned Neil Heywood to death, along with Gu Kailai. He admitted his involvement in the murder during the trial, a court official said, and said he wanted to apologise to Mr Heywood's relatives. Patrick Devillers French architect Patrick Henri Devillers, who was living in Cambodia until 2012, was reported to have links to Mr Bo and Ms Gu. The 52-year-old is believed to have met the couple in the 1990s, while he was living in Dalian with his then wife. Reports said he helped to lay out street grids in the city while Mr Bo was mayor. In June 2012, he was detained in Cambodia at China's request. He then voluntarily flew to China on 17 July 2012, reportedly as a witness in the Heywood case. Before leaving for China Mr Devillers made a video which appeared to be an interview with Cambodian officials, saying that he was doing so voluntarily. Media reports have linked him to a villa in France that reports suggest could be at the heart of charges against Bo Xilai. Xu Ming In 2005 Forbes magazine named Xu Ming China's eighth richest man. Mr Xu amassed his fortune in the city of Dalian, where Bo Xilai was mayor from 1993-2001, through his company Dalian Shide, a conglomerate with wide-ranging interests. But Xu Ming went missing in March 2012, around the same time Mr Bo fell from grace. The Wall Street Journal, citing an unidentified company official, said Mr Xu had called his brother in May to say he was under investigation. Mr Xu testified in court during Mr Bo's trial. Prosecutors said Mr Bo had accepted bribes from Mr Xu and another businessman, Tang Xiaolin. According to court transcripts, Mr Xu said he gave Gu Kailai money to buy a villa in France, and paid for some of Bo Guagua's expenses including a trip to Africa and a credit card bill. Feng Jiang Dolby Feng Jiang Dolby is a former TV host who has been named in French court documents as the manager of the villa - a role she took over from Neil Heywood and before him Patrick Devillers, the Telegraph reported. Ms Dolby, who used to work as a presenter for China's state broadcaster CCTV, is based in the UK and married to a British national. Zhou Yongkang Zhou Yongkang, 70, was a member of the politburo's nine-member Standing Committee, the most powerful committee in China, until the leadership handover in November 2012. He was also secretary of the Committee of Political and Legislative Affairs, which gave him control over police and security forces. Before becoming head of the Public Security Ministry in 2003, he was the party head in Sichuan province. While there, he gained a reputation for dealing firmly with dissent - coming down hard on Tibetan groups and the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong. He is considered to have been Bo Xilai's mentor and to be close to former President Jiang Zemin, who is still powerful. In 2012, unverified rumours circulating on Chinese websites said Mr Zhou was under investigation and could be the next to go. But a report in the Communist Party's mouthpiece, the People's Daily, then made a splash of Mr Zhou visiting the western Xinjiang region. He represented the region at the Communist Party Congress in November 2012 in Beijing, before retiring from the Standing Committee and the Public Security Ministry later that month. China announced a corruption investigation against another one of his mentees, Jiang Jiemin, on 1 September. This prompted speculation amongst some that Mr Zhou was in trouble. Wen Jiabao Wen Jiabao was China's premier until March 2013, when his successor Li Keqiang took the reins. Bo Xilai's dismissal had been interpreted by some as part of a political struggle between supporters of former President Jiang Zemin and supporters of Mr Wen and former President Hu Jintao, who were considered to be more open to reform. Mr Wen indirectly criticised Bo Xilai at his last National People's Congress news conference in April 2012. Although he did not name Mr Bo directly, he said that local authorities must ""seriously"" reflect and learn from the Wang Lijun incident. He also touched on China's Cultural Revolution, a chaotic 10-year period when normal life was turned on its head. He warned that China could experience a similar period of instability without political reforms, and that ""the mistakes of the Cultural Revolution… have yet to be fully eliminated"". This was seen as criticism of Bo Xilai's approach in Chongqing. Mr Bo had enjoyed reminding people of the days of the Cultural Revolution by sending volunteers into the countryside and giving rousing speeches about China's communist past - moves that gained him many left-wing supporters.",The death of British businessman Neil Heywood in the Chinese city of Chongqing in November 2011 sparked the biggest shake-up to hit the Communist Party in decades and exposed high-level political divisions.
"Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter That's the aim of a unique clinical trial in Sweden that aims to intervene in the lives of potential abusers. And it's a trial that raises ethical and legal questions about whether societies can come up with therapies for the most dangerous offenders before they have broken the law. The trial at the Karolinska Institute, one of the world's leading medical universities, will recruit up to 60 potential sex offenders before they have broken the law. The team, led by Dr Christoffer Rahm, will then investigate whether they can use a medicine to reduce the risk of the individual committing child abuse. ""Up until now most of the attention has been on how to deal with perpetrators [once detected] by the police or by the authorities, but by this stage children have already been harmed,"" says Dr Rahm. ""I want to shift focus and explore methods of preventing child sex abuse from happening in the first place."" Drug treatments for sex offenders, popularly known as chemical castration, aren't new. There are a string of countries where men can have medication imposed upon them to crush their sex drive. But nobody knows whether such treatments can be used to prevent abuse in the first place. And that's where Dr Rahm's programme, which is seeking crowdfunding support, seeks to come in. Over the course of two years, the 60 volunteers will be split into two groups. One will receive a drug that is known to rapidly and dramatically reduce levels of testosterone. The other will receive a placebo. Neither the researcher team nor the volunteers will know who is getting the medicine. This convoluted approach is the gold standard for clinical trials because nobody knows who is taking what until the end, meaning no-one can game the results and conclusions can't be prejudiced by assumptions. So, in theory, the researchers could come closer to establishing which types of offenders genuinely benefit in the long-term from having chemical castration-style drugs as part of therapy. So how exactly are they recruiting these volunteers and how will they measure success? Here in the UK, seven prisons give anti-libidinal drugs to paedophiles as part of a wider package designed to address offending. But forensic psychiatrist Professor Donald Grubin of the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, a government consultant, says anyone on the cusp of offending is in a different situation altogether. ""The problem has been getting psychiatrists on board to treat [potential offenders],"" he says. ""If you go to a GP, they will struggle to find someone to refer you on to."" One British organisation that offers therapeutic help to ""non-offending"" paedophiles has recently received the backing of Paul Jones whose five-year-old daughter April was murdered by a man who had previously downloaded abuse images. In Sweden, things are different. The Karolinksa Institute operates a national helpline for potential offenders called Preventell. It will introduce volunteers to the clinical trial. Once inside the trial, the treatment group will receive a drug called Degarelix which, says Dr Rahm, leaves 97% of men who receive it with no detectable testosterone within three days. And that raises two important ethical questions - why shouldn't all the volunteers receive the drug and, even more importantly, what happens if the trial comes across evidence that some men fail to respond and children are being exposed to risks? Anti-libidinal drugs for paedophiles: The British prison scheme For those of us in the non-scientific world, it may seem odd to deny someone a drug that could help. But the ethical argument goes that the participants on placebos are in no worse position than before they agreed to take part - they have not committed an offence and, therefore, would not be able to receive treatment in the first place. As for the risk of offending, the research team will look for signs of changes in the minds of their subjects. They will test for lower sexual arousal, less impulsiveness (such as testosterone-fuelled lack of self-control) and they will also measure empathy towards potential victims. Each volunteer will undergo brain scans that will document their reactions to computer-generated pictures resembling adults and children in swimming costumes or underwear. Finally, Dr Rahm says the research includes carefully-constructed questions to uncover whether any of the men are at risk of abusing children at the outset of and during the trial. Whatever the results of this Swedish trial, Professor Grubin says society needs to grasp bigger legal and ethical questions over how to offer prevention without scaring off those who need the help. ""The problem is confidentiality,"" he says. ""If someone says they want help [by downloading abuse images] and the doctor has to report them to the police, then they are not going to come forward.""",Can you stop a paedophile before they've abused a child?
"Lee Sook-hee filed the suit against Mr Lee, 70, over shares their late father left, her lawyer told AFP on Tuesday. She is demanding the return of assets worth about 190bn won ($169m, £107m), said Yonhap news agency. The suit is along the same lines as one filed two weeks ago by Mr Lee's brother, Lee Maeng-hee, 80, Ms Lee's lawyer said. The elder Mr Lee's suit is for 700bn won ($623m; £396m) in shares in the group's flagship, Samsung Electronics, and Samsung Life Insurance, as well as in cash. According to court documents filed by Lee Maeng-hee, ""the stocks... were assets put in a trust under the name of non-heirs, and they should have been apportioned to the heirs according to law"". Lee Kun-hee is accused of keeping the shares for himself. This is a tale to compete with the most gripping of Korean television dramas, says the BBC's correspondent in Seoul, Lucy Williamson, with allegations of secret shares inside South Korea's most successful electronics company. ""We understand that the matter of inheritance has long since been settled,"" a Samsung group spokesman told AFP without further details. Presidential pardon The siblings' father Lee Byung-chull, who died in 1987, founded Samsung selling dried fish in South Korea in 1938. The Samsung Group now includes shipbuilding, telecoms, electronics and construction among its companies, and had a turnover of $220bn in 2010. Last month, Samsung Electronics reported a 17% rise in profits for the last three months of 2011. Lee Kun-hee took over the chairmanship of Samsung in 1987. However, in April 2008, he resigned in disgrace after being charged with tax evasion and breach of trust. He was convicted on the tax charges, but was given a presidential pardon in 2009 and returned to lead Samsung in 2010. According to the 2010 Forbes Rich List, he was the richest man in South Korea with a personal fortune of $7.9bn.","The chairman of South Korean electronics giant Samsung, Lee Kun-hee, is being sued by his sister."

"Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein told the BBC the Nobel Peace prize winner should have considered returning to house arrest rather than excusing the military. A new UN report says Myanmar's military should be investigated for genocide. Myanmar has rejected the report as one-sided. The army of the Buddhist-majority nation - which has been accused of systematic ethnic cleansing - has previously cleared itself of wrongdoing. The UN report, published on Monday, blamed Ms Suu Kyi, a long-term leader of the pro-democracy movement, for failing to prevent the violence. ""She was in a position to do something,"" Mr Hussein said in an interview with the BBC's Imogen Foulkes. ""She could have stayed quiet - or even better, she could have resigned."" ""There was no need for her to be the spokesperson of the Burmese military. She didn't have to say this was an iceberg of misinformation. These were fabrications,"" he said. ""She could have said look, you know, I am prepared to be the nominal leader of the country but not under these conditions. ""Thank you very much, I will resign, I will go back into house arrest - I cannot be an adjunct accessory that others may think I am when it comes to these violations."" Between 1989 and 2010, Ms Suu Kyi, 73, spent about 16 years under house arrest by the military government. On Wednesday, the Nobel committee said Ms Suu Kyi could not be stripped of the Peace Prize she was awarded in 1991. What has Aung Sun Suu Kyi said? While it is acknowledged that Ms Suu Kyi does not control the military, she has faced international pressure to condemn the army's alleged brutality. For decades, she was hailed as the heroine of the human rights community - most notably for enduring house arrest for her pro-democracy activism during a brutal military dictatorship. When communal violence broke out in 2012 and displaced more than 100,000 Rohingya people, Ms Suu Kyi sought to reassure the international community and pledged to ""abide by our commitment to human rights and democratic values"". ""Muslims have been targeted but Buddhists have also been subjected to violence,"" she told the BBC at the time. ""This fear is what is leading all the trouble."" She said that it was down to the government to bring an end to the violence, explaining: ""This is the result of our suffering under a dictatorial regime."" In 2015, her National League for Democracy party won a landslide election victory and she became Myanmar's de-facto leader. As the Rohingya crisis continued, Ms Suu Kyi's comments on the situation tended to play it down or suggest that people were exaggerating the severity of the violence. The last time she spoke to the BBC in April 2017, she said: ""I don't think there is ethnic cleansing going on. I think ethnic cleansing is too strong an expression to use for what is happening."" Since an outbreak of violence started in August 2017, Ms Suu Kyi has missed several opportunities to speak publicly about the issue, including the UN General Assembly in New York last September. She later claimed the crisis was being distorted by a ""huge iceberg of misinformation"" - but then also said she felt ""deeply"" for the suffering of ""all people"" in the conflict. Myanmar, she said, was ""committed to a sustainable solution... for all communities in this state."" Harsh words and bitter criticism Imogen Foulkes, BBC Geneva correspondent Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein is known for his bluntness and his comments on Aung San Suu Kyi were no exception. He bitterly criticised her attempts to excuse Myanmar's military. This week, UN investigators published evidence linking senior commanders to act of genocide. His harsh words are another indication that Aung San Suu Kyi may now go down in history not as a Nobel Peace prize winner and pro-democracy leader, but as a woman who failed to act in the face of unspeakable human rights violations. What is the Rohingya crisis? The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship and considered illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh despite calling the Rakhine state home for generations. The military launched a crackdown in Rakhine last year after Rohingya militants carried out deadly attacks on police posts. Thousands of people have died and more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since August 2017. There have also been widespread allegations of human rights abuses against the Rohingya, including arbitrary killing, rape and burning of land over many years.",The outgoing UN human rights chief says Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi should have resigned over the military's violent campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority last year.

"He said his recent visit to Saudi Arabia was ""already paying off"" and the development might mark the ""beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE, Yemen, Libya's eastern-based government and the Maldives have all cut diplomatic and other ties with Qatar. Qatar strongly denies the allegations. Mr Trump's recent speech in the capital Riyadh, in which he blamed Iran for instability in the Middle East and urged Muslim countries to take the lead in combating radicalisation, is seen as likely to have emboldened Gulf allies to act against Qatar. ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!"" Mr Trump tweeted on Tuesday. He later tweeted: ""So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding... extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!"" Qatar is home to the biggest US military air base in the Middle East, with about 8,000 personnel based at al-Udeid. The official statement from White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US was in communication with all parties ""to resolve issues and restore co-operation"". ""The US still wants to see this issue de-escalated and resolved immediately, in keeping with the principles that the president laid out in terms of defeating terror financing and extremism,"" he said. In the same week as Mr Trump's Riyadh speech, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE blocked Qatari news sites, including Al Jazeera. On Monday, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the UAE gave Qatari nationals two weeks to leave, banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar, and cut all transport links. Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Tuesday that the economic measures should persuade Qatar to change its policies and behave ""like a normal country"". Speaking in Paris, he called on Qatar's rulers to end their support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the Palestinian militant group Hamas and what he called ""hostile media"". ""We believe that common sense and logic and will convince Qatar to take the right steps,"" he said. The emir of Kuwait - one of the Gulf countries not involved in the dispute - travelled to Saudi Arabia on Tuesday in an attempt to mediate. He later left after a ""brotherly visit"" but there was no word on the outcome of the talks. Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told Al Jazeera that his country would not retaliate but was unhappy with regional rivals ""trying to impose their will on Qatar or intervene in its internal affairs"". He told the BBC that Qatar was well prepared to withstand a ""blockade"", but also complained that the people of Qatar were the victims of ""collective punishment"" by other countries. The foreign minister said his government had told President Trump during his Middle-East trip that there was no evidence that Qatar was supporting radical Islamists, adding that the claims were based on ""fabricated evidence and lies"". 'Murkier dealings' - Analysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC Washington correspondent To be clear, when it comes to terrorist financing, nobody's hands are clean. The Qataris, Saudis and Kuwaitis have all funded extremists in the Syria conflict. All have pulled back from that under US pressure. But Qatar's dealings are arguably murkier than the others because it likes to see itself as a neutral player that can act as an intermediary, and is thus willing to play both sides - Saudi Arabia and Iran. Whatever the case, the Pentagon doesn't share Mr Trump's tone of triumphalism. Qatar hosts America's biggest Middle East air base, the nerve centre for the air campaigns in Syria and Iraq against the Islamic State group. So far officials say operations have not been affected, but they might be if diplomatic feuding continues amongst US Arab allies. What steps have been taken against Qatar? The states that joined Monday's move against Qatar, a tiny but gas-rich peninsula, include some of the biggest powers in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE closed all transport links. Disruption to airspace in the Gulf began on Tuesday morning local time. Doha, Qatar's capital, is a major hub for international flight connections. Airlines affected include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have revoked the licences of Qatar Airways and ordered its offices to close within 48 hours. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatar's planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times. In a country reliant on imported food, residents have started to stockpile. How the economy may be hit: Andrew Walker, BBC News A substantial amount of Qatar's food is transported across the border from Saudi Arabia, which is being closed. That is also an important route for construction materials - needed for the energy industry and for the preparations for the 2022 football World Cup. Qatar's exports are dominated by oil and gas. They are mostly seaborne, so should not be immediately hit, but the general economic disruption could have an impact if the dispute drags on. That possibility pushed the price of crude oil higher, but only briefly. Qatar is a member of the exporters' group Opec and the dispute could yet undermine the organisation's efforts to raise prices by restricting production. Why did this come about? While the severing of ties was sudden, tensions have been building for years and particularly in recent weeks. Broadly, two key factors drove Monday's decision: Qatar's ties to Islamist groups, and to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. Wealthy individuals in Qatar are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria - Qatar says this is not the case. The Financial Times also reports that Gulf allies were angry that Qatar had paid a $1bn (£773m) ransom to jihadists and Iranian security officials after Qatari nationals were kidnapped in Iraq and Syria. Is Saudi to blame for IS? Saudi Arabia, too, has been accused of funding IS, either directly or by failing to prevent private donors from sending money to the group - allegations it denies.

"Congo-Brazzaville's president has also promised to import the drink. It is produced from the artemisia plant - the source of an ingredient used in a malaria treatment. The WHO also advised people against self-medicating. The drink was launched as Covid-Organics and was being marketed after being tested on fewer than 20 people over a period of three weeks, the Malagasy president's chief of staff Lova Hasinirina Ranoromaro told the BBC last month. In response to the launch of Covid-Organics, the WHO said in a statement sent to the BBC that the global organisation did not recommend ""self-medication with any medicines... as a prevention or cure for Covid-19"". It reiterated earlier comments by WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that there were ""no short-cuts"" to finding effective mediation to fight coronarvirus. International trials were under way to find an effective treatment, the WHO added. In March, the US-based National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health warned against purported coronavirus remedies, including herbal therapies and teas - saying the best way to prevent infection was to avoid exposure to the virus. The drink has been picked up in other African countries. On Saturday Madagascar delivered a shipment to Guinea-Bissau. The Malagasy president also tweeted that the special envoy to Equatorial Guinea picked up a shipment of the drink. Speaking on TV, President Magufuli said he was already in contact with the government of Madagascar and would despatch an aircraft to the island nation to collect the medicine. ""I am communicating with Madagascar, and they have already written a letter saying they have discovered some medicine. We will despatch a flight to bring the medicine so that Tanzanians can also benefit. So as the government we are working day and night,"" he said. Mr Magufuli has already been widely criticised for his reaction to the coronavirus pandemic. He has encouraged the public to continue gathering in places of worship, while much of the world has faced lockdown. Tanzania's delay in enforcing stricter measures to prevent further spread of coronavirus in the country could have led to the spike in positive cases, according to the WHO. The country has 480 confirmed cases of coronavirus but Mr Magufuli said that number may be exaggerated and that he doubted the credibility of the national laboratory. He said that he had secretly had some animals and fruits tested at the laboratory and that a papaya (paw-paw), a quail and a goat returned positive samples. ""That means there is possibility for technical errors or these imported reagents have issues,"" he said, without giving more detail.

"Vinícius LemosBBC News Brasil It was their first house, and it made them proud. The couple lived in Machadinho D'Oeste, a rural village in the Amazon state of Rondonia in north-west Brazil. It is a region marred by land disputes, and among communities in Machadinho D'Oeste, it is common practice to clear land for pastures and crops. Fires had been a constant concern for the couple, who feared that those started by their neighbours could spread to their backyard, especially during periods of drought. On 13 August, Eidi and Romildo's worst fears were realised. The couple died while trying to protect their home, unable to escape when the flames got out of control. ""People use fire to clear the land in this region, but on that day it was very windy. The fire spread too quickly and didn't give them time to run away,"" Jeigislaine Carvalho, one of Eidi's daughters, told the BBC. What is happening in the Amazon? A large number of fires are ravaging parts of the Amazon, a tropical rainforest that spans much of Brazil and other South American countries. Satellite data shows a huge increase in fires burning in the Brazilian Amazon in particular. Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) says 87,257 fires have been recorded so far in the country this year, a 76% increase on 2018. In Rondonia state alone, there have been more than 6,500 fires so far, a rise of 146% on 2018, Inpe data show. The extent of the fires has caused concern and outrage across the globe, with world leaders calling on Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro to take action. French President Emmanuel Macron has described the steep rise in fires as an ""international crisis"" which critics have blamed on Mr Bolsonaro's anti-environmental rhetoric and soft stance on deforestation violations. An aid package worth $22m (£18m), offered by countries in the G7, has been rejected by Brazil's government. Brazilian ministers said the money was not needed and they accused foreign powers of wanting control of the Amazon. Eidi and Romildo saved their earnings for more than 10 years to purchase the land where they built their house. Neighbours told the police the couple had avoided leaving their property, even during intense fires. Like many other farmers in the region, they used firebreaks - gaps in vegetation which act as barriers to stop or at least to slow down the progress of wildfires. ""People do whatever they can to avoid losing the very little they own,"" detective Celso Kondageski said. The rural village where Eidi and Romildo lived is located 350km (217 miles) south of Rondonia's capital, Porto Velho. It is a deforested part of the state, which means fires travel faster. On 13 August, locals shared videos showing huge flames engulfing the area. Jeigislaine, Eidi's daughter, said her mother and stepfather had tried to save the roof tiles they had recently purchased for home renovations. ""The neighbours told me that they were taking the material to a more remote area so that it would not burn,"" she said. Fire was approaching the back of the property, which gave Eidi and Romildo an escape route from the front of the house, witnesses told the police. But suddenly they were cornered by another fire coming from the front. According to local reports, the fires in Machadinho D'Oeste consumed an area spanning more than 106 acres (0.42 sq km). Eidi and Ronildo's house was destroyed along with two other properties. One witness told the BBC that, fearful of receiving a fine for deforestation, people were reluctant to summon the fire brigade when the flames started getting out of control. ""The fire only stopped after it destroyed all the vegetation around. It was very strong and I guess even the firefighters would have struggled to control it,"" said the witness, who asked to remain anonymous. It was only on 14 August - a day after the flames ripped through Eidi and Ronildo's house - that the fire service turned up. They found the charred bodies of Eidi and Romildo around 100m (328ft) away from where their house once stood. The police believe they died of carbon monoxide inhalation. Eidi and Romildo were the only fatalities. The other neighbours managed to escape, and one of the homes wrecked by the flames was empty that day. Police are trying to determine how the fire started. ""The fire is an environmental crime. People responsible for it could also be charged with manslaughter,"" detective Celso Kondagesk said. ""Someone who starts a fire in an area like that should be aware that it can kill someone."" Eidi's daughter says she wants justice. ""This is irresponsible and it killed two people. Whoever did this has to pay,"" she said.",The home of Eidi Rodrigues and her husband Romildo - a wooden shack with a thatched roof - now lies in ruins.
"The former civil servant, known only as Anchan, posted audio clips from a podcast on social media. The 63-year-old said she had simply shared the audio files and had not commented on the content. Thailand's lèse-majesté law, which forbids any insult to the monarchy, is among the strictest in the world. After a three-year break, Thailand revived the controversial law late last year in an attempt to curb months of anti-government protests, with demonstrators demanding changes to the monarchy. Anchan pleaded guilty to 29 separate violations of sharing and posting clips on YouTube and Facebook between 2014 and 2015, her lawyer told the Reuters news agency. She was initially sentenced to 87 years, but this was cut in half because of her guilty plea. Anchan is among a group of 14 people charged with lèse-majesté shortly after a military junta seized power in 2014, vowing to stamp out criticism of the monarchy. The group is accused of uploading podcasts, popular in dissident circles, which questioned official accounts of the monarchy. The author of the podcasts served only two years in jail, and has already been released. The trial was held behind closed doors and the evidence against the defendant kept secret for reasons of national security. That someone accused only of uploading these clips to social media should be given such a harsh sentence, so long after the original arrests, suggests the authorities want to send a warning to other dissidents to stop talking about the monarchy. During a wave of student-led protests last year there was open questioning of the wealth, the political role and personal life of King Vajiralongkorn on a scale never seen in Thailand before. More than 40 mainly young activists have been charged with lèse-majesté over the past few weeks, some multiple times. Until the end of last year the law, which has been condemned by UN human rights officials as excessively severe, had been suspended for a three-year period, at the king's request. That leniency has clearly come to an end. Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February after a court ordered a fledgling pro-democracy opposition party to dissolve. While protesters had a range of demands relating to the government, things really kicked off when protesters began questioning the powers of the monarchy. Protests included demands to curb recently expanded powers to the monarchy and challenged the king's decision to declare Crown wealth as his personal property, making him by far the wealthiest person in Thailand. It had until now been notionally held in trust for the benefit of the people. There have also been questions over King Vajiralongkorn's decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand. The move sent shockwaves through a country where people are taught from birth to revere and love the monarchy and fear the consequences of talking about it. The definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy in Thailand is unclear and human rights groups say the lèse-majesté law has often been used as a political tool to curb free speech and resist opposition calls for reform and change. Royalists have come out to oppose the student-led demonstrations - and say the protesters want the abolition of the monarchy, something they deny.","A Thai woman has been jailed for 43 years for criticising the royal family, the country's harshest ever sentence for insulting the monarchy."
"The divide comes as a blow to the president's 2014 executive action which he enacted without Congress and will now be assessed in a lower court. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan applauded the news, saying only Congress should write laws. But the president said the deadlock was ""heartbreaking"" for millions of people. ""They are Americans in every way but on paper,"" he said at the White House, adding that reform will happen, sooner or later. ""Congress is not going to be able to ignore America forever,"" he said. Texas led 26 Republican-led states in challenging the programme, which would have given the right to work to millions of people. The deadlock between the eight judges was only possible because of the death of the ninth, Justice Antonin Scalia, leaving a vacancy that is still unfilled. This is the first tied decision produced by the court, as the Senate continues to block Mr Obama's nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. Analysis - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington The deadlocked decision in US v Texas is the clearest example to date of the impact that Justice Antonin Scalia's death has had on the US Supreme Court - and, consequently, on the direction of US public policy writ large. The court's inability to find a majority either supporting President Barack Obama's unilateral executive action on immigration or striking it down means the whole controversy heads back into the lap of a lower-level conservative judge in Texas. While those judicial gears slowly grind away, the US has a presidential election to conduct in just over four months. If the Senate continues to drag its feet on confirming Mr Obama's pick for the high court, Merrick Garland, the next president could not only set US immigration policy but also pick the justice who will likely be the deciding vote if and when those decisions once again reach the Supreme Court. Given that US voters are choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, the disposition of the immigration issue for generations to come is in the balance. As if the stakes in the US presidential election weren't high enough already. The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) initiatives had been on hold since 2015 as the court considered the programmes' legality. DAPA was considered particularly controversial as it allows the parents of US citizens and permanent residents to remain in the county for up to three years and apply for work permits. Lawyers for the state of Texas argued that state governments would be overburdened by having to spend more on public services with the addition of the undocumented residents. The lack of ruling leaves the legal status of about four million undocumented immigrants in limbo. President Obama's unilateral action would have allowed migrants to obtain work permits and would block them from deportation while their citizenship status was being determined by lawmakers. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton called the courts deadlocked opinion ""unacceptable"" and said that immigrants ""enrich our communities and contribute to our economy every day"". ""We should be doing everything possible under the law to provide them relief from the spectre of deportation,"" Mrs Clinton said in a statement. Republican lawmaker Paul Ryan applauded the Supreme Court for making ""the president's executive action on immigration null and void"". ""The Constitution is clear: The president is not permitted to write laws, only Congress is."" Mr Ryan, the top-ranking elected Republican, is at odds with the party's presidential nominee-to-be Donald Trump over his plans to build a wall on the southern border paid for by Mexico. What is in Obama's plan?",The Supreme Court has announced it is split on President Barack Obama’s plan to shield millions of undocumented immigrants living illegally in the US.
"By Carine TorbeyBBC Arabic, Beirut Some 17 official days off in this year's calendar is one of the upsides to living here, and its explanation lies in Lebanon's complex political system and patchwork of religions. Like almost every other institutional arrangement, the public holidays are designed to maintain the fragile balance between the different sects in the country. Most public holidays are religious ones. Lebanon has 18 official sects and a political system which is based on a sectarian division of power. Therefore, religious sensitivities help explain the relatively high number of public holidays. While other countries which celebrate Easter, for example, get one Easter holiday, Lebanon gets two. The religious calendars of both Orthodox and Catholic Christians must be honoured. The same goes for the Eid al-Fitr holiday at the end of Ramadan. Since Shia and Sunni Muslims often dispute the timing of start of Ramadan and the date of Eid al-Fitr, Lebanon gets a double Ramadan holiday, or an extended one. Lebanese public holidays, 2016 There is also a national holiday on 6 January. The date is Christmas Day for Armenians, who are more of an ethnic minority than a separate religious group. But Lebanon's political system only functions in terms of sect. Therefore, the Armenian Lebanese are considered as a sect of their own. Rare phenomenon The list of public holidays is long. It includes Christmas, Eid al-Adha, Ashura, the Assumption of Virgin Mary and the Feast of the Annunciation. This last one holds a special status. It marks the moment when the Angel Gabriel told Mary that she would become the mother of Jesus. Islam and Christianity fundamentally disagree on the nature of Jesus, but they share the belief in that moment. Therefore, the Feast of the Annunciation is officially a Christian and Muslim holiday. Of course, all citizens are granted all holidays regardless of their religious denomination. And to avoid any sensitivity, the number of Christian public holidays must correspond as closely as possible to the number of Muslim public holidays. A mismatch could risk signalling that one group has an upper hand over the other and cause upset. The holidays, though, are not fixed and sometimes there are anomalies. This year for example, the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad will be celebrated twice: in January and again in December. It happens only once every 33 years. The reason is to do with the length of the Hijri (Islamic) calendar, which is 11 days shorter than the Gregorian (Christian) calendar. For Muslims the December birthday of the Prophet falls on the 24th, also Christmas Eve. Such a convergence gives a strong boost to those who celebrate pluralism and coexistence in Lebanon. 'Scrap Good Friday' In a multi-confessional state, religious public holidays have become an almost sacred right; what is at stake here is the pride of the sect and those who belong to it. A few years ago, an attempt was made to reduce the number of public holidays. One suggestion was to scrap Good Friday from the holiday agenda. The proposal was vehemently rejected by indignant Christians. The Christian MPs who did not object were severely criticised by their own supporters. Good Friday remains a public holiday, celebrated twice, except for the years when Orthodox Christians and Catholics agree on the same Lent calendar. For all their benefits, however, having so many public holidays also has its downsides. Waiting for a money transfer, finalising an official procedure, or having to depend on local services for an unfinished piece of work might be even more frustrating when holidays become an obstacle. But the purpose of preserving the equal rights of each sect and projecting a sense of national cohesion seems to take precedence and inconveniences are hardly noted. Besides, Lebanon has deeper troubles. Its institutions have been almost paralysed for a year. The country is without a president and the government is barely functioning. A few extra days off are not likely to have a significant impact. If anything, they lift the mood of the nation.","As the May Day holiday is marked around the world, for Lebanon it is just one of many in a country which enjoys more public holidays than anywhere else in the region."
"The ruling also applies to two other separatist Catalan politicians - Toni Comín and Clara Ponsatí. All three fled Spain in 2017, when Madrid moved to thwart Catalonia's independence bid and prosecuted them. Ms Ponsatí is in Scotland; the others are in Belgium. Spain accuses them of ""rebellion"" and abuse of public funds. Last month Spain's central election commission, the JEC, had barred the three from appearing on the ballot, arguing that they were not residing in Spain. The JEC decision followed a complaint from two Spanish parties opposed to Catalan independence: the conservative Popular Party (PP) and pro-business Ciudadanos. However, the JEC also admitted that the charge of ""rebellion"" was not listed in the electoral law among possible reasons for barring a candidate from the European elections. Legal minefield Under EU law, parliamentary immunity covers MEPs once they have been elected to the European Parliament and are exercising their duties. But the clauses on immunity, in Protocol 7 of the EU Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, do not cover a candidate prior to his/her confirmation as an elected MEP. So the Catalan candidates could still face arrest in Spain if they go home to campaign ahead of the 26 May election. They also refuse to recognise the Spanish constitution, making it problematic for them to serve as Spanish MEPs. Mr Puigdemont was in triumphant mood, in a tweet (in Catalan), saying ""there is very good legal work behind each victory achieved"". He and the other Catalan separatists are in the pro-independence coalition Junts per Catalunya (JuntsXCat). They aim to join a pan-European parliamentary group representing nationalists, called European Free Alliance (EFA).","The pro-independence former leader of Catalonia, Carles Puigdemont, can run for election to the European Parliament this month, a Madrid court has ruled."
"People have been advised to wear face coverings during the second Covid-19 lockdown on the island. Jaime Amoedo, of the PlasticBusters group, said face masks and gloves accounted for about 40% of all litter collected on the Isle of Man since extra restrictions began on 7 January. Fighting Covid-19 should not come at a cost to the environment, he added. Although masks are only mandatory on public transport, the Manx government has ""strongly advised"" people to wear them when in public places. Many supermarkets require them to be used. Mr Amoedo said the irresponsible disposal of masks and gloves was ""worse this time"" than during the island's first lockdown, when the use of masks was not encouraged. Discarded masks and gloves posed a danger to wildlife and a potential ""health risk"" to children who might pick them up, he added. Environment Minister Geoffrey Boot said face coverings had an ""important role"" in fighting Covid-19 but must not be allowed to pollute the environment. The island began easing lockdown restrictions on Saturday with some construction workers allowed to return to work and socially distant outdoor meetings permitted. The restrictions are due to be lifted entirely on 1 February, provided there are no new community cases of the virus. Some 432 people have tested positive for coronavirus on the island since March, 25 of whom have died. There are currently 30 active cases. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

"Ms Lewinsky was 22 when she became romantically involved with the then president, who was 27 years her senior. She has written an article for Vanity Fair magazine, reflecting on events after the #MeToo movement. She also revealed that she was diagnosed with PTSD after the scandal. The condition was caused by being ""publicly outed and ostracised"" as the affair unravelled in the press and courts, she says. News of their relationship dominated the US news agenda in 1998 and 1999, after the president initially denied it before admitting to ""inappropriate intimate physical contact"" with the former White House intern. House Republicans impeached the president, arguing he had lied to federal investigators, but Mr Clinton was acquitted in the Senate. He remained in power until 2001. In the magazine piece, Ms Lewinsky, now 44, says she stands by her 2014 comments that their relationship was consensual, but muses about the ""vast power differentials"" that existed between the two. Ms Lewinsky says she had ""limited understanding of the consequences"" at the time, and regrets the affair daily. ""The dictionary definition of ""consent""? To give permission for something to happen,"" she wrote. ""And yet what did the 'something' mean in this instance, given the power dynamics, his position, and my age?...He was my boss. He was the most powerful man on the planet. He was 27 years my senior, with enough life experience to know better."" Since re-emerging into the public eye in 2014, Ms Lewinsky has regularly spoken out publicly against cyberbullying, calling herself ""patient zero"" of the internet trend. #MeToo movement In the Vanity Fair essay, she also discusses the growing movement of women publicly speaking out against sexual harassment and assault. She writes that she was moved to tears after being contacted by one of the leaders of the #MeToo movement, who expressed sympathy that Ms Lewinsky was ""so alone"" during the affair. ""Isolation is such a powerful tool to the subjugator. And yet I don't believe I would have felt so isolated had it all happened today,"" she writes. ""There are even some people who feel my White House experiences don't have a place in this movement, as what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognise that it constituted a gross abuse of power.""","Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had an affair with former president Bill Clinton, has said their relationship constituted a ""gross abuse of power"" on his part."
"But now the government is clamping down, in order to promote local design. A government statement says ""plagiarising, imitating, and copycatting"" designs is prohibited in new public facilities. The statement says buildings ""reveal a city's culture"" - and that ""large, foreign, and weird"" designs should be limited. The guidelines also clamp down on new skyscrapers - limiting them, in general, to a maximum of 500 metres. According to the Global Times, the ""fake, shoddy versions"" of foreign buildings appear in ""many third and fourth-tier Chinese cities"". The government did not say what will happen to existing ""foreign"" buildings, but does say there will be ""city inspections"" to check for problems. The statement, issued on 27 April but only reported this week, singles out stadiums, exhibition centres, museums and theatres as public facilities where it's especially important to ban plagiarism. ""City constructions are the combination of a city's external image and internal spirit, revealing a city's culture,"" the government statement says. It calls for a ""new era"" of architecture to ""strengthen cultural confidence, show the city's features, exhibit the contemporary spirit, and display the Chinese characteristics"". The guidelines on ""foreign"" architecture were mostly welcomed on Chinese social media. ""The ban is great,"" wrote a Weibo user, according to state media the Global Times. ""It's much better to protect our historical architectures than build fake copycat ones."" Another recalled seeing an imitation White House in Jiangsu province. ""It burned my eyes,"" she said. In 2013, the BBC visited ""Thames Town"", an imitation English town in Songjiang in Shanghai. The town features cobbled streets, a medieval meeting hall - even a statue of Winston Churchill - and was a popular spot for wedding photos. ""Usually if you want to see foreign buildings, you have to go abroad,"" said one person. ""But if we import them to China, people can save money while experiencing foreign-style architecture."" China, of course, is not the only country to borrow - or copy - other countries' designs. Las Vegas in the US revels in its imitations of iconic foreign architecture including the Eiffel Tower and Venetian canals. Thailand also has developments that mimic the Italian countryside and charming English villages, mainly aimed at domestic tourists.","From English towns, to Alpine villages, to the Eiffel Tower - copies of foreign architecture can be seen across China."
"Mr Delaney, who lives in London and is best known for starring in the British sitcom Catastrophe, announced the ""very sad news"" in a Facebook post on Friday. ""I will endeavour to not go mad with grief,"" he wrote, adding: ""We had so many wonderful adventures together."" Henry's brain tumour was diagnosed in 2016, shortly after his first birthday. Mr Delaney, 41, said that at the time Henry was suffering from ""persistent vomiting and weight loss"". After he was admitted to an NHS hospital, doctors discovered the tumour and Henry underwent surgery to remove it. He had further treatment last year but the cancer returned and Henry died in January, Mr Delaney wrote. ""His tumour and surgery left him with significant physical disabilities, but he quickly learned sign language and developed his own method of getting from A to B, shuffling on his beautiful little bum,"" he added in his post. The comedian went on to praise the work of NHS nurses and doctors along with others who had helped care for his son, who he said had spent 15 months in hospital. Mr Delaney said that all those who ""helped our family survive Henry's illness"" were ""my heroes until the day I die"".

"He is serving his sentence in a prison near the Arctic Circle after being convicted in 2010 at a trial dismissed by supporters as politically motivated. A Moscow court cited legal changes in reducing the term. Responding to the news, Khodorkovsky's lawyer said his client was ""innocent and should be released immediately"". The former head of oil giant Yukos was convicted of fraud and tax evasion at his first trial in 2005. Khodorkovsky's business partner, Platon Lebedev, has also had his sentence cut by two years. At their second trial in 2010, they were both sentenced to 13 years, to run from the date of their arrest in 2003. In one of his final acts before leaving office as Russian president this year, Dmitry Medvedev ordered a review of the sentences imposed on Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and 30 others. 'Lynching' Khodorkovsky's convictions have been widely seen abroad as political revenge for him defying the Kremlin by backing Russia's opposition politicians against Vladimir Putin, who was re-elected as president in March after a gap of four years. Mr Putin himself denied on Thursday that the case against Khodorkovsky had been driven by politics or personal revenge. ""There has been no personal prosecution,"" he said during his annual news conference. ""I remember very well how this case developed. Everyone tries to present it as a political case but what? Was Mikhail Borisovich [Khodorkovsky] involved in politics? Was he a member of parliament?"" The prisoner's lawyer, Vadim Klyuvgant, told Reuters news agency: ""Those two years [off the sentence] were a little human relief. ""It's one-seventh of a 14-year [sentence]... The rest is a continuation of lawlessness and lynching, covered by court procedures."" The Moscow city court said its decision to reduce the prison sentences from 13 to 11 years was based on a change to Russian laws on economic crimes.",Imprisoned former tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky is due for early release in 2014 after a Russian court cut two years off his term for embezzlement.
"John SimpsonWorld affairs editor I would do my best, trying to work out from the few certainties - election dates, anniversaries and so on - to give an idea what the year might look like. And of course over the following months so many other, wholly unexpected things would happen that my article bore absolutely no resemblance to the real year that was to come. So in the end I gave it up. In our complex, many-centred world, forecasting the future is a mug's game. Who, this time last year, forecast that more-or-less friendly Russia would send its troops into an independent country - Ukraine - and seize an entire section of it - Crimea? Who suggested that the extremists of Islamic State would capture the third biggest city in Iraq, Mosul? And who predicted that by the end of 2014 the oil price would drop to $60 (£40) a barrel, with all that entails for countries right across the world? Dramatic events Plenty of years contain unexpected events along these lines. But one year in particular shows the utter pointlessness of trying to forecast the future: 1989. Although no newspaper and not a single intelligence agency from the CIA to MI6 to the KGB forecast it, by December 1988 the world was standing on the threshold of the greatest change it had seen since World War Two. In 1989 Russia's iron grip over Eastern Europe would simply vanish: Marxism-Leninism was on the point of evaporating. Nowadays we all think it was obvious that this was going to happen. The Soviet Union simply couldn't carry its enormous burdens any longer. We did have some idea of it at the time, of course - but no-one thought the collapse would start so soon. And certainly not in a single evening. When it happened, it was all down to the use of a single word by a tired and flustered politician. Thursday 9 November 1989 seemed like any other day. Fall of Berlin Wall Those of us who were reporting on German affairs were thoroughly aware that East Germany was starting to liberalise its draconian system, but the process seemed to be completely under control. That evening a big crowd of journalists crammed into an unremarkable hall in East Berlin for a news conference by the main spokesman for the East German government. No-one who fussed about trying to find a seat or a place to stand guessed that within minutes the world most of us had grown up in was about to be convulsed. Shortly after 19:00, Gunther Schabowski came bustling in and sat down in front of the microphones. He was a decent, honourable man, a strong advocate of reform and greater democracy who had helped to get rid of the corrupt characters in the old East German Politburo. He talked for a while about the regime's new approach. Then there was an awkward pause. He had managed to mislay the piece of paper with the government's main decision typed out on it. It took some shuffling of documents and the help of an assistant before he found it. ""This will be interesting for you,"" said Mr Schabowski at last. He was clearly rattled. ""Today it was decided to make it possible for all citizens to leave the country through the official border crossing-points. ""All citizens of the German Democratic Republic can now be issued with visas for the purposes of travel or visiting relatives in the West. This order is to take effect at once [unverzuglich]."" Immediately, everyone started talking. What context? A correspondent from East German radio called out: ""What exactly does unverzuglich mean in this context?"" Without really thinking, Mr Schabowski said: ""Well, it just means straightaway."" What the Central Committee had actually decided was that anyone wanting to visit the West could apply for an exit visa. It was intended to be a slow, bureaucratic process, which would be carefully regulated. But Mr Schabowski gave an entirely different impression. The large number of East Berliners who were watching Mr Schabowski live on television assumed he meant they could just head for the Wall and be allowed through to West Berlin. Straightaway. Those who weren't watching, quickly heard from friends of theirs. Within 15 minutes big crowds were streaming towards the crossing-points. Since the guards at the Wall had no orders to shoot, they let them through. Soon people were clambering up on to the top of the Wall, dancing and laughing and kissing each other. The Wall hadn't literally fallen, it had simply ceased to matter. The world had become a different place. Soon, on balance, it would be safer and richer too. And all because of a single four-syllable German word. I ask you: how could anyone conceivably have forecast that?","For many years at around this time, when I was a columnist on a leading British newspaper, my editor would ask me to write an article predicting what was going to happen in the coming year."
"The 44-year-old told medics he was swimming in Lake Placid in Queensland when he was attacked by a saltwater crocodile that he described as being 1.5m to 2m (4.9ft to 6.5ft) long. He was taken to hospital with multiple ""minor lacerations"". Officials said the man was lucky to escape without more serious injuries. Critical care paramedic Paul Sweeney said the man was ""remarkably calm"" when emergency responders arrived at the scene on Thursday. ""What he said to us was that a crocodile had bitten his head and in his effort to remove the jaws of the crocodile, he put his hands in to try and prise the jaws apart. In the process of trying to remove his hands, the jaws snapped shut on his forefinger,"" he told reporters. Mr Sweeney said that following the attack the man swam a considerable distance back to shore and pulled himself onto the bank. ""It was clear from our assessment of him that there were puncture marks [on his head],"" he said. He was later taken to Cairns Hospital, where an official told the BBC he was in a stable condition. Mr Sweeney told reporters the man - who has not been publicly named - had been swimming in the lake three times a week for about eight years, and said he ""would not be surprised if he ventured into those waters again for further exercise"". Queensland Environment Department said it was sending wildlife officers to Lake Placid ""to obtain further information about the nature of the attack and any further management action required"". ""We are reminding people that Lake Placid and the Cairns region are known Croc Country and urge people in the area to always be Crocwise,"" it said. The department said people should expect crocodiles in all far northern Queensland waterways, and urged them to avoid using canoes and kayaks and stand back from the water's edge when fishing, among other guidance.

"The politician, who has served as chief minister four times before, was cheered by supporters as she travelled to the swearing-in ceremony in the state capital, Chennai (Madras). A court sentenced Ms Jayalalitha to four years for corruption last year. But an appeals court overruled this, allowing her to return to politics. As she arrived at Madras University to take oath on Saturday, Ms Jayalalitha was cheered by a large crowd. The colourful politician has been a leading figure in south Indian politics for three decades. 'Amma is back' The former film actress enjoys enormous popularity in Tamil Nadu, where fans know her simply as ""Amma"" or mother. Dressed in an emerald green sari, she took the oath in Tamil while her 28 cabinet ministers stood behind her. Hundreds of supporters held up her photo and danced to the chant, ""Amma is back"". Ms Jayalalitha's political return comes after she was convicted and sentenced for four years by a trial court last September. She was found guilty of amassing unaccounted-for wealth of more than $10m (£6.4m) and had to quit as the chief minister. The appeals court ruling earlier this month paved the way for her returning as the head of Tamil Nadu government. On Friday morning, Tamil Nadu Governor K Rosaiah's office said in a statement that Mr O Panneerselvam, party leader and loyalist who headed the government in her absence, resigned along with his cabinet ministers. The governor accepted the resignations and invited Ms Jayalalitha to form a government ""at the earliest"", the statement added.

"Three survivors tell the BBC how they are coping in the aftermath of the attack.

""At first we didn't believe it was gunfire but when I saw the singer go off stage, I looked at my girlfriend and said, 'Run'.

""Last week, I finally went down to the memorial at the Las Vegas sign. That was rough - if you are a survivor or victim I highly suggest not going. I had to leave because I became so angry. ""Unless you were there, you would never understand the chaos and carnage we experienced. Soon after the tragedy, conspiracy theorists accused survivors of being actors in a staged event. Asked about that, Russell said: ""I just found dried blood on my watch. I don't want to hear it! After weeks of disturbed sleep, Russell said he decided to deal with the nightmares he was experiencing by facing his fears head on. ""I thought I could never attend a concert again but couldn't say no to seeing Beatles legend Ringo Starr and his All-Star Band on Friday. ""I completely broke down multiple times.

'It's unbearable' Crystal Huber from Long Beach, California, was with a group of family and friends at the festival. As they escaped from the area, they helped three victims to get medical help and ferried a large number of people away from the scene in a truck. The day after the attack she said she was ""baffled"" at the growing conspiracy theories about the tragedy and wrote on Facebook: ""Let me explain something for people who clearly don't get it, last night was complete and utter chaos to say the least... most of us didn't fully know what was going on until hours later when the police confirmed what was true and what was not. This is what happens when you're in a state of shock and panic and you're running scared for your life. ""So just stop already with the conspiracy ideas... have some respect for people who experienced this in real life and not just in social media!"" A week on from the shooting she posted a Facebook message which read: ""Today was harder than others! I think something inside of all of us broke all over again tonight at 22:05. The anxiety leading up to it was insane. So many lives were changed by this time last week, it's unbearable."" Since then she's been trying to get life back to normal for herself and her young daughter, adding: ""I've been keeping busy at work but it's still been hard for us all emotionally. We have been working through it day by day though.""

"In the heat of the cruel south Indian summer, Sridevi cut a cool figure. It was the early 1990s and she was in a white, flowing dress in the famous Prasad Studios in Chennai (Madras), the city that spawned her career. Tall and statuesque, she was almost regal, her hair styled to resemble a cloud - as was the fashion at the time. As a young reporter, I found her sitting on set between takes of a Bollywood song-and-dance sequence, ready for the interview, her expression giving away nothing. Despite my prodding her monosyllabic answers shed no light on her life in Bollywood and she remained painfully shy of opening up. But on screen Sridevi - who was known by her first name, like most south Indian actors - was very different. With a filmography of close to 300 movies in at least five Indian languages, she held her own as a leading lady, a box office magnet from the 1970s to the late 1990s. Sridevi's life on screen began with a successful early stint performing in all the four south Indian film languages and she graduated to an extraordinary career in Bollywood, where she knew neither the language nor the culture of the Hindi film industry. When she took a break from films, after her marriage to producer Boney Kapoor in 1996, Sridevi was rumoured to be the highest paid in her field and her star power and charisma persisted for years to come. She embodied feminine mystique and that classic screen-goddess combination of beauty, mystery and intrigue. She lit up the screen with her vivacity and charm, while off it she remained fiercely private. Film directors repeatedly spoke in awe of her acting prowess, which followed no method but sheer intuition and instinct as she sparkled before the cameras and retreated into a shell when the lights were off. A fluid, performing talent Like film legend Greta Garbo, the Art Deco icon of her times, Sridevi was glamorous and beautiful but reclusive and intensely private. Her glittering costumes and dazzling presence on screen, coupled with her sculpted dance performances in Hindi movies, found die-hard fans among young girls and women. Her burlesque comic acts and vaudeville capers in films such as Mr India and Chaalbaaz delighted adults and children alike. And her vulnerable sex appeal brought her female and male adulation, while her intuitive skill for acting made her a box-office sensation in Bollywood. Sridevi's screen career began at the age of four in a 1969 Tamil-language film. The eldest daughter of a small-time Tamil lawyer and a Telugu-speaking mother, she had an active career as a child actor. At just 13 she was cast in the role of a woman avenging her lover's death and as the young wife of an older man in the Tamil film Moondru Mudichu (Marriage). Sridevi's fan base is fiercely regional, too. Her south Indian fans claim that her best acting phase was in the southern language films, especially Tamil and Telugu, where she played unglamorous and complicated roles. Notable film roles include: However, Sridevi's fans in the north say it was her Bollywood career that really allowed her charisma and glamour to shine. In 2012, her comeback Bollywood film English Vinglish was a huge hit, once again cashing in on her unique combination of charisma and fluid acting talent. She notched up several awards, including the Padma Shri, India's fourth highest civilian honour. Heartbreak and loss Sridevi's screen profile was glamorous but her private life was one of heartbreak, loss and estrangement. The Bollywood gossip mill relentlessly spoke of her not being good at conversation, and listed her romantic liaisons and heartbreaks - as well as her bouts of cosmetic surgery. Her secret wedding in 1996 led to a 16-year hiatus in her film career. She turned to family life and gave birth to two daughters, Jhanvi and Khushi. In recent years she had taken up a variety of roles - and her sudden death at a family wedding in Dubai - has come as a huge shock to India. Her fans will be devastated to learn that the cause of death was accidental drowning, according to a Dubai forensics report. But in the hours before she died Sridevi's Instagram posts were alive with her pictures. Bejewelled and in shimmering couture, her glittering smile lit up the screen as it always had. Sudha G Tilak is a Delhi-based independent journalist","India is mourning screen icon Sridevi Kapoor, who has died aged 54. Her rise to stardom was an extraordinary chapter in the country's film industry, writes Sudha G Tilak."
"Social alienation was seen as a factor in this month's attacks by jihadist gunmen, who killed 17 people in Paris. Mr Valls proposed ""a population policy, to fight against ghettoisation, segregation"". He criticised ""apartheid"" in France - a word suggesting racism. He urged France to ""recognise reality"". Mr Valls has promised hundreds of extra police intelligence agents and new equipment to help tackle terrorism. Three French gunmen from ethnic minority backgrounds carried out the terror attacks on 7-9 January, targeting Charlie Hebdo magazine, police and a Jewish supermarket. France's deprived banlieues (suburbs), blighted by high unemployment, have long been seen as breeding grounds for political and religious extremists. ""As a republican I cannot stand seeing this closing-off, this banishment... nor the fact that in some schools you only find children from poor families, often one-parent families, only from immigrant backgrounds, from the same culture and same religion,"" Mr Valls complained. Officially France is against the development of ethnic enclaves, as it seeks to promote assimilation, not multiculturalism. In 2005 a wave of rioting engulfed many French suburbs, originating in Clichy-sous-Bois, on the eastern outskirts of Paris.","French Prime Minister Manuel Valls says France must no longer tolerate ""ghettoisation"", with suburban schools where all the children are from poor, ethnic minority families."
"At the annual Havana Jazz Festival, the audience members, much like the music, were a mix of international and Cuban. Sitting on plastic chairs at the open-air venue, visitors from the United States, Europe and China mingled with local jazz aficionados. On stage, a saxophonist who lives in Denmark was reunited with some old Cuban friends. At such an international event, the common language is generally English. Many Cubans are already learning the language themselves, and if not, they are trying to make sure their children are. 'Nyet' to Russian Morning assembly at Jesus Suarez Gayol Secondary School on the outskirts of Havana begins with the school's anthem. The school is named after one of the guerrillas who fought alongside Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara but these teenagers are growing up in an increasingly different Cuba to the one Jesus Suarez did. For a start, a certain proficiency in English is now a requirement for all secondary school children and university graduates. During the Cold War, students could choose between learning English and Russian but Cuba's educational authorities told the BBC they now consider English a necessary skill for all of the nation's youth. ""As an international language, English has always had a place in our curriculum,"" says Director of Secondary Education Zoe de la Red Iturria. ""But we are now rolling out new techniques to evolve our learning of the English language,"" she adds. But language-teaching methods remain quite traditional, relying heavily on textbooks, parrot-fashion repetition and with only very limited Internet access. Olga Perez, national adviser for English teaching in Cuba, says the authorities are hoping to tackle that last issue. ""It would be very good for us if we had the internet in the schools. And we hope that in the future, we'll not only have the internet, we're also dreaming of installing language laboratories in every school."" And it is not just in the classrooms that English can be heard more frequently but on the streets of Havana, too. Making conversation In what was a record year for tourism to Cuba, many Cubans have tried to teach themselves English without the help of any formal classes. Darvis Luis sells second-hand books and posters to tourists. He says he learnt English entirely through computer games, music videos and rock songs. ""I have to make conversation because I need to make money to eat,"" he says in easy-flowing, fast English. ""I have to learn how to speak with them and I have to get better and better. I tell them a story because books aren't so easy to sell. So you have to make them believe in what you're saying."" Resources for Anglophiles and budding English-language students like Darvis Luis are limited in Cuba. One place they can go is Cuba Libro, the island's only English-language bookstore. Nestled in the leafy Havana district of Vedado, it is the brainchild of US healthcare journalist and long-time Havana resident Conner Gorry. Ms Gorry says that after some initial misgivings, local residents ""welcomed us with open arms"" once they saw ""the free cultural programming, high-quality literature and community outreach"" on offer. ""Literature is not subversive,"" she says. ""A Cuban government-run publishing house just published George Orwell's 1984 and that's available in state-run bookstores."" ""With increased tourism and increased business connections to the wider world, the Cubans are encouraging people to learn English. So we've become a resource,"" she adds. In the past months, as well as the jazz festival, Havana has hosted the annual film festival and the international ballet festival. It is at events like these that the thaw in relations with the US seems clearer than ever. The decision by the Obama Administration and the Castro government to rebuild their diplomatic ties has undeniably brought Cubans and Americans closer together. It has also brought about some potentially lasting collaboration in science and the arts. There are people on both sides who fear those steps could soon be reversed, especially in light of comments made to that effect by President-elect Donald Trump. For now though, the young students at Jesus Suarez are just keen to keep improving their ability to communicate with the rest of the world.","As Cuba slowly opens up its economy to the rest of the world, more and more Cubans are learning English. The Cuban government has made proficiency in English a requirement for all high school and university students. As Will Grant reports from Havana, that approach differs from the Cold War, when Russian was the preferred foreign language."
"His death was announced by France's Holocaust Memorial Foundation. Born in Strasbourg to a Jewish family, he was captured by the Nazis in 1940 but escaped. One of the methods he used to save children was to take them to the Swiss border, then kick a football over the frontier and get them to chase it. ""I spotted a football pitch that was on the border. It was made up of fences two-and-a-half metres high. I saw that there was nobody,"" he said. ""I made the children play, I told some of them to lift up the fences and I passed the ball."" Loinger was serving in the French army when he was caught in 1940 but his blond hair and blue eyes apparently concealed the fact he was Jewish from his German captors and this enabled his escape from a prisoner of war camp. Returning to France during the war he joined an aid agency trying to help Jewish children whose parents had been killed or sent to concentration camps. Another method he used involved dressing children as mourners and taking them to a cemetery on the French-Swiss border, where they would climb up a gravedigger's ladder to neutral territory. He is thought to have saved more than 350 children. Loinger's cousin was another French resistance fighter, the mime artist Marcel Marceau.","French resistance fighter Georges Loinger, whose bravery and invention saved hundreds of Jewish children in World War Two, has died aged 108."
"More than 100 others were being treated, 20 of whom were very ill, said lawmaker William Ojeda from the governing Socialist Party. After breaking into the facility, the prisoners are reported to have consumed a variety of medicines. They had been protesting about conditions in the jail. Mr Ojeda said the inmates at Uribana prison near the north-western city of Barquisimeto had ingested a combination of anti-seizure drugs, insulin, antibiotics and hypertension treatments. Relatives outside the jail have accused prison wardens of poisoning the inmates. The chief prosecutor's office said it wanted to question the prison director over the deaths. The incident was first reported on Thursday, when the authorities said that 13 inmates had died. Venezuela has one of the highest crime and homicide rates in Latin America, and the judicial system is struggling to cope with the caseload. The prison population has been increasing with many of those incarcerated waiting for trial. Most prisons in Venezuela are run by armed inmates, with the security forces having little or no control, says pressure group Venezuelan Prison Observatory.","Thirty-five prisoners in north-west Venezuela have died after overdosing on the contents of a jail infirmary they stormed, a congressman says."
"The money was used to monitor Mr Assange's visitors, embassy staff and UK police, media reports in the UK and Ecuador said. Mr Assange has been at the embassy since 2012 after being granted asylum. He fled there to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex crime allegations, which he denies. The Swedish authorities have since dropped their investigation, but Britain is still seeking his arrest for breaching bail conditions. Mr Assange, 46, believes he will be extradited to the US for questioning over the activities of WikiLeaks if he leaves the building. He set up Wikileaks, which publishes confidential documents and images, in 2006 - making headlines around the world in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. What did Ecuador say? In a brief statement, it said: ""The president of the republic, Lenín Moreno, has ordered that any additional security at the Ecuadorian embassy in London be withdrawn immediately."" It added that the mission would now ""maintain normal security similar to that of other Ecuadorian embassies"". It follows reports in the Guardian newspaper and Focus Ecuador that the operation, called ""Operation Guest"" and later ""Operation Hotel"", cost about $66,000 a month. In March, Ecuador cut Mr Assange's internet connection at the London embassy, preventing him from communicating with the outside world. The move was to prevent Mr Assange from interfering in other countries' affairs, Ecuador said. It came after Mr Assange had questioned accusations that Moscow was responsible for the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter in the UK on 4 March. Last May, Mr Moreno asked Mr Assange to refrain from expressing his public support for the independence campaign in Spain's Catalonia region after he tweeted that Madrid was guilty of ""repression"". Mr Assange's Twitter account is now being run by his legal campaign. Why is Assange still at Ecuador's London embassy?",Ecuador has removed extra security at its London embassy following claims that $5m (£3.7m) was spent to protect WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
"Lois Lerner said she had done nothing wrong but invoked her constitutional right not to incriminate herself. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has apologised for the practice but denies its staff had political motivations. The practice has been widely condemned and the FBI has launched an inquiry. ""I have done nothing wrong,"" Ms Lerner, the IRS director of exempt organisations, told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The committee on Tuesday held the third of several planned congressional hearings on the matter. 'No answers' ""I have not broken any laws,"" she said. ""I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations and I have not provided false information to this or any other committee."" Oversight committee chairman Darrell Issa, a Republican, has accused Ms Lerner of providing ""false or misleading"" information to the IRS about its practices. But when Mr Issa asked her to reconsider her decision to invoke the Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination, Ms Lerner said, ""I will not answer any questions or testify about the subject matter of this committee's meeting."" Ms Lerner, whose office processes applications for tax-exempt status, was excused nine minutes after she began speaking. Mr Issa said he might consider recalling her if she could be granted immunity. Even before the matter came to light this month, congressmen had asked tax officials whether conservative groups were being treated unfairly, after lawmakers received complaints from constituents. But IRS officials denied any targeting was going on. Two top IRS officials have tendered their resignations over the matter and the FBI has launched a criminal probe. It has also emerged that White House chief of staff Denis McDonough was aware the US treasury department had launched an inquiry into the matter, but did not inform the president. Keywords In 2010-12, the IRS says it was inundated with new applications from groups seeking tax-exempt status, after the US Supreme Court loosened restrictions on political spending by organisations unaffiliated with candidates' campaigns Under US tax law, ""social welfare"" groups may apply for tax-exempt status but cannot engage primarily in political activity. Staff members at an IRS office in Cincinnati, Ohio are understood to have compiled a list that included keywords such as ""Tea Party"" and ""patriot"" to select organisations for extra scrutiny from the large number of applications. The Tea Party is a loosely organised movement of anti-tax conservatives, and in the American political lexicon ""patriot"" can indicate a conservative orientation. The US treasury department's inspector general for tax matters said his investigation found no evidence the IRS had acted under political pressure from the White House, and officials have said the practice was an effort to handle the heavy workload.",The US tax official who runs the office whose staff targeted conservative groups for extra scrutiny ahead of the 2012 election has refused to testify in a congressional hearing.
"Deputy-elect Jonathan Le Tocq is the only candidate left, following Deputy Trott's withdrawal on Wednesday. However, a proposal to change the criteria for eligibility will now be debated immediately before the new deputies make their choice. Asked if he would consider standing if the rules changed, Deputy Trott said: ""Never rule anything out in politics."" ""You must never say never because these things are very much movable feasts,"" he said. ""It's clear that many in the States believe that change is important and whilst I would agree that change often renews and refreshes, there is absolutely no substitute for experience,"" he told BBC Guernsey. Emergency report Deputy-elect Peter Harwood had his nomination refused by the Bailiff during the official nomination period. He is currently ineligible on the grounds that he has not served as a people's deputy for four or more years out of the last eight. However, an emergency report by the States Assembly and Constitution Committee seeks to remove that bar, opening the potential field to all 47 States members. Currently, only 23 deputies are eligible. The newly elected States assembly will choose a new chief minister on 1 May.",Guernsey Chief Minister Lyndon Trott has declined to rule out standing for re-election to the post.
