"By Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter, BBC News Footfall across shops in England, many of which have been closed for a month,rose by 86.6% compared with last Wednesday, said analyst Springboard. The uplift is bigger than the rise in footfall seen after the first, longer lockdown ended in June. But Springboard said shoppers were eager to get out and enjoy Christmas. ""People need and want to buy presents and they want to get out and experience Christmas,"" said Diane Wehrle, marketing & insights director at Springboard. ""Also we do have this lockdown fatigue. We've been confined to our houses and not been able to go out and I think we're getting more used to living with Covid."" The day on which lockdown ended in June saw footfall increase by 37%, below the bounce back recorded after the most recent restrictions in England. Ms Wehrle said: ""In June, [Covid] was still very, very new. It really shocked people and they were absolutely terrified. ""People understand it a little bit better now and know what their own personal parameters are."" However, footfall is still far below that of 2019, down almost a quarter compared with the same day last year. And Barclaycard said spending on so-called ""wild Wednesday"" had fallen 13.8% short of purchases made on Black Friday last week. Rob Cameron, chief executive of Barclaycard Payments, said: ""Even with some stores staying open until much later this evening, it's looking unlikely that today will overtake Black Friday. ""Instead, retailers will probably have to wait until Saturday - the first non-working day following stores reopening this week - to hit that milestone."" Shops across England reopened their doors on Wednesday, with the majority of regions under tier 2 Covid-19 restrictions. They limit social contact between households, but allow non-essential stores to reopen. Primark restarted trading early, at 07:00 on Wednesday. At the Trafford Centre in Manchester, it attracted about 100 shoppers at the start of trading. 'Holy grail' Zoe Inman, centre director at the Trafford Centre, she was not disappointed with the numbers: ""It is what we expected."" But she said she was hopeful that the UK's approval of the Pfizer/BioBTech vaccine could help restore some normality. The UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination. Ms Inman hailed the vaccine as a ""holy grail"". ""We've been waiting for this news for so long,"" she said. ""I think once we get that vaccine, we can be more like life as normal, so we do welcome that."" Some people braved the cold to queue from the early hours of Wednesday morning to beat an anticipated rush of shoppers. Emily Harrison in Birmingham, who had come to buy baby clothes, said she'd been ""dreading it"", but added: ""I'm glad it's not busy because I hate when it's busy, so hopefully it'll stay quiet."" Karen Marsh, a mental health nurse in Manchester, said she wanted to come to the shops for Christmas presents: ""So it's that bit extra special thought rather than ordering online."" ""I thought, 'I'm going to come out for a day, boost my mental health, do a bit of shopping, get everything I need, just to boost how I feel,'"" she said. ""Its so important,"" said Sam Watson, general manager of Selfridges in Birmingham. ""Whilst online trading has been brilliant, nothing beats that experience of having customers in the store shopping for their Christmas gifts."" 'So difficult' Laura Knight, who runs independent retailer Tinkers Treasures in Bishop Auckland, said it had been ""so difficult"" to close during November. ""It is one of the busiest months of retail for trade so in December we really need to get people out and spending money to see us through,"" she said. It comes as another Bonmarché became the latest High Street retailer to collapse, following Topshop owner Arcadia and Debenhams. Earlier this week, the department store chain said it would close its doors after failing to secure a buyer. It is likely its 12,000 staff will lose their jobs. Debenhams saw queues outside some of its stores after announcing its collapse earlier this week, Online, long queues also formed for Debenhams' website and by mid-morning the site had crashed altogether.","""Lockdown fatigue"" and the lure of Christmas tempted people back into shops on Wednesday as non-essential stores in England re-opened."
"By Joe MillerBBC News, Davos Well, perhaps not if you lived in a major city. In the UK, for example, London and many other cities voted to remain in the EU, while Hillary Clinton won most of urban America on 8 November. In France, Germany and the Netherlands, far-right movements are weaker in capital cities than they are in many rural areas. And although the divide between city and country is nothing new, the events of the past few months have put their political schisms into sharp relief - a development that has not gone unnoticed at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. ""2016 saw a number of nation states move to the right, and a number of cities move to the left,"" says Michael Berkowitz, who heads the Rockefeller Foundation's 100 Resilient Cities, a $164m initiative that works to bolster urban areas. In a fight between the two, he adds, ""it is unclear who would win."" Trump, China and Brexit to dominate Davos China goes big in Davos - and here's why Davos: Are the global elite in retreat? Davos coverage in full If the image of city and state trading blows seems a little apocalyptic today, in a few months it could be all too real. New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, has vowed to defy the incoming US administration if it tries to deport the city's undocumented immigrants - even if the White House retaliates by pulling federal funding. Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Denver have promised similar resistance. '13 Indias' This impending policy gap is just one of the factors that led the Adecco Group, which publishes a list of most competitive countries on the eve of the WEF, to introduce a new cities index in 2017. The new league table, which is topped by Copenhagen, came about after Adecco boss Alain Dehaze was giving a talk in India, describing the country's relative benefits, when one audience member interjected, arguing that there were ""at least 13 distinct Indias"". Differences in infrastructure, education and quality of life can vary drastically between city and country. Madrid, sixth on the cities index, contrasts with Spain, which languishes at 35 on the countries list. ""Young people,"" says Mr Dehaze, ""are choosing cities before the country - they have their own ranking."" Not that Davos is celebrating the triumph of the progressive, modern city-on-a-hill just yet. This year's WEF offers 16 sessions on the subject, many of which address the threats to urban habitats. ""If you look at climate change, cities often are the most vulnerable,"" says Michael Berkowitz. ""They are in river deltas, they are on coastlines, they are in high plains that may be deprived of water."" Culture clashes And though it often seems like cities in the developed world are enjoying the better half of the economic bargain, they are not immune to the forces of globalisation and mechanisation, as demonstrated by Detroit, which suffered an existential crisis when the auto industry moved on. There is also no guarantee that cities would win out in a clash of cultures with the wider country - as Corine Mauch understands well. Ms Mauch, Zurich's first female and openly gay mayor, and a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, is in charge of an international city often at odds with a more conservative rural Switzerland, whose inhabitants often have more in common with Parisians or Berliners than their fellow compatriots. ""It worries me, for sure,"" says the mayor, citing the 2014 referendum in which Swiss people narrowly voted in favour of migration quotas. ""The city of Zurich is the economic motor of Switzerland. We need immigration. ""But we couldn't be Zurich if we didn't have the surrounding regions. When people come to Zurich they also want to go skiing, they want to see the Alps, they want to see the Jungfrau. ""We are profiting from the other regions, and the other regions are profiting from us. It's a functional differentiation."" City lessons Even if she sees an economic equivalence, when it comes to politics, Ms Mauch would prefer her city to be seen as a progressive model. I show the mayor an advert currently displayed in a Zurich train station, featuring a woman in a black burka, emblazoned with the words ""Unkontrolliert einbürgern? NEIN"" (Uncontrolled citizenship? NO), and ask if she see her role as defending her multicultural city against xenophobia. ""I wouldn't talk of defence. This is a war term,"" she says. ""We have to live it, show that it works."" Adecco's Alain Dehaze agrees. ""The value of the study of the city is that the country can also learn from it."" Already, more that 50% of the world's population lives in cities, and as the Rockefeller Foundation's Michael Berkowitz points out, that figure could be as high as 70% by 2050. And whether or not progressive cities win out in the age of Brexit, Trump and rural disaffection, Davos experts are in no doubt that urban policies will be instrumental in shaping the next few decades. ""Cities both present out biggest risk and our greatest opportunity,"" Mr Berkowitz adds. ""Get cities right and you can really change the world.""","2016. The year in which populist forces across the developed world gained momentum, sowing the seeds of nationalism, protesting against mass immigration and rolling back the tide of globalisation."
"The airline says it will not pay any airport fees before the end of BAA's full inquiry, due at the end of March. Many thousands of air passengers were affected in December as Heathrow and other airports temporarily closed, costing the industry millions. BAA said Heathrow's conditions of use provided no basis to withhold charges. Virgin - one of BAA's biggest customers - and other airlines have been critical of the length of time it took to clear planes for take-off following the disruption. But BAA said: ""Heathrow's conditions of use do not provide any basis for Virgin Atlantic or any other airline to withhold airport charges."" Talks continue BAA's new non-executive director, Sir David Begg, launched an inquiry just before Christmas into ""what went wrong"" at Heathrow where flights were grounded for days. A panel of experts from different airports and airlines will judge BAA's ""planning, execution and recovery"". ""BAA announced fairly quickly after this debacle at Heathrow they were going to launch their own independent inquiry with a panel of international experts,"" said John Strickland, an aviation consultant. BAA is due to report at the end of March, and has said it will work with airlines during the inquiry and share the findings of its report. ""I think as part of that process we're very likely to see negotiations going on and some recompense coming to major airline customers such as Virgin Atlantic and British Airways,"" added Mr Strickland. Frustration Heathrow Airport's boss Colin Matthews announced in December that he was to forgo his bonus as he focussed on rebuilding confidence in the airport. At the time, Prime Minister David Cameron said it was understandable there had been extensive disruption given the amount of snow that had fallen. But he added he was frustrated on behalf of all those affected that it was ""taking so long for the situation to improve"". BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said the fees Virgin were withholding were said to amount to less than £10m. Last week, British Airways said the part-closure of UK airports had cost it £50m.","Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic is withholding the fees it pays airport operator BAA because of its ""slow reaction"" to last month's heavy snow."
"In a joint statement, the US and Canada announced that a 25% tariff on steel imports, and of 10% on aluminium, will end in 48 hours. It is widely expected the US and Mexico will make a similar announcement soon. The US implemented the tariffs last year on grounds of ""national security"". Under the agreement, there will be no quotas on how much steel or aluminium the three countries buy from overseas. However, the US and Canada will monitor imports and if a country is determined to be buying in too much, one of the other nations can request a consultation and potentially re-impose tariffs. What does the agreement mean? Getting rid of the tariffs is viewed as a key hurdle to approval for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal which was signed in 2018. It replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. Providing that Washington and Mexico City also announce an agreement to lift levies on steel and aluminium, the US, Mexico and Canada will ask their respective governments to ratify USMCA. Canada also announced that it would lift tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium that it implemented last year in retaliation for the Trump administration's levies. A win awaits for the 'tariff man' Analysis by Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent The spotlight had been on rising trade tensions between the US and China. So America's decision to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium coming from Canada and Mexico was a surprise bit of good news. As it holds the line with China, the US is now pushing forward with a trade deal much closer to home. Remember the USMCA trade agreement - meant to replace NAFTA? No? Hardly a surprise. It has been languishing in the background. For almost a year now these tariffs had been an obstacle to ratification of the deal. Canada and Mexico had vowed not to move ahead as long as they were in place. And several members of Congress had also raised objections. This now raises the odds of it crossing the finishing line, opening up a new era of trade expansion in North America. For Mr Trump, who loves tariffs so much he called himself the 'tariff man', this would be a big win. And who knows, trade peace in North America might even strengthen his hand in negotiations with China. It also targeted US farm goods as well as items like tomato ketchup and household products. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday: ""These tariffs were harming workers and consumers on both sides of the border. As we look at moving forward with the new NAFTA, it didn't make a lot of sense to continue to have tariffs on steel and aluminium between our countries."" What about other countries hit with US tariffs? European Union steel and aluminium exports to the US are still subject to the tariffs, but there has been some good news for trade relations between the two - on Friday President Donald Trump delayed a decision on whether to impose levies on cars and car part imports. The White House has put back the decision by six months to allow more time for trade talks with the European Union and Japan. Tariffs of up to 25% on imported cars and car parts were under consideration. A report by the Commerce Department claimed that imports of foreign-made cars and auto parts into the US were a threat to national security. The report has not been published, but in Friday's announcement Mr Trump cited its findings which conclude that US carmakers are missing out on revenues to invest in research and development (R&D). It said: ""The lag in R&D expenditures by American-owned producers is weakening innovation and, accordingly, threatening to impair our national security."" The president said he agreed with the study's finding that imported cars and trucks were ""weakening our internal economy"". How are US relations with major trading partners? The deal with Canada, as well as the delay in higher tariffs on EU and Japanese cars and auto parts, come at a critical time for the US and China - the world's two biggest economies. On Monday, Beijing implemented retaliatory tariffs on US imports after Mr Trump imposed levies on a further $200bn of Chinese goods, following a breakdown in trade talks between the two nations. The US President characterised it as a ""little squabble"". However, shortly afterwards, Mr Trump declared a ""national emergency"" to protect US computer networks from ""foreign adversaries"". While the announcement did not name any individual companies, it was widely perceived to be directed at Huawei, the Chinese telecoms equipment maker, which has faced claims its products could be used by China for surveillance. Huawei has vehemently denied the allegations.",The US has reached a deal with Canada to lift tariffs on steel and aluminium imports in a move that could lead to approval for a new North American trade deal.
"By Lora JonesBusiness Reporter, BBC News But now they're a topic of government debate, and ""period poverty"" initiatives keep making headlines. Conversations are opening up, and new products are on the market. How much do women and girls spend on period products? In the UK, it's estimated that the period product market was worth £265.8m ($350.4m) in 2017, according to retail researchers Mintel. Tampon, menstrual pad and panty liner purchases made up most of the spend. But consumers have been spending less, with sales dropping by £5.7m since 2016. Hera Crossan, research analyst at Mintel, said that the drop was down to supermarkets cutting their prices to attract more shoppers, rather than people cutting down on what they are buying. According to the charity Bloody Good Period, the average lifetime spend on period products adds up to around £4,800. Are reusable products becoming more popular? While tampons and pads are popular options for managing periods, Instagram and Facebook users might have noticed more adverts for reusable products popping up on their feeds. Reusable period products can include tampon applicators, menstrual cups or cloth pads. Period-proof underwear typically has layers of cotton and waterproof material, so they can be worn instead of (or with) other period products. The number of Google searches for reusable products has increased in recent years, with the menstrual cup proving the most popular. The search engine uses a number out of 100 to represent interest in a search term. In 2013, the search ""menstrual cup"" had a popularity score of 21, but it has increased to 83 only five years later. Most searches came from Australia, while the United States had the most for reusable menstrual pads. Big retailers like Walmart in the US and Boots in the UK now stock menstrual cups, and some companies have reported that sales have been growing at double digit rates over the last 10 years. What's behind the change? The impact of plastic pollution on the environment has recently been making headlines. In the UK, the government has announced that it would launch a consultation on plastic pollution, potentially increasing the plastic bag fee in England to 10p. Analysts have said that growing concern over the environment is one of the factors behind the increased interest in reusable period products. Many tampons and pads are often wrapped in plastic, and most discarded products end up in landfill. In 2017 the Marine Conservation Society also reported a large number of period products washed up on British beaches - including pads and single-use plastic applicators. As awareness of plastic pollution increases, plastic-free periods are being popularised on social media. Instagrammers and YouTubers are setting up channels to promote ""eco-friendly"" periods. It's also thought that women are turning to reusable products in order to save money. What is the tampon tax? The tampon tax refers to the revenue earned by a government when VAT (or sales tax) is applied to the sale of period products. Tampons and other period products are currently classed as luxury or non-essential items by the European Commission, so they can be taxed in the UK. Period poverty campaigners like Amika George and Freedom4Girls have claimed that children from low-income families have been unable to afford menstrual products, and have missed school as a result. Australian federal and state governments agreed this October to remove their levy after its introduction in 2000. India also recently scrapped its 12% tax on period products following campaigning by activists, while Canada did the same in 2015. The European Commission is currently reviewing changes to VAT rules which would allow governments to scrap the minimum 5% rate on period products. In the meantime, the UK government has pledged to invest the money raised by the tax in projects that benefit women and girls. Some supermarket chains have also been covering the 5% tax as a goodwill gesture for customers ahead of it being abolished in the UK. Period products in Ireland were already zero-rated before the EU legislation was introduced.

"Julian Dunkerton has also pledged to give more than £1m of Superdry shares to conservation charity, Blue Marine. Mr Dunkerton founded the business with Ian Hibbs in 1985 from a market stall in Cheltenham and opened its first store in Covent Garden in 2004. It now has more than 500 outlets in 46 countries. Superdry became a public company in 2010, listing its shares on the London Stock Exchange. 'Immensely proud' The business made Mr Dunkerton a multi-millionaire. He has sold two significant chunks of shares since then, realising £17.8m in January this year, and in 2016 he sold £50m in shares. Mr Dunkerton said: ""I am immensely proud of everything achieved at Superdry over the past 15 years. ""With other demands on my time, it is the right point for me to transition my focus and responsibilities."" Commenting on Mr Dunkerton's departure, Superdry chairman Peter Bamford said: ""Julian and I have been talking for some time about the right time for him to move on from the business. ""I would like to thank Julian for his outstanding contribution in building Superdry into such a great brand."" The Blue Marine Foundation says its aim is to combat overfishing and the destruction of biodiversity with the creation of large scale marine reserves.","One of the co-founders of sports fashion business Superdry is leaving the company, partly to spend more time on charity work."
"The ECB also unveiled a round of fresh stimulus, offering banks cheap loans to try to help revive the economy. The unexpected moves came as the bank made sharp cuts to its forecasts for both growth and inflation this year. The announcement sent the euro down by 0.6% against the dollar. Against the pound, it dropped by 0.1%. The central bank said rates would remain at their present levels ""at least through the end of 2019"" rather than its previous guidance of ""at least through the summer"". Mario Draghi, president of the ECB, said economic data showed a ""sizeable moderation"" in growth. He said economic growth in the euro area was now expected to be 1.1% this year, as against a previous forecast of 1.7%. Inflation is expected to be 1.2%, down from an earlier forecast of 1.6%. ""We are [in] a period of continued weakness and pervasive uncertainty. The near-term growth outlook will be weaker than previously anticipated,"" Mr Draghi said. The extent of the measures announced by the ECB underline its concerns over slowing growth in the eurozone. Its decision to push back on any plans to raise rates anytime soon follows similar moves from central banks around the world, including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Analysis Andrew Walker, World Service economics correspondent The European Central Bank is rolling out the economic artillery again. A marked slowdown in economic growth - confirmed today in official data as just 0.2% in the final quarter of 2018 - seems to have prompted the bank to take some action. Not the really big guns, at least at this stage. No cut in interest rates (they are so low already that that might not be realistic anyway) and no revival of quantitative easing. But the bank is using two tools that do suggest it is becoming more concerned. One is known as forward guidance, an indication of the likely path of interest rates in the future. They are currently rock bottom and the Bank now says said they are likely to stay that way until the end of the year. Previously the timescale was through the summer. This guidance is not a promise, but it does tell lenders and borrowers something about when rates most likely to be changed. The ECB has also announced plans for a new round of what are known as targeted long-term refinancing operations or TLTRO. If you are still conscious after reading that, these are loans made to commercial banks intended to stimulate more lending to households and business. They are also intended to - as the ECB statement puts it - ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Which means spreading the effect of the low interest rates throughout the eurozone economy. As well as a slowdown in the eurozone - Italy tipped into recession at the end of last year - Mr Draghi also pointed to the impact of trade wars and other factors. ""The risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are still tilted to the downside, on account of the persistence of uncertainties related to geopolitical factors, the threat of protectionism and vulnerabilities in the emerging markets,"" Mr Draghi said. The new lending facility for the banking sector will be known as Targeted Longer-Term Refinancing Operations. Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said the guidance on the next rate rise and the financing for banks was ""more accommodative than the markets had anticipated"". ""We doubt, however, that the new measures will be enough to reverse the economic slowdown,"" he said.","Interest rates in the eurozone will not rise until next year at the earliest, the European Central Bank has signalled amid evidence of a slowdown in the 19 countries using the single currency."
"By Joshua CheethamBusiness Reporter, BBC News YouGov said starting at 8am and finishing at 4pm was the most popular option, chosen by 25% of respondents. Another 13% said they would prefer to work 8.30am to 4.30pm, while 10% favoured 7am to 3pm. The polling firm said age and working location were the biggest factors in people's choices. Nearly one in five people aged 18 to 24 said they wanted to start work after 9am, compared with just 9% of those aged 54 to 65. More than a quarter of London workers also said they would like to start after 9am, compared with just 12% in the rest of South, and 13% in the North. YouGov said this may be due to a desire to avoid overcrowding on London's busy public transport system during traditional ""rush hours"". The polling firm, which surveyed 1,965 working adults, also said preferences did not appear to be related to being able pick up children from school. The results echo a survey of 3,000 UK adults, conducted by jobs website Timewise, which found 90% disliked the usual nine-to-five day. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) also reveals one in 10 Britons believe they are ""overemployed"", meaning that they work more hours than they want to.","Two thirds of British workers would prefer to start and end their working day earlier than the traditional 9am to 5pm, a new survey has found."
"Mark Carney met senior ministers on Thursday to discuss the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU. His worst-case scenario was that house prices could fall as much as 35% over three years, a source told the BBC. The warning echoes some of the Bank's previous comments. The Bank of England routinely carries out ""stress tests"" to check whether the banking system can withstand extreme financial shocks. Its latest one was conducted in November, when it said a 33% fall in house prices could occur in a worst-case scenario. Several reports said that the Bank governor also told the Downing Street meeting that mortgage rates could spiral, the pound could fall and inflation would rise, and countless homeowners could be left in negative equity. Speaking on Friday in Dublin, Mr Carney said the stress test was aimed at making sure the the largest UK banks could continue to meet the needs of the country through ""even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be"". ""Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst,"" he added. Mr Carney, who has just agreed to stay on as governor of the central bank until 2020, has faced strong criticism in the past, with Brexiteers accusing him of being part of the Remain camp. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test. It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year. The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen. Read more from Kamal here In August, Mr Carney told the BBC that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". That comment prompted leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg to call Mr Carney ""the high priest of Project Fear"", while former minister Iain Duncan Smith said ""there is no such thing as a no-deal"" and the Bank ""struggled to understand how this would work"". Independent property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Carney was ""not predicting Armageddon, he was not predicting house prices would fall by a third, they are just making sure that if, for some extraordinary reason anything was to go horribly wrong, the bank is prepared."" But he warned house prices were likely to fall in the first half of the 2019 as people put off buying amid the Brexit uncertainty, while the number of sellers, ""driven by death, debt and divorce"" would remain about the same. You may also be interested in: Following the Downing Street meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said ministers remained confident of a Brexit deal, but had agreed to ""ramp up"" their no-deal planning. ""As a responsible government, we need to plan for every eventuality. The Cabinet agreed that no-deal remains an unlikely but possible scenario in six months' time,"" the spokesman said. The Bank of England declined to comment. The cabinet meeting was part of a series of no-deal planning sessions designed to discuss the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place. After each meeting, planning papers are published on various subjects. Phones and driving On Thursday, the papers disclosed that UK car drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit. The government said that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers. The papers also warned that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run. And, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges. He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers.""",The Bank of England's governor has warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices and send another financial shock through the economy.
"By Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter, BBC News Digital Minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 live that if fans had to use a secondary site to buy tickets, ""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards to investigate. The ASA says Viagogo has been breaking UK advertising rules by failing to make additional fees clear. ""Viagogo continues to mislead consumers by not being upfront and clear about additional booking fees and delivery charges that are added at the end of the booking process,"" said the ASA. It has now handed the case over to National Trading Standards, which will undertake any necessary enforcement against Viagogo. ""We have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,"" said a trading standards spokesman. It has the power to prosecute firms for breaching ASA rulings, with penalties including fines or even closing offending firms. 'Drip pricing' Geneva-based Viagogo was one of four ticket brokers subject to ASA action in March. The advertising watchdog said Viagogo had agreed to make compulsory fees ""sufficiently clear"" by 26 May, but had failed to do so. The other three big resellers - StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn - were also subject to the action against ""drip pricing"", where VAT, booking and delivery fees were added at the end of the booking process. The ASA has received 23 complaints about Viagogo from groups including campaigners Fanfair Alliance, and concert promoters Festival Republic and Kilimanjaro Live. Kilimanjaro Live is promoting Ed Sheeran's upcoming UK stadium tour. Last week more than 10,000 tickets for that tour were cancelled, in an attempt to encourage fairer prices. Stuart Galbraith, of Kilimanjaro Live, said he negotiated with GetMeIn, Seatwave and StubHub to ensure they would not resell tickets for the tour. ""The only agency which listed against our wishes and ignored all our correspondence was Viagogo,"" he said. ""We're achieving exactly what Ed wanted, which is 'we want you to come in and pay this [fixed] price'."" Reg Walker of the consultancy Iridium pointed out that Viagogo was no longer based in Britain and ""seems to regard UK consumer protection legislation as a minor inconvenience"". ""It was also claiming to be an official site on Google paid advertisements and that again by the Advertising Standard Authority was deemed to be a breach of the code, so there is a long history here of Viagogo being non-compliant,"" he told 5 live. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority said Viagogo would face legal action after failing to make changes it had demanded. Its rivals StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave had agreed to provide better information about the tickets sold on their sites. They must warn if buyers risk being denied entry, the exact seats they will get and who was selling the tickets. However, the consumer watchdog said Viagogo had failed to give the same undertakings. Viagogo has not responded to a BBC request for comment. 'I feel scammed' Suzy Barnes, from Bristol, followed a Facebook ad to what looked like an official ticket site for the O2 to buy Pearl Jam tickets, spending about £1,000 for four seats. ""I received a notification from Viagogo to say I had bought tickets - the transaction was in Czech currency. I went to the O2 website and then discovered the tickets didn't even go on sale for another week. When they did they were £60 each,"" she says. ""Viagogo has not responded to my questions about how tickets could have been presented for sale before they had even been released.

"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC News RBS said it was taking a ""cautious approach"" to keeping staff safe, a move echoed by similar decisions at the likes of Facebook, Google and Fujitsu. The pandemic has forced a change in attitude among employers, said personnel expert Peter Cheese. He called it ""a moment of real change in the world of work"". And it is a change, added Mr Cheese, head of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), that puts staff more at the centre of operations. Originally, RBS had intended for its employees to work from home until the end of September, but it has now extended the period to early 2021. On 17 July, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said companies would have more discretion to bring staff back to workplaces if it is safe to do so, from 1 August onwards. A spokeswoman for RBS said: ""Like we've done throughout the pandemic the decision has been made carefully, including considering the latest guidance from the UK government on Friday and our own health and safety standards and procedures. ""It's a cautious approach but we feel the right one to take currently. We're in a fortunate position that so many of our colleagues can work from home and we feel it's the right decision to continue doing so into 2021."" Since the coronavirus lockdown began, about 10,000 RBS employees have continued to work in branches and some offices to support customers, while another 450 employees whose jobs cannot be done at home returned to offices and call centres in June. RBS says that it has been reconsidering how the bank works ""in the longer term"" and intends to tell staff about ""future ways of working"" later this year. According to Mr Cheese, the pandemic is ""forcing different thinking"" from employers about the viability of allowing employees to work flexibly. ""We're at a moment of real change in the world of work, driven by big existential crises. It's a big paradigm shift, putting people much more at the centre of thinking,"" he said. Not working, but shirking The CIPD, which represents HR professionals, says the UK has long lagged behind other nations in part-time work, due to a prevailing ""culture of presenteeism"", where bosses judge staff performance based on how many hours they spend in the office. There is also a long-standing stigma around working from home, but the CIPD says the coronavirus lockdown has been an eye-opener for businesses. A recent survey of 1,046 employers by the CIPD found that 28% believe the increase in homeworking during lockdown has increased productivity or efficiency. More than half of workforces have been working from home continuously since March, and employers expect the proportion of staff who work from home all the time to rise to 22% post-pandemic, compared with 9% previously. ""There's a longstanding belief that if you're working from home, you're shirking from home - you're doing other things that are not work,"" said Mr Cheese. ""Bosses are starting to shift towards judging output, rather than the number of hours spent in front of the computer."" He said the pandemic had forced bosses to care more about the physical and mental wellbeing of their staff. ""It's the biggest experiment we've ever had in homeworking. A lot of individuals quite like this - they have better work-life balance and they don't feel they're being scrutinised, and they don't have to commute,"" said Mr Cheese. Not everyone wants to work from home, whether it's because they live alone, or they have challenging personal circumstances, such as caring for young children or relatives. But the pandemic is making employers see staff as people, as opposed to ""tools"" of the business, he added. ""Understanding those aspects of their wider lives and their mental wellbeing - it's created a mindset shift of understanding how we can manage people better."" Flexible working Entrepreneurs, business strategists and HR experts have been discussing the anthropology of work and its social and economic impacts for at least a decade, and the notion of flexible working has kept coming up. Although the pandemic has accelerated thinking about how business processes could be changed to accommodate flexible working, the CIPD thinks it is unlikely that many firms will give up having physical office premises. Instead, the industry body thinks that office spaces will become places where some staff work, or they work in the office at different times and on different days, and that the office space will be used more for face-to-face meetings. ""In the end, businesses need to make money, but not at any cost,"" said Mr Cheese. ""What's driven a lot of this thinking is the concept that the only person who matters is the financial stakeholder, but now we're looking at multidisciplinary stakeholders - the business is responsible to their people, society and the environment.""","Royal Bank of Scotland's decision to allow 50,000 staff to work from home for the rest of 2020 underlines radical changes in the workplace, experts say."
"The group reported a pre-tax profit of £3m in the six months to 30 September, compared to a £5.4m loss for the half year to the end of December last year. Revenue from Skyfall as well as an upcoming Disney film made its film arm the star performer for the period. TV production revenues, however, fell sharply. The interim results are Pinewood's first since it changed its reporting period to the end of March from the end of December. Overall, film revenues for the half year to end of September were £18.8m, up 15% from £16.4m for the six months to the end of December 2011, compared to a 30% drop in TV production revenues to £2.5m from £3.6m. The company blamed the TV slump on ""tough ongoing market conditions"" and said that investment in upgrading its high-definition TV galleries had also forced it to turn away three large TV productions in favour of films. Chief executive Ivan Dunleavy added there was an ""encouraging"" number of film productions in the pipeline for next year, and said that in light of ""continuing and future demand for its facilities"" a £6.9m project to extend its studio facilities had received approval. Pinewood's results last year were hit by an exceptional £7.1m charge, after planning permission for its ambitious ""Project Pinewood"" plan to create a purpose-built film set with 1,400 permanent homes was turned down.","A series of blockbusters, including the latest James Bond movie, has helped UK film studios Pinewood Shepperton return to profit."
"The announcement came ahead of a law being unveiled this afternoon, which bans the Chinese firm from the network. Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said he was pushing for the ""complete removal of high-risk vendors"" from 5G networks. The new deadline falls earlier than expected, although maintaining old equipment will still be allowed. Networks will now have to adjust their schedules for deployment of the reserves of Huawei 5G kit they have built up. Previously, BT's EE division, Vodafone and Three UK would have had until 2027 to install any such equipment acquired before the end of this year - when a purchase ban comes into effect. Huawei told the BBC it would not be commenting on the announcement. Big fines Attempts to rid Huawei from the network have been ongoing for more than a year. But the new Telecommunications Security Bill is the first step in enshrining such bans in law, and offers details of exactly how it will work - if it is passed by Parliament. MPs will debate the bill at second reading in the Commons at about 15:30GMT. It will give government national security powers, allowing them to give instructions to big telecoms companies, such as BT, about how they use so-called ""high-risk"" vendors like Huawei, if at all. It also threatens telecoms firms with hefty fines if they fail to comply with the new, higher security standards. They could total 10% of turnover or more than £100,000 per day. Mr Dowden said that the ""new and unprecedented powers"" would allow government to ""identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security"". ""We are also publishing a new strategy to make sure we are never again dependent on a handful of telecoms vendors for the smooth and secure running of our networks,"" he said. The ban on installations will be accompanied by measures to encourage more suppliers to enter the market and replace Huawei, and the development of new technologies that open up the market. There were fears firms might stockpile new kit and install it later, despite a ban on buying it from the end of 2020. Under the new strategy, the government will spend an initial £250m which will involve setting up a National Telecoms Lab research facility as well as investing in open radio technology. ""Our plans will spark a wave of innovation in the design of our future mobile networks,"" Mr Dowden added. Political wrangling It follows months of political wrangling, both in the UK and internationally, over Huawei's threat to security and its alleged links to the Chinese state. In July, the government ordered the complete removal of the company's kit from the entire 5G network by 2027, amid pressure from the US. The UK had initially decided that Huawei equipment should be removed from the sensitive part of the ""core"" network, and only make up a maximum of 35% of the non-core systems. The deadline was set to be 2023. Huawei, however, has dismissed concerns from both the US and its allies over its operations. Its vice-president Victor Zhang has previously said that the decision to remove the firm from the UK's 5G network was ""politically motivated and not based on a fair evaluation of the risks"".","Telecoms providers must stop installing Huawei equipment in the UK's 5G mobile network from September, the government has said."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter I have spent the last few weeks speaking to many people who are closely involved in Tesco - or were. I have also spoken to analysts and commentators to build as rounded a picture as possible of a retail business that has lost 50% of its market value in a year. I'll just repeat that. Has lost 50% of its market value in a year. Now, a share price that drops by 50% may not mean very much to the shopper in the street. Until he or she realises that Tesco's profits and dividends - slashed by the retailer - make a vital contribution to all of our pension funds. The business is also one of Britain's largest corporate tax payers. If too many major British businesses fail, then that not only means bad news for UK Plc and, in this case, the supply of groceries - it also means bad news for our savings and the government's tax income. Tomorrow, Tesco will reveal its latest results. Sales and profits are likely to be down again. Grim enough. But these are also the restating of the results Tesco was meant to release last month - until it stumbled across a £250m accounting problem in its profit forecasts. I'll just repeat that. A £250m accounting problem in its profit forecasts. It doesn't just rain for Tesco. It pours, then it hails, then there's a bit of sleet and snow thrown in. For a business that was predicting it would make £1.1bn profits for the first half of this year, a mis-statement of £250m is a significant number. So significant that a series of former executives from the business I have spoken to simply don't believe it. They say it is likely that Tesco will announce a lower figure tomorrow. That is just a wrinkle. If you cannot trust a business's accounts, then there is not much left to trust. Tesco insists that the numbers it reveals tomorrow will be accurate. It will also attempt to explain what went so horribly wrong. That will come as a relief to investors who have told me they are astonished that there has been such a Horlicks at Tesco. They are voting with their wallets. Since the announcement that Tesco could have been booking profits from suppliers before costs - flattering Tesco's bottom line - the retailer's share price has fallen by 10%. Warren Buffett is the highest-profile seller, saying his 4.1% investment stake in Tesco was a ""huge mistake"" which has cost him £465m in a year. This is a man who runs an investment fund - Berkshire Hathaway - so successful and popular it costs £200,000 to buy one top-graded share. Tesco has announced its own inquiry into the accounting crisis, led by Deloitte and Freshfields. The Financial Conduct Authority has also started an official investigation. The Financial Reporting Council and the Serious Fraud Office are also maintaining a ""watching brief"". Eight senior executives have been asked to ""step aside"" while the inquiry continues, though no blame has been attached to any of them. This is one of the biggest corporate messes of the year. How Tesco responds ahead of the key ""golden quarter"" for all retailers - Christmas - will be key. 'Find me £30m' The first Dave Lewis, Tesco's new chief executive, and Sir Richard Broadbent, the chairman, knew about the problem in Tesco's accounts was on Friday, 19 September. Mr Lewis and Sir Richard were given a file by Tesco's general counsel, Adrian Morris. He had been handed it by a lawyer - who had been given it by a senior member of the finance team. Such a convoluted process - using a company's legal department to raise concerns rather than going direct to executives or the board - is thought by some to reveal a business where trust is not much evident. The file highlighted worrying discrepancies between when profits were accounted for from deals with suppliers and when costs were paid. I am told by one senior figure very close to Tesco that the ""whistle blower"" had become concerned that the numbers he was being sent on supplier income did not have the ""full documentation that I needed"". Was someone trying to cover something up? At its simplest it appears that profits were ""booked"" early - ie moved into the first half of the year. At the same time, expenditure on costs associated with the deals was delayed. Now, this can be done in any number of ways, some of which may have been used by Tesco. Suppliers pay retailers for promotions that could mean more of their product being sold. Payments can be made for better positions on shelves, for visibility on ""plinths"" at the end of aisles where customers are more likely to see products, or for two-for-one offers. One senior figure in the grocery industry said there was evidence across the sector that payments are sometimes taken unilaterally from suppliers. The payments may be disputed later, and a refund or new agreement made later in the second half of the year. By then, the original payment has been taken as revenue. Targets, therefore, have notionally been hit. In an era of rising sales and increasing amounts of money going through the tills, moving profits forward can later easily be disguised, cloaked by increasing revenues in the second half of the year. Any issues in the first six months are ""traded away"". But when sales are falling - as they have been for a number of quarters at Tesco - then moving profits forward starts to cause problems. ""When the business is under strain, you will get found out,"" one Tesco source told me. It was reported over the weekend that wrongdoing by a small number of employees had been found by Tesco's internal inquiries. The details of such behaviour may seem remarkable to the outside world. But speaking to former senior employees at Tesco, that ignores the febrile and aggressive attitude within retailing, which is a highly competitive market. The arrival of the discounters Aldi and Lidl - which have both eaten into Tesco's market share (down from 30.2% to 28.8% according to Kantar Worldpanel data) - only exacerbated the push for the earlier taking of revenues and profits. One former senior Tesco executive who was head of a large number of supply chains told me that as the end of each half year approached, heads of division would put out a call. ""'Find me £30m' would be the message,"" the former executive told me. ""That would cascade down to the buyers and they would demand more and more from suppliers."" It seems that, as Tesco's trading position deteriorated, actions became more and more desperate. Bruno Monteyne, senior research analyst at Sanford Bernstein and himself someone who used to work at Tesco, puts it like this: ""As a retailer you always have long-term relationships with suppliers - and in any long-term relationship you have give and take, much like a marriage. ""Clearly while everything was going well, suppliers wanted to work with Tesco and Tesco asked for things back. ""But because Tesco has been under three or four years of substantial profits pressure it has been pulling the bed cover over to its side a bit more - and it got more and more unbalanced."" The new CEO Dave Lewis has written to suppliers saying that ""integrity"" has to be at the heart of everything the business does. Part of this is about culture change. ""I expect Tesco to act with integrity and transparency at all times,"" Mr Lewis said in the letter to thousands of the businesses' suppliers. ""Our values are what we stand for and we will live those values in all that we do for Tesco. It is in times of challenge that our values are tested, and I want to reassure you that we will live our values fully at this challenging time. ""Our relationships with our suppliers are critical. They form the bedrock of the service we provide to our customers."" Pledges on ""integrity"" are one thing. Sorting out a £250m accounting mis-statement is quite another. One central question is whether there was evidence of any major accounting problems before this year. On that, as with so many issues connected to Tesco, accounts differ. Senior figures close to the business told me there was no evidence earlier in the year of any problems. In 2013, Tesco actually tripled the number of checks it did on supplier accounts, a move I understand satisfied the company's auditors PwC ahead of their audit of that year's accounts. The issue of commercial income - that's payment to suppliers - had been raised by PwC. ""The committee notes that commercial income was an area of focus for the external auditors based on their assessment of gross risks,"" the annual report says, referring to Tesco's audit committee. Ken Hanna, the chairman of that committee, was satisfied the risks had been dealt with by the extra checks. One source said the business was under more pressure because of declining sales, but it was seen as a time for more vigilance, not less. ""What's worse than a profit warning?"" my source said. ""Well, going to prison for fraud."" At present Deloitte and Freshfields are focusing on this financial year. But many would find it remarkable if the inquiries do not uncover more widespread problems. If the accounting problems hit Tesco's international businesses, then all sorts of horrors could come to light. One major investor in Tesco pointed me towards an analyst note from 2010 which talked of ""aggressive accounting"" at the retailer. You can read my original blog on that here. Tesco sources say the issues raised by the note were not concerned with commercial income and were of a far lower magnitude than the problems of this year. They suggest that the 2014 accounting problem is unique. 'Where's the chairman?' The role of chairman Sir Richard Broadbent during Tesco's travails has faced criticism from some investors. There was a point during the middle of year when Tesco had neither a chief executive nor a chief financial officer. A little careless, many said, to say the least. It also raised significant questions about how the board approached succession planning. The board has faced further criticism for a lack of retail experience. On that, there have been some improvements, as I've written about here. Sir Richard also appeared to be unsighted as to whether Laurie McIlwee, the former chief financial officer, was actually working for Tesco when the accounting problems came to light. He wasn't - Mr McIlwee left the business in early April. Tesco was obliged to publish a clarification on that matter. Possible evidence that the accounting problems are limited to this summer could include the fact that Mr McIlwee has not been called by those undertaking the inquiries, despite making himself available. Many investors believe Sir Richard will leave as chairman once the initial investigations have been completed. Some would like to see a big retail hitter like Archie Norman, the chairman of ITV and the former chief executive of Asda, take over. Mr Norman, as far as I am aware, has not yet been contacted. Presumably the conversation would be something like: ""Hi, Archie, now about this poisoned chalice..."" A juggernaut with the wheels coming off At the heart of all this is, of course, the fact that customers appear to have fallen out of love with Tesco. This was the store that under Sir Terry Leahy, the chief executive before Philip Clarke, became the largest retailer in the UK. It also expanded across the globe. The problem was that its slogan Every Little Helps morphed, according to many critics, into Every Little Helps Tesco. One of the funniest-ever Matt cartoons in The Telegraph pictures an elderly couple sitting on the sofa with a Tesco Express, complete with special offers, sitting proudly in the corner of the sitting room. Tescopoly was a new game we could all play as the retailer's lorries thundered around the country and its shops opened on every High Street. The customers flooded in and the profits went up and up. The share price flirted with £5 in the autumn of 2007. It is now languishing around £1.80. When did it start going wrong? When he took over, Mr Clarke said that Tesco had been ""running too hot"" under Sir Terry, suggesting that the retailer had lost focus on the core retailing principles - best prices, highest quality and stores that people like shopping in. Mr Clarke famously pulled Tesco out of ""the space race"", halting the expansion of hyper-stores and instead focusing on a different strategy of making Tesco ""all things to all people"" with a strong digital bent. The new Amazon, he explained privately. Though, of course, as one source told me, Amazon did not make profits like Tesco made profits. Under Mr Clarke, Tesco bought posh coffee shops, restaurants and digital businesses as it expanded the services it thought customers would be interested in. The launch of Tesco's own tablet, the Hudl, proved very successful - giving Tesco an automatic way of influencing how people shopped online. There were many who disagreed with Mr Clarke's approach. Allies of Sir Terry say that Mr Clarke allowed Tesco to lose its reputation as the cheapest of the ""Big Four"" retailers, a crown it lost to Asda. Customers followed with their feet, deserting for competitors. When it came to tackling the exodus, sources say there was a major split among the executives over Tesco's strategy. Some wanted the retailer to open more discount-style stores under the ""One Stop"" brand. I am told Mr Clarke disagreed, saying that a store refreshment programme was delivering results. Critics are not convinced. Rewards for being a Club Card holder were cut back (a mistake, according to one source, given the cards' popularity with customers) and an exodus of senior staff including Mr McIlwee, Richard Brasher, head of the UK business, Tim Mason, head of the US, and Andrew Higginson, another former chief financial officer, left the retailer struggling internally. One figure close to what might be regarded as the ""old Leahy team"", told me: ""To be honest I feel most sorry for the staff who work in the stores and operations who deserved better from their board, both executive and non-executive. ""At its core the UK business is a great company and despite a huge drain of talent, when Tesco focuses on the customer and regains its determination to do the right things it has the potential to rebound."" That rebound, if it comes, is likely to be lengthy and expensive. David McCarthy, a leading retail analyst with HSBC, said a turnaround could cost as much £3bn. ""Terry built a fantastic business in Tesco, there is no question about that and there was a relentless focus on the consumer,"" Mr McCarthy told the BBC. ""But five, six, seven years ago the focus seemed to shift more towards a mantra of Tesco does not miss its numbers and in that mantra, the consumer does not feature."" The consumer needs to feature now. Most believe Tesco will cut prices again and look to improve its widely criticised stores. Recent marketing campaigns, including a voucher for £5 off a £40 shop, appear to have arrested the sales decline to an extent. The four-week figures for retail sales from Kantar - privately shared with the retailers and seen by the BBC - show that Tesco sales are down 1.5% year-on-year over the last month, compared to Sainsbury's (down 4%) and Morrisons (down 4.6%). Of course, short term figures are heavily skewed by marketing pushes. The Kantar 12-week comparison released yesterday revealed Tesco's sales down over 3% in the last three months compared to last year. Many believe that Tesco should move away from vouchers and one-off price promotions and win back customers with lower prices across all its ranges. The accounting problems may be dreadful. But the real test for Mr Lewis will be getting customers back through the door. Remember, there are only 63 shopping days to Christmas.","Apologies, but this is going to be a longer blog.

"BSkyB said pre-tax profit was £288m in the three months to September, compared with £307m last year. But revenue rose to £1.72bn, up from £1.65bn a year earlier, with the firm adding 48,000 customers in the quarter. James Murdoch was reappointed as a non-executive director at BSkyB's annual general meeting on Thursday. Formula One Announcing the results, chief executive Jeremy Darroch said: ""We have made a strong start to the year, delivering another good quarterly performance and continuing to position the business for the long term."" Despite the first price rise in two years kicking in and competition from rivals such as Virgin Media and the YouView catch-up service, Sky TV remained popular. ""Despite market fears over new competition, TV adds (customer additions) continued to grow with 20,000 net adds,"" Morgan Stanley said in a note to clients. ""This puts into perspective recent concerns that Sky might suffer a fall."" Retail subscription revenue grew by 4% to £1.4bn, helped by the launch of a dedicated Formula One channel. Tennis had a record audience of 4.5 million viewers on the back of Andy Murray's US Open victory. The number of new households is no longer close to the 100,000-plus pay-TV subscribers it used to sign up per quarter, but the group said that average customer spend had increased as cable subscribers added new services. Shares in BSkyB closed 7% higher at 759 pence in London. 'Highest integrity' At BSkyB's AGM, James Murdoch was re-appointed to his director role with only about 5% of voting shareholders refusing to back him. Mr Murdoch is a non-executive director at the company. He resigned as chairman of BSkyB in April following the phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World newspaper. BSkyB chairman Nicholas Ferguson defended Mr Murdoch and his position on the board, saying he had shown the ""highest level of competence and integrity"". In September, Ofcom criticised him for his role in the phone hacking scandal. The regulator said: ""We consider James Murdoch's conduct, including his failure to initiate action on his own account on a number of occasions, to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged."" However, Ofcom's inquiry concluded that BSkyB was a ""fit and proper"" company to hold a broadcasting licence. James's father, Rupert Murdoch, is the mogul behind the media empire News Corp, which owns 39% of BSkyB. Public outrage over the phone hacking scandal last year forced News Corp to drop its $12bn (£7.7bn) bid to buy the 61% of BSkyB it did not already own.","Pay TV group BSkyB said that more customers took on additional services such as broadband and phonelines in the last quarter, boosting its revenue."
"The comments, in which he asked why he should mourn for Mr Floyd, had prompted athletes, gyms and sportswear firms to cut ties with the business. Incoming owner Eric Roza, a tech executive and co-founder of a successful CrossFit gym, said he would be ""working hard to rebuild bridges"". Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The value of the Crossfit business, which is based on a branded exercise regimen focused on high intensity workouts, has previously been estimated at about $4bn (£3.1bn). It is affiliated with about 13,000 gyms in 158 countries worldwide. ""In the past weeks, divisive statements and allegations have left many members of our community struggling to reconcile our transformative experiences in the local box with what we've been reading online,"" said Mr Roza, a former Oracle executive who is now working for US venture capitalists General Catalyst. ""My view is simple: Racism and sexism are abhorrent and will not be tolerated in CrossFit."" In early June, Mr Glassman had courted controversy by responding to a public health body on Twitter that was saying racism was a public health issue. Mr Glassman tweeted: ""It's FLOYD-19"", an apparent reference to the coronavirus. He followed it up with a second tweet saying: ""Your failed model quarantined us and now you're going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd's brutal murder sparked riots nationally."" He also called an affiliate ""delusional"" for questioning why CrossFit had been silent on the killing in Minneapolis. Hours before posting the fateful tweets, Mr Glassman had told gym owners on a private Zoom call that was leaked to reporters: ""We're not mourning for George Floyd - I don't think me or any of my staff are. ""Can you tell me why I should mourn for him? Other than that it's the white thing to do."" What happened to CrossFit? The comments prompted affiliate gyms to drop CrossFit branding and were rebuked by athletes, as well as Adidas-owned Reebok, which said it was ending its partnership with the brand. The backlash set off further reports that alleged incidents of sexism at the firm. In a statement this month announcing his retirement, Mr Glassman acknowledged that he had ""created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members"". He added: ""I cannot let my behaviour stand in the way of HQ's or affiliates' missions. They are too important to jeopardise."" On Wednesday, in its announcement of the new owner, CrossFit shared a statement from Mr Glassman, which said it was ""time"" for him to move on. ""The world has changed but the magnificent human machine, the proven benefits of CrossFit, and its market opportunity remain unchanged,"" he said. Mr Glassman's retirement was the latest corporate fallout from the protests set off by George Floyd's death in the hands of police, which have reignited discussions of racism and prompted many firms to speak out.

"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News But the biennial Farnborough Airshow - it alternates with the Paris Airshow - may not be the blockbuster festival of orders of previous years. With about 1,500 exhibitors and some 100,000 trade visitors, Farnborough's pulling power remains huge. However, the event is very unlikely to see a repeat of the record $204bn (£157bn) haul of aircraft and engine orders announced at the 2014 show. Boeing and Airbus will as usual compete for headlines, so it's a fair bet that both planemakers will have stored up deals to unveil at the show. Nevertheless, Phil Seymour, president of the consultancy International Bureau of Aviation, predicts a ""quiet Farnborough"" for contracts. ""A slowdown in orders is likely with operators moderating growth, delaying or cancelling orders and manufacturers facing production challenges,"" he says. ""There is concern amongst investors that some airlines have been expanding their fleets too fast."" Airlines in Asia and the Middle East, especially Emirates Airline, Qatar Airways and emerging budget carriers, have fuelled much of the order growth over the past decade. But many airlines are pausing for breath while they absorb existing contracts. Also, the production lines of Airbus and Boeing are booked for years ahead. A report published last week by Alix Partners, a global advisory firm, estimates that these two manufacturers have a 13,400 order backlog. Eric Bernardini, head of the aerospace and defence (A&D) division at Alix, says the oil price collapse and strengthening dollar - the industry trades in dollars - have ""provided tailwinds for the global A&D sector"". ""However, strong airline demand, especially for narrow-body aircraft, is putting historical pressure on the commercial aircraft manufacturers who are now trying to work through record backlogs."" Post-referendum politics may not help, either. It was thought that the UK government might use Farnborough to put the finishing touches to some big defence contracts, including possible deals to buy maritime patrol jets and attack helicopters. But sterling's plunge against the dollar, compounded by the current political uncertainty, may mean that bean counters at the Ministry of Defence re-run their slide rules over these contracts. Economic value UK aerospace: UK defence: Source: ADS Group, the industry trade body On the defence side, the big noise - literally and symbolically - at Farnborough will be displays by the F-35B Lightning II jet, which will be the mainstay of America's combat fleet and is being bought by the UK for use with the RAF and on the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers. One of the world's most expensive warplanes, it's also known as the Joint Strike Fighter. The F-35 has been plagued by technical problems and cost over-runs; the estimated final budget of the project is now reportedly between $400-540bn. The Lockheed Martin-built F-35 was due to fly at Farnborough two years ago, but that appearance was cancelled after the entire fleet was grounded when an engine caught fire during a training exercise in the US. Lockheed and the US government are desperate to convince the world that the F-35 is back on track, and Farnborough will see a bigger presence than usual from Pentagon top brass and US officials to bolster support for the programme. It will also be a big show for Boeing. The US giant celebrates its 100th anniversary on 15 July and is planning to showcase its past, present and future. For those who love nostalgia, a B-17 Flying Fortress, B-25 Mitchell, DC3 Dakota and a P-51 Mustang will be flying as part of a huge Boeing heritage festival. And for a glimpse of the future, Boeing's new 737 Max, a revamped version of its best-selling aircraft and due to be delivered to the first customer next year, will make its air show debut. Not to be outdone, Airbus will pitch to the same sector with its A320neo as the European planemaker battles with its rival for dominance in the market for the next generation of narrow-body aircraft. Airbus's big beast, the A380 super-jumbo, will also be flying, with the company trying to convince potential buyers that a viable market still remains for such a huge aircraft. The A380 is in a sales slump, and Airbus is weighing up interest from airlines for a revamped version. Outside the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, there will be plenty of products on sale from the next tier of planemakers. Brazil's Embraer continues to make in-roads into new markets and will have aircraft from across it three business units on show. And Canada's Bombardier will show its C-Series aircraft, a programme whose ballooning costs and technical problems took the company to the edge of disaster. Yet, after years of scepticism about the C-Series' viability - in a few days the aircraft makes its regular commercial debut with airline Swiss and later this year with Air Baltic. Bombardier and Embraer and others are trying to chip away at the Boeing-Airbus duopoly. Despite a slowdown in orders from some traditional big buyers of aircraft, the market generally remains strong. Mr Seymour, of the International Bureau of Aviation, says India is growing fast. Iran, whose airlines and airport infrastructure, need upgrading after years of sanctions, is also potentially a strong market. And, he says: ""China's aviation market is still looking bright."" Indeed, China has its biggest ever presence at Farnborough, underlining the country's aerospace ambitious growth strategy and ambitions to challenge Boeing and Airbus. Chinese firms have doubled the amount of space taken on 2014, according to the Farnborough show's organisers. Chinese firms exhibiting include state-owned aircraft manufacturer Comac, which last year unveiled its C919 passenger jet, marking a major step into the market for large airliners since a failed attempt in the 1980s. In addition to building its own aerospace manufacturing industry, China has expansion plans that include building another 300 airports by 2020, more than doubling the current number in the country. This investment is to satisfy the huge growth of Chinese airlines over the next couple of decades. However, one country that won't be at Farnborough in any official capacity is Russia, after years of deteriorating relations and visa embargoes. Although individual Russian companies plan new product launches. Sukhoi, for example, is displaying an intriguing new luxury jet aimed a sports teams. The plane is kitted out with diagnostic seats and all sorts tech to assess players and athletes in the air. But, according to the Tass news agency last month, Russia's industry and trade minister, Denis Manturov, Farnborough is not what it used to be. ""As for Farnborough, our participation will be rather formal. I should say in recent years our manufacturers have lost great interest in that event. But to some extent Russian companies will take part in the show to remind them that we exist,"" the minister told Tass. It's a reminder that although the Farnborough Airshow is a mammoth marketing event, the aerospace and defence industry will always be bound up with geo-politics.",The world's aerospace and defence industry descends on a small town about 30 miles west of London this week for what is the biggest event in the industry's calendar.
"By Laurel IvesTechnology of Business reporter The struggle to prise them away from a life spent online is a familiar one for many beleaguered parents. Our youngsters spend hours on Instagram chasing ""likes"" - and often coming up against cyber-bullying - or playing games, obsessing about YouTube influencers or surfing between different ""friendship groups"" on WhatsApp. So how can we keep them safe from harmful content? Content filtering software has been around for many years, but parents have often been too tech-shy to work it properly. And it often required children to hand over their passwords - a potential cause of family rows. But now a new generation of digital parental controls has arrived on the market, promising to help parents take back control more easily. Circle with Disney, Koala Safe and Ikydz, for example, are systems that claim to be able to control every digital device in your home with a few taps on a smartphone app. The new products work by connecting to your existing household wi-fi router. In the case of Circle you plug in the white cube - clearly inspired by the Apple school of design - and it immediately lists every connected phone, laptop, tablet, and so on in your home, and offers a variety of ways to control them. It can be tricky to work out who owns which device. Initially I block my husband's phone by mistake - to howls of outrage. But once I identify each device's MAC address - a set of numbers and letters unique to each product - it is relatively easy to assign each gadget to a specific user. Then you can set filters based on age - pre-school, kid, teen, adult or none - which block explicit content, gambling, dating and more, according to the filter selected. You can also block specific apps or websites - Fortnite and Instagram anyone? And you can put time limits on usage, pause the internet, and set bed times. But you could do most of this with traditional filtering software, and these days internet service providers, cyber-security software firms and web browsers are all much better at offering family settings on their services. What's more, the same issues arise. My two daughters, aged 11 and 13, loudly protest about ""violations of privacy"" when they realised I could see every site and app they've visited. Once I've reassured them that this is not about snooping, but more about limitation and safety, they grudgingly seem to accept the new controls. Indeed, a 2018 survey of young people between the ages of 11 and 16 by Internet Matters, an online safety not-for-profit organisation, showed that 65% were in favour of parental controls. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, thinks it is good parenting to set limits. ""The internet can be a great resource, but it can also be the wild west for children. We wouldn't think it was OK to drop our children off in the park at night if they were younger,"" she says. ""In the same way we shouldn't think it is OK for them to roam the internet without any guidance or restrictions."" There are disadvantages with these latest filtering devices, though. Some don't work once your child's phone leaves the home and is no longer on home wi-fi. And they won't all work if the wi-fi is switched off and the internet is accessed via mobile data. Other products are also incompatible with some UK routers. So what other options are there? More Technology of Business ""For younger children a Monqi phone [Monqi make phones designed specifically for kids] might be a better option as a first device,"" advises Ghislaine Bombusa, head of digital at Internet Matters. ""Or if you're worried about particular websites you can set safe search on your family's broadband; that may be sufficient and is free. You can also set up Google Safe Search or restricted mode on YouTube."" Another option is buying one of the new generation of high-speed routers, some of which not only deliver good coverage but also have parental control options pre-installed. And for parents with more tech expertise, Kate Bevan, editor of Which? Computing, recommends setting up Open DNS up on your router, which enables parents to put controls in place. The basic blocking options are free. But Ben Halpert, who set up the US based Savvy Cyber Kids, warns that there are limits to what technology alone can achieve. ""Once children reach a certain age, their peers will tell them, or they will stumble upon ways to get around parental controls,"" he says. ""No matter what technology you put in place, it will never prevent your child from being exposed to things you wish they did not experience. This is why building trust with your children and continuing to talk about technology use is so important."" Most experts stress that discussion, education and negotiation are just as important as technical fixes when it comes to keeping your kids safe online. Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook","As concerns grow about the effect of harmful social media content on our children, we look at what tools are available for parents to regulate what kids see and how long they spend online."
"Diageo is reported to be trying to buy a 15% stake from Vijay Mallya, the man behind the Force India Formula One team and Kingfisher Airline, and 10% from other shareholders. Mr Mallya, chairman of United Spirits, has been under pressure to raise capital to put into his airline. United Spirits and Diageo held unsuccessful talks in 2009. In a short statement to the London Stock Exchange, they warned that there was no certainty that a deal would be reached this time either. Shares in United Spirits have more than doubled in 2012 and rose by 2.4% on Tuesday. Diageo shares also rose on the news. There has long been speculation that Mr Mallya would sell part of his stake in either United Spirits or United Breweries, which makes Kingfisher beer, to raise money for his airline. United Spirits owns the Whyte & Mackay Scotch Whisky brand, which it bought for £595m in 2007. Buying a stake in United Spirits would boost Diageo's Scotch whisky holdings, as well as giving it a stake in India's lucrative spirits market.",Drinks company Diageo has announced it is in talks about buying a stake in India's United Spirits.
"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter The freelance journalist was one of 1.9 million hit by the computer meltdown which followed the bank's upgrading of its computer systems on 20 April. Once she was able to view her account, she discovered a £898 payment to her was missing. She's still waiting for her cash and is one of tens of thousands of TSB customers with unresolved issues. TSB said the situation hadn't changed since chairman Richard Meddings statement last week. He said then that the bank was ""now functioning at, or close to, normal for the majority of TSB customers"". ""We recognise that we still have areas where we need to improve performance for our customers and we do not underestimate these remaining issues,"" he said at the time. Ms Hurst says she's now considering switching accounts. ""My problem could have been unrelated to the IT crisis, but I have no confidence in TSB and really worry about what's going on with my money, and get no help when I have a problem,"" Sarah said. TSB's Twitter staff said they couldn't help and she would have to go to her local branch, which raised an old wound she had with the bank. ""I opened the account at a Lloyds in my village five years ago because it was my local branch. But first it became a TSB and then it was closed down."" Compensation for the chaos Ms Hurst is far alone from being fed up with TSB. More than 95,000 people have so far complained and the majority - if their complaints are justified - are in line for compensation. Also getting their money back will be the 1,300 people who were hit by fraudsters in the wake of the the meltdown. The bank has already admitted that attempts to compromise customers' accounts grew from six to seven cases a day to more than 200 a day at the peak of the fraud attack at the beginning of May. Meanwhile TSB has also promised to compensate the 370 customers who were wrongly registered as dead by the bank after they tried to switch accounts. What happens next? TSB has recruited an extra 1,500 staff to help resolve issues, while another 500 workers have been moved into areas to offer greater help to customers. The bank is unable to say when all the issues will be resolved but is keen to reiterate that for the vast majority of customers normal banking service has been resumed. Chief executive Paul Pester, who has faced calls for his resignation, said last week: ""We remain focused on doing whatever it takes to put things right."" The bank has commissioned an independent review from lawyers Slaughter & May which is expected to detail what went wrong and what lessons need to be learned. The financial regulators have been undertaking their own investigations alongside that. Paul Pester said: ""We are making progress in understanding the root cause of the problems."" But he will be understandably nervous about his future when the reports are published - although that date is likely to be some weeks away. What caused the problems? When TSB split from the Lloyds Banking Group, it continued to use its computer system while a new one was developed. When it was ready, TSB moved customers' data from the Lloyds platform to its own. This was a long-planned disruption to the service. The bank said it informed customers of the change, and that it would lead to them being unable to use online banking or payment systems that weekend. That led to two problems. First, many customers said they were unaware of the changes and so were caught out. Second, customers experienced difficulties long after the deadline that TSB had promised things would be fixed.

"Heineken had raised its bid, from 50, to 53 Singapore dollars per share. On Saturday, Singapore-based Fraser and Neave confirmed it had accepted an improved offer from the Dutch brewer for its 40% stake in Asia Pacific Investment Pte Ltd (APIPL). Fraser and Neave shareholders still need to approve the deal in a vote. APIPL is a joint venture between Heineken and Fraser and Neave which operates Asia Pacific Breweries (APB). As well as Tiger, APB brews a range of other well-known Asian brands such as Anchor beer, Baron's Strong Brew, ABC Extra Stout, Archipelago beer and Bintang beer. Heineken's chief executive, Jean-François van Boxmeer, said in a statement: ""Our Asian headquarters will continue to be based in Singapore, and we remain 100% committed to the growth and success of APB and the Tiger brand."" If approved, the deal would give Heineken an 81.6% stake in APB triggering an automatic takeover offer for the outstanding shares in the company which would cost a further 2.5bn Singapore dollars. 'Alternative offer' As part of the deal, Fraser and Neave has promised not to ""solicit, engage in discussions or accept any alternative offer or proposal"" for its interests in APB. This clause refers to a rival bid from the family of Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi who had made a 55 Singapore dollar per share offer for a smaller stake in APB. Mr Charoen controls Thai Beverage (ThaiBev) South East Asia's second biggest brewer behind San Miguel of the Philippines. ThaiBev is also Fraser and Neave's biggest shareholder with a 26.4% stake making it a major power broker in the coming shareholder vote.","Heineken has agreed to buy Fraser and Neave's controlling stake in the maker of Tiger beer in a deal worth 5.6bn Singapore dollars (US$4.5bn, £2.8bn)."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter More than 130 owners have reported overheating problems behind the glove-box area, some of which have resulted in fires. Vauxhall is investigating the problem, but has not yet issued a full recall. The affected model is the Zafira B. It is thought that 280,000 of them are currently on the road in the UK. The alarm was raised by three different women, who say their cars burst into flames. Among them was Sue Freemantle, from Devon, who had four children in her Zafira when a fire began behind the dashboard. Claire Wheatley also from Devon, had to evacuate her car along with her husband when a similar incident occurred. They and others have posted pictures of the fires on Facebook. Air conditioning Vauxhall has already examined 20 such cars which have been burned out, and has summoned engineers from Germany to investigate. In a statement, it said it thought the heating and ventilation system was to blame. It said previous repairs may have been carried out improperly, or in some cases, non-genuine parts may have caused the fires. The affected models have manual air-conditioning, as pictured above. Owners who have electronic climate control have not reported any problems. The cars, all right-hand drive, were built between 2005 and 2014. Anyone who has concerns about their vehicle is being asked to contact their dealer.","Carmaker Vauxhall is trying to contact hundreds of thousands of British drivers, over worries their Zafira models could catch fire."
"By Justin BonesBBC Radio 5 Live Wake Up To Money Its former UK boss, Ronny Gottschlich, says that in the early years the discounters were really small players. ""If anything it was considered to be a poor man's shop. The German discount model would sit in the corner and people thought you couldn't do your weekly shopping in there."" But things began to change around the time of the financial crisis in 2009. ""People were looking at how they could save money but it wasn't the only reason more people shopped there. We made it more attractive for the British shopper, rather than taking the German model and copying it like for like."" Lidl now has more than 700 stores in the UK and is opening a new one on average every week. It plans to invest £1.45bn in the next two years. German Mr Gottschlich ran the British arm of the company between 2010 and 2016 before leaving to set up his own consultancy. He told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money that one of his key targets was the introduction of more British products. ""In 2010 only about 35% was sourced in Britain. By 2016 it was about 65%."" There was, however, a challenge to balance range with over-stocking. ""The British customer is used to much more choice. But by having fewer lines you save a lot of money. You're able to negotiate on a much more reduced range; transport costs are cheaper and your staff are more productive meaning you don't need as many employees."" According to Kantar Worldpanel, both Lidl and Aldi have increased their market share steadily over the last couple of years, with Lidl now accounting for 5.3% of the UK grocery market and Aldi 7.5%. Mr Gottschlich thinks they will continue to grow, though not to the extent that they have in their home country. ""We've not seen the end of growth of discounters. In a few years' time we'll see them with about 20% combined market share. I don't think we'll see growth to the German level where discounters hold about 40% share."" But what about threats to growth? ""The biggest risk will be if we're able to get online groceries delivered at a price and freshness of discount stores. With more development and technology we will see that. That threat exists for everyone and there might be players we don't currently know of [who] achieve it."" One of the ways the discounters attract shoppers is with the so-called ""middle aisle"" - a smörgåsbord of products from kids' toys to electricals. ""If you put some new offers in twice a week to your store there is a reason why customers would want to come in,"" says Mr Gottschlich. ""Those products are negotiated and sourced on a level of 10,000 stores. Huge volumes of those products have been bought and shipped into most stores throughout Europe so we have huge buying power, which means you usually have a strong margin."" And the biggest seller might surprise you. ""We had once a perfume called Madame Glamour - it featured in a blind test on a famous TV show somewhere. It flew off the shelves and we couldn't reproduce it quick enough."" He says it was a bestseller in the UK for a couple of years. ""That really took us by surprise but also showed you how much confidence customers get from TV or celebrity approval."" It's not all successful though. For instance, the supermarket once tested a Spanish red wine that it liked and wine connoisseurs recommended as being good value for money. But customers didn't agree. ""We had a couple of warehouses full of that wine and it took us weeks and months to clear that. There were some warehouse managers scratching their heads, thinking, 'What are they doing trying to source that for our customers?'""","Lidl, along with its fellow German discounter Aldi, might be growing strongly in the UK right now but it wasn't always that way."
"Spark New Zealand wanted to use Huawei equipment in its 5G mobile network. However, a NZ government security agency said the deal would bring significant risks to national security. The move is part of a growing push against the involvement of Chinese technology firms on security grounds. 5G networks are being built in several countries and will form the next significant wave of mobile infrastructure. Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, has faced resistance from foreign governments over the risk that its technology could be used for espionage. Telecoms firm Spark New Zealand planned to use equipment from the Chinese firm in its 5G network. The head of NZ's Government Communications Security Bureau (GCSB) told Spark the proposal ""would , if implemented, raise significant national security risks"", the company said. Intelligence services minister Andrew Little said Spark could work with the agency to reduce that risk. ""As the GCSB has noted, this is an ongoing process. We will actively address any concerns and work together to find a way forward,"" Huawei said. What other countries have concerns? The move follows a decision by Australia to block Huaewi and Chinese firm ZTE from providing 5G technology for the country's wireless networks on national security grounds. The US and UK have raised concerns with Huawei, and the firm has been scrutinised in Germany, Japan and Korea. Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that the US government has been trying to persuade wireless providers to avoid using equipment from Huawei. In the UK, a security committee report in July warned that it had ""only limited assurance"" that Huawei's telecoms gear posed no threat to national security. One country is standing by Huawei: Papua New Guinea said this week it would go ahead with an agreement for Huawei to build its internet infrastructure. The Pacific nation has seen a surge in investment from China over the past decade. What are the fears? Experts say foreign governments are increasingly worried about the risk of espionage by China, given the close ties between companies and the state. Tom Uren, visiting fellow in the International Cyber Policy Centre at Australia's Strategic Policy Institute, said the Chinese government had ""clearly demonstrated intent over many years to steal information"". ""The Chinese state has engaged in a lot of cyber and other espionage and intellectual property theft,"" he said. Links between firms and the government have fuelled concerns that China may attempt to ""leverage state-linked companies to be able to enable their espionage operations"", Mr Uren said. Those concerns were exacerbated by new laws introduced last year that required Chinese organisations assist in national intelligence efforts. The laws enable the Chinese state to compel people and possibly companies to assist if they needed it, Mr Uren said. The combination of new rules and a history of espionage have increased the perceived danger of using companies like Huawei and ZTE in critical national infrastructure. ""It's hard to argue that they don't represent an elevated risk,"" Mr Uren added.",New Zealand has become the latest country to block a proposal to use telecoms equipment made by China's Huawei because of national security concerns.
"Billed as the ""future of footwear"", the $350 (£268) a pair Adapt BB launched on Sunday. However, an update to the Google Android app that allows wearers to loosen or tighten the trainer failed to work. Customers complain that the Android app only syncs with one shoe. The shoe can be controlled manually using two buttons on the side. But people are frustrated that the Android app fails to work. One reviewer on Google Apps, Glenn Jeffries, wrote: ""The software update had an error and now my right shoe won't charge or turn on!!!! To spend $350 on a pair of shoes and not have it to work is embarrassing."" While Chris Sandoval said: ""App wont pair with left shoe. Paired with sneakers right after unboxing then completely crashed after last update."" The Adapt BB contains a small motor which pulls the laces inside the trainer. Nike claims it has reinvented the shoe lace - which ""dates back to 3500 BC, before Stonehenge or the Pyramids"" - with its Adapt BB. Prior to the launch, Nike said: ""Shoelaces: you had a good run. But we think we may have finally bettered you."" Nike has been contacted for comment. It has been a difficult week for the company. On Wednesday, Zion Williamson, a college basketball star for Duke University in North Carolina, slipped and fell when one of his Nike trainers split apart. The incident sent Nike's share price down more than 1% in yesterday's trading.","Nike's new self-lacing trainer, the Adapt BB, has fallen at the first hurdle after the Android app that controls the shoe malfunctioned."
"Last year, customers transferred nearly £240m to fraudsters, only a quarter of which was refunded by financial firms. The Financial Ombudsman service said fraudsters' growing sophistication meant it was wrong to assume losses were due to customer carelessness. The service, which resolves customer disputes, said victims who lost money had a good chance of being reimbursed. ""It's not fair to automatically call a customer grossly negligent simply because they've fallen for a scam. ""That's especially true in light of the sophisticated way criminals exploit banks' security systems - and convince customers that their money is at risk,"" said Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman and chief executive of the Financial Ombudsman Service. She said when a customer had fallen for a fraud or a scam, typically both they and the bank denied they had done anything wrong. Customers hit by fraud One customer called Brian contacted the Ombudsman service after his bank refused to refund him £7,000 in a text message scam. Brian received a message he thought was from his bank and unwittingly gave out his security details and passcodes. As a result, the bank said he had been grossly negligent and refused to refund the money. After reviewing the details, the Ombudsman decided it was a sophisticated fraud, and that the fraudsters had gained Brian's trust and therefore his actions were reasonable. They forced the bank to reimburse Brian's £7,000. Another fraud victim called Jas contacted the Ombudsman over several large withdrawals on her monthly statement which she didn't recognise. The bank said she must have made them herself or given someone her pin number. The Ombudsman found her account of what happened and the details about where she kept her card ""consistent and plausible"". The bank was forced to refund the disputed transactions because the Ombudsman said the bank had also failed to show Jas had been grossly negligent. Ms Wayman said there was ""a very high bar"" for banks to prove customers had been ""grossly negligent"", meaning the banks were not liable for the money their customer had lost. ""If they can't do that, it's likely we'll tell them to cover the money their customer has lost,"" she said. Examples of the tactics used by fraudsters including creating fake websites which look identical to banks' online systems - or text messages which look like they're from someone's bank.","Banks have been warned that it's ""not fair"" to automatically blame customers for money lost through a scam."

Graham Renwick, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said: ""Inditex have returned to premium growth in style. Whilst largely expected, confirmation is comforting.

"By Katie HuntBusiness reporter, BBC News, Hong Kong He plans to spend some of the extra 500 Hong Kong dollars ($64; £39) he will receive each month when the territory's new minimum wage is introduced on a slap-up dinner. ""In five years, I don't think I've eaten pork more than a dozen times and fish never,"" he says one evening after finishing work. Mr Lam is one of the 270,000 Hong Kongers, or 10% of the working population, expected to benefit when the minimum wage of 28 Hong Kong dollars ($3.60, £2.18) per hour takes effect on 1 May. It will mostly affect cleaners, security guards and those working in restaurants and catering. It is the most notable of a number of recent steps Hong Kong's government has taken as it comes under pressure to narrow the territory's widening wealth gap. ""With inflation and the cost of living rising, low-income workers really have a hard time feeding a family,"" says Lee Cheuk-yan, president of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions and a legislator. Free enterprise Hong Kong has long been a bastion of free-wheeling, laissez-faire capitalism and the minimum wage legislation has been fiercely resisted by the business community, who fear it will erode the territory's competitive edge. Business leaders say the level is too high and may force small businesses to lay off staff. ""We have always have been a free enterprise economy and let the market decide what is best,"" says Cliff Sun, chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Industries. ""Now we are twisting this."" He says that 45,000 people may lose their jobs as a result of the wage legislation. ""The level is way over the capability of a lot of small and medium firms."" But union leaders, who had proposed 33 Hong Kong dollars an hour, say that these fears are overstated given Hong Kong's low employment rate and the buoyant state of the economy. Long fight Unions first began campaigning for a minimum wage in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis led to a cut in wages. The government says a lukewarm response by businesses to a voluntary minimum wage scheme in 2006 forced it to introduce the compulsory legislation. However, Hong Kong is late in adopting a minimum wage compared with elsewhere in the region. With the exception of Singapore, most Asian countries now have, or are planning, minimum wage legislation in some form. Even before it takes effect, the new law has sparked heated disputes as some employers have been taking pre-emptive action to avoid a higher wage bill. The new law does not specify if rest days or meal breaks should be paid at the minimum wage. This has led to some workers being rehired on new contracts with unpaid lunch hours and rest days. Others have been switched to being hourly rather than monthly paid staff. Mrs Cheung, who did want to give her full name because she feared her boss would object to her speaking to a reporter, says she has been forced to sign a new contract that reduces her working hours by 2.5 hours a week. And because she will be treated as a new hire she will have no rest days for two months and her annual leave will be reduced. ""It's not really an improvement,"" she says. Tycoon cleaner Not all members of Hong Kong's business community have opposed the legislation. Michael Tien, chairman of Asian fashion chain G2000, was once a big believer in letting the market have a free hand, but he says his views have changed over the past decade as Hong Kong's wealth gap has widened. He became more convinced earlier this year after he worked and lived as a street cleaner earning 25 Hong Kong dollars an hour as part of a television programme. He spent three days sweeping up cigarette butts, litter and fallen leaves with a bamboo brush and heavy metal cart. ""People are really being exploited even though our economy has been booming,"" he says. Mr Tien, who is also deputy chairman of the New People's Party, hopes the minimum wage will encourage Hong Kong businesses to increase productivity and thereby make the economy more, not less, competitive. ""With the correct equipment, it could take a cleaner one hour to clean a block not two hours."" ""You pay more but you need less people."" Daily struggle Rising living costs mean the minimum wage will not lead to a massive improvement in the daily struggle of many low-paid workers. Sat on a bench in the public housing estate where she lives and works, 63-year-old Lau Yuk Na says her monthly income will rise from 6,300 Hong Kong dollars to 7,800. ""The pay rise won't make much difference to me,"" she says, complaining about the price of cooking gas and bus fares. The grime under her fingernails, visible as she hands out slices of pomelo, is testament to the six days a week she works as a street sweeper. An immigrant from mainland China, she says she regrets leaving her homeland 15 years ago for Hong Kong's neon lights but doesn't see any alternative but to carry on working. Her sons only give her a little money each month and she needs to save in case she gets sick in her old age. ""I don't know how to read or write. What else can I do?""",Graveyard sweeper Lam Wai Kau is looking forward to a pay rise.
"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter Would this be belligerent Trump - wagging his finger at the global elite about how divorced they were from reality, from what people really want? Or would this be conciliatory Trump, setting a different tone? We heard the second. The president touched many of the World Economic Forum's erogenous zones. But many were not quite sure how to take it considering the pit bull they were expecting. He talked about the voices of the forgotten - a constant theme here among the ""super-haves"" who are coming to a creeping realisation that the system has to change if faith in the capitalist system is to endure. He talked about economic success being about more than the sum of production, it was about the ""sum of its citizens"". Businesses, he argued, had to remember their obligations to the people who worked for them. Critics will pick at the easy holes. For example, on those income tax cuts it's the wealthy who will gain more. And the business tax cuts are far larger than those for middle-income Americans. Mr Trump said that America First did not mean America Alone. It was the key line of the speech. Fair trade, not trade war And it was a message echoed by other leading members of the White House power pack here, including Gary Cohn, the president's chief economic adviser and head of the US National Economic Council. This is all about trade and the US approach. The fear was that America under Mr Trump would throw up a series of trade barriers, increasing protectionism at a time when most government leaders at Davos - Narendra Modi of India, Justin Trudeau of Canada and Emmanuel Macron of France - were preaching the gospel of globalisation. But today we heard a more nuanced manifesto. America, Mr Trump said, did not want a trade war, it wanted fair trade. Which may come as a surprise to countries like South Korea, smarting this week following the imposition of tariffs on US imports of solar panels and washing machines. Mr Trump's argument is this: The rules of the free trade world were built after the Second World War when America's economic interests were rooted in the successful development of other countries' economies. These countries then became eager customers for American products. That equation has changed. China is a much more powerful economy. The Asian emerging markets, South America and Europe all now have much more muscular dogs in the fight for global trade. Mr Trump said state planning, intellectual property theft and industrial subsidies were the new weapons of trade wars - and used against America. ""Fair and reciprocal trade"" is the new US mantra. And if the administration feels it does not receive such treatment, the president will act - for example, by passing an executive order pulling the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the 12-nation Asian trade deal. Mutual benefit It's a message that has not fallen on stony ground here. ""I don't think it's inappropriate that we re-look at some of the treaties that were so asymmetric,"" Larry Fink, the chief executive of investment company BlackRock, told me. ""Some of these countries now are very strong and very developed. It's going to be a long game. ""The world is benefitting by global trade and we need to find ways of creating more global trade to benefit more humanity worldwide,"" he said. America is still a trading nation, one which gains far more economically from globalisation - world trade - than it does from protectionist measures. And that brute economic truth means that Mr Trump has to play a different tune here - to the business leaders and investors who decide where to place their cash - than maybe to the left-behind voters of the US rust belt. So the president said that America was ready to do bilateral deals that would be ""mutually beneficial"". He even suggested a re-engagement with the TPP. On trade, this was Trump 2.0. The politics might have been angry in the past, but today, economic reality softened the president.",Few people knew what to expect.
"By Edward CurwenBBC Radio 5 Live Wake Up To Money Some of them have been open for nearly a hundred years and they sell to customers across the Midlands and as far afield as south Wales. Everything the market sells has a short shelf life, so there is concern among the traders about any delays at ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, as customs checks are reintroduced on goods from the EU. The government says it is reducing tariffs to zero on 87% of all produce coming into the UK and is doing what it can to ensure there are no hold ups. Traders there have told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money about their preparations for Brexit. 'We're well prepared now' Mark Tate runs George Perry Ltd, a fruit wholesaler that's been trading in Birmingham since 1870. ""We've spoken to a lot of our importers, a lot of farms we deal directly with over in Spain, over in France,"" he says. ""All the fresh produce, it just goes off so quick. The shelf life of the produce is two weeks from the time it's been picked, so we need to get it all in and get it through. ""The main problem is transport. Instead of just going through Calais we're going to have to bring it through Holland and bring it through Newcastle, Harwich, and things like that. That's the conversation we've had. ""The transport companies have put things in place, the importers have put things in place, we've put things in place - so we're well prepared now."" 'We're going to have to pass the cost on' Peter Marshall also sells fruit and vegetables, and imports 95% of the produce he sells - mainly from Holland and Spain. ""We ordered it this morning at 8 o'clock. By 2 o'clock tomorrow morning it will be on our stand and by the evening it will be on somebody's dinner plate,"" he says. He is worried about the extra costs that he might have to pay to bring goods in quickly. ""I dread to think,"" he says. ""We're going to have to pass the cost on. Your profit margin is suddenly going. ""I don't think we can afford to come out with a no-deal."" He adds: ""You cannot have mushrooms in a fridge much longer than three days otherwise the go very soft and they blow and they're worthless. ""So with extra paperwork, extra queues at Dover, unfortunately then the produce would not come into the country in a fit state. ""We've had to get paperwork to import produce from Spain and Holland in case there is a no-deal. We've all got that in place, we're just obviously still up in the air... we don't know what's going on."" 'Everyone's shooting in the dark' Les Clark from Birmingham Egg says he's not worried about tariffs, but prices might still go up. He sells eggs and chicken. ""Everything you see around us is a UK product so generally that won't effect it as in supply,"" he says. ""Obviously if there's no imported chicken coming into the country that will affect the price and that will take the price up."" This morning he's had a checklist from one of his suppliers in Holland - going through what he needs to do to trade if there's a no-deal. It asked him if he was ready to pay tariffs and whether he can use ""transitional simplified procedures"". ""I'm not quite sure what they are to be honest - we've never used them before. Everybody's really shooting in the dark at the moment."" According to the government's Brexit advice, transitional simplified procedures will let companies bring goods into the country and complete their customs declarations after they've been delivered, to try and keep certain goods moving freely. Mr Clark says Brexit would be ""a small thing"" compared to the salmonella crisis in the 1980s, when a scare over the presence of salmonella in eggs caused a dramatic collapse in sales of eggs. ""If we can get through that, we can get through a small thing like Brexit,"" he says. ""Generally what happens when there's a problem in the market is you get a short-term spike then in two or three weeks... it all gets sorted out."" 'Hopefully we can get prices down' Steven Waters at J Vickerstaff & Co says ""virtually nothing"" in his range of fish will be affected by Brexit. ""It's far more a global product than a European thing,"" he says, before pointing out different fish and where they come from. ""New Zealand, South America, Argentina, Morocco, South Africa, Indonesia, Iceland, India, China, St Helena. ""The finest bounties of the ocean make their way to Birmingham... oh and I forgot Uruguay."" He says when we leave the EU new trading relationships are a priority. ""Long-term I would certainly hope we can arrange trade deals to suit our economy, rather than trade deals being put in place to suit the European economy as a whole. ""To benefit the end user, which is obviously the Great British public. Hopefully we can get prices down for them.""","Birmingham Wholesale Market is the UK's biggest mixed wholesale market where almost a hundred traders buy and sell fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and flowers from all over the world."
"The head of the International Monetary Fund says governments around the world could harness the technology to stop illegal activity. The anonymity of currencies such as Bitcoin means they are used by criminals and terrorists, she said. But the technology could be turned against such nefarious activities. Regulators around the world have called for greater crypto-currency oversight. Criminal use Although the technology underlying digital assets has been praised as a way to speed up financial transactions and reduce costs, the anonymity behind crypto-currency trading is a big worry, Ms Lagarde said in a blog post.. What makes the technology so appealing is also what makes it ""dangerous,"" she said, as it can be used as a ""major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism"". But she said the technologies behind crypto-currencies can be harnessed to mitigate this ""peril"". ""The same innovations that power crypto-assets can also help us regulate them,"" she said ""To put it another way, we can fight fire with fire. Regulatory technology and supervisory technology can help shut criminals out of the crypto world."" Distributed ledger technology (DLT) - the technology underlying crypto-currencies - is defined by the UK government as ""an asset database that can be shared across a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions"". Ms Lagarde said that DLT technology ""can be used to speed up information-sharing between market participants and regulators"". She added: ""The technology that enables instant global transactions could be used to create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures."" In addition, other technologies such as biometrics, artificial intelligence, and cryptography ""can enhance digital security and identify suspicious transactions in close to real time,"" she said. Rule overhaul Regulators need to use the same rules ""to protect consumers in both digital and non-digital transactions"", she added. Industry body Crypto UK said regulatory certainty was ""essential to attracting the best of this sector to call the UK home."" But a spokesperson said that regulators should not ""simply retrofit non-digital rules to this unique and evolving sector"". ""Working with industry to develop a tailored framework is crucial to capturing the true value of this technology, whilst weeding out illegal activity,"" the spokesperson added. Crypto-currencies have come under increasing regulatory scrutiny around the world. At the beginning of March, Bank of England governor Mark Carney called for increased regulation after crypto-currency ""mania"". China has gone further by banning initial coin offerings and shutting down digital currency exchanges. Indonesia and Bangladesh have banned Bitcoin for payments, and India's central bank has issued a number of warnings about Bitcoin risks.","Christine Lagarde has called for a crackdown on crypto-currencies, saying the technology can be used to ""fight fire with fire""."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has dropped plans for a single long-term interest rate as a backstop for non-switching savers. Also gone are proposals to restrict fees when exiting investment platforms. The FCA said the decision came ""in light of the ongoing impact of coronavirus and economic conditions"". Loyal savers Savers who leave their money in the same account with one of the major providers can receive as little as 0.1% in interest. Such low rates can apply to instant access savings accounts, as well as easy access cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). Under the plans, firms would have been required to pay long-standing customers the same rate as customers who had recently come off an introductory offer. This would have been known as the Single Easy Access Rate (SEAR). The FCA said the current economic situation, in which savings rates have been slashed, made this less of a problem. ""As interest rates for new products fall, so does the gap between rates paid to new and longstanding customers, and the size of the harm falls,"" it said. Citizens Advice said the FCA needed to ensure the decision was not permanent. ""When the single easy access rate was proposed in January, the FCA predicted it would save people £260m a year,"" said the charity's acting chief executive Alistair Cromwell. ""It's vital the FCA keeps track of how much banks penalise savers just for staying loyal, and it should be ready to implement the single easy access rate when interest rates rise."" Exit fees The FCA has also ended a separate investigation into potentially restricting exit fees charged by investment platforms. It said there had been a shift in the market away from exit fees, and it would continue to monitor the situation. Richard Wilson, chief executive of investment platform interactive investor - which charges a flat fee, said: ""We are saddened to see this news snuck out. ""There are still platforms out there that have grown far too complacent, relying on customer inertia and hefty penalties.""",Plans to protect savers and investors from ultra-low rates and investment platform exit fees have been shelved by the financial regulator.
"The Green Deal Home Improvement Fund offers cashbacks and incentives on such things as double-glazing, insulation and boilers. The first round was criticised for being complicated and low on take-up. But Energy Secretary Ed Davey told the BBC that ""we have learned from what people were telling us"", adding that round two was ""very generous"". Some £120m has been set aside for the revamped programme, with money being issued on ""a first come first served"" basis, Mr Davey said. Depending on the energy-saving project carried out, some money is available only to those who claim within 12 months of moving into their property. Other benefits are offered irrespective of when they moved in. If people meet all the conditions, households in England and Wales will be able to get up to £7,600 back, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said in a statement. The first Green Deal was launched last year in a blaze of publicity, and hailed as one of the biggest home improvement programmes for decades. But just 1,754 signed for phase one. Mr Davey said a key difference with the new phase was that ""these are grants, not loans, and are very generous... We are trying to do everything we can to help people with their energy bills.""",The second round of the government's Green Deal energy saving programme for homeowners opens on Monday.
"John Petter, chief executive of BT's consumer division, has called on the communications regulator to tackle Sky's dominance. It comes after Sky called in March for BT to be broken up. Ofcom said as part of its review that it welcomed ""evidence and analysis from all parties"". It said that its first digital sector review since 2005 was ""broader than our telecoms review 10 years ago"" and that an update on this work to date would be published later this month. In a speech to the Broadcasting Press Guild, Mr Petter cited what he said were ""high prices and poor outcomes for consumers"" arising from a lack of competition in pay-TV. ""Whereas in the energy market regulators have criticised the Big Six operators, in pay-TV Sky has a 64% share, so there is really only the Big One,"" he said. He added: ""Switching in pay-TV is 50% lower than the levels seen in broadband, so it is clear we just aren't seeing the right levels of competition for Sky."" However, a Sky spokesman said: ""The reality is that, in a competitive market, customers are choosing Sky in greater numbers and staying with us for longer because of the quality and value that we offer."" They added: ""This looks like an attempt to deflect attention from the real problems that exist in broadband, where consumers are suffering because of BT's underinvestment and there is concern about competition in the future."" In March, Sky called for called for Openreach - the national broadband network - to be taken away from BT ownership as part of the Ofcom review.",BT has called on Ofcom to broaden its Digital Communications Review to address what it says are competition concerns in the UK pay-TV market.
"Gap's first two outlets will be in Mumbai and the capital Delhi - India's biggest and busiest cities. Gap is partnering with Arvind Lifestyle Brand Limited, a subsidiary of Arvind Limited, which is one of India's largest textile companies. The move comes as Gap reported 3% sales growth for the second quarter. Slowing sales Rivals such as Aeropostale recently reported a 13% drop in second quarter sales, while American Apparel said its same-store sales had fallen by 6% in the second quarter. The clothing retailer currently has 231 Gap stores across Asia. And it aims to open an additional 110 stores this year, across China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. In a statement, Steve Sunnucks, Global President for Gap said: ""India is an emerging, vibrant market and an important next step in our global expansion strategy."" Young population And the company is also hoping to benefit from India's demographic. ""More than half of India's population is under 25 and they are actively embracing fashion in today's retail environment,"" said Ismail Seyis, Vice President of Gap Global Franchise. Gap isn't the only American company looking for opportunities in India, and banking on strong consumer spending from its population of more than 1.2 billion. Last month online retailer Amazon said it will invest a further $2bn (£1.2bn) to boost its operations in India. India's total e-commerce market was worth $13bn in 2013. But online travel accounted for more than 70% of the transactions.","US clothing store Gap is bringing its brand to India with the aim of opening 40 outlets, and it will launch the first two stores early next year."
"The conciliation service Acas said negative attitudes about visible tattoos are outdated. Employers could be drastically reducing the pool of potential recruits because so many young people now have tattoos, Acas said. It said employers should be thinking about relaxing dress codes in general. A Yougov poll in 2015 suggested that nearly a fifth of UK adults have had tattoos, with those under 40 significantly more likely to have them. 'How stupid are you?' Despite the fashion for tattoos in recent years, research commissioned by Acas from academics at King's College, London, suggests that tattoos are still considered unacceptable in many workplaces. 14 tattoos that might help you get a job Several of the 33 people interviewed anonymously for the research said tattoos could be a barrier to hiring in their profession. For example, the research quotes a senior manager in the emergency services commenting on a potential new recruit: ""[The management] said 'why have you got a tattoo there? No, we're not accepting you'. ""She found herself without a job. I said 'well how stupid are you, at what point did you think a tattoo on your head was going to be acceptable?'"" Tidal wave The research suggested there is a strict approach to appearance in the airline industry. ""We have to supply a picture, and also any piercing or any tattoos at all. That's at the application stage and that is governed. [Someone with a visible tattoo]… they won't usually get through the application stage"". Employers, including the manager of a removals firm and the regional director of an accounting firm told the researchers they would be reluctant to hire people with visible tattoos in case it put off clients and customers. However academic Andrew Timming at St Andrews University, who has researched the role of tattoos in hiring practices, says a change in attitudes is inevitable. ""There's a tidal wave of young people with tattoos these days and they're not always going to be young."" ""Employers are going to have to accept that they're integral to the fabric of society and accept that they may potentially have a place at work."" Tattoo fans Rhebecca, who has a number of tattoos, told the BBC that her body art indicates she has qualities that could be beneficial to many employers. ""From the perspective of an employer that [getting a tattoo] takes a lot of planning, organisation, forward thinking and interaction. ""To me those are all things that employers would value."" Maxime Buchi, owner of the Sang Bleu Tattoo studio, said: ""Employers should educate themselves about tattoos and start building an understanding of what they are. ""They should judge a person based on the tattoo they have, not whether they have it or not."" One 27-year old woman, who works as a barrister in London, has contacted the BBC to say she has a number of tattoos and wears them with pride, but she thought it very much depended on having an understanding employer, the type of tattoo and where it was placed on the body. ""I am sure some of my older colleagues and superiors don't necessarily ""approve"", but I think there is an understanding that at this level of professional life your skills as a lawyer should speak for themselves and your appearance is of little importance. ""I'd caveat that, of course, by saying that my visible tattoos are all ""work appropriate"", one is of the symbol of my professional organisation, my Inn of Court, non-threatening in design and on reasonably discreet parts of the body even when they are visible. ""It would be different I think if I had tattoos on my face, or anywhere that I couldn't hide in court dress - or if my visible tattoos contained imagery or text to which one could take offence,"" she added. Missing out In his research Dr Timming found there were some organisations where a tattoo might be deemed an asset - those marketing towards younger people, including bars and clubs or in the creative industries where it can be seen as a sign of original thinking. ""Isn't that what employers are looking for these days? Someone who doesn't always toe the line?"" ""Isn't Richard Branson talking about disruptive talent in the workplace? This is the kind of person who would fit that bill, I would think."" Stephen Williams, head of equality at Acas, said: ""Whilst it remains a legitimate business decision, a dress code that restricts people with tattoos might mean companies are missing out on talented workers."" ""We know that employers with a diverse workforce can reap many business benefits as they can tap into the knowledge and skills of staff from a wide range of backgrounds."" Legally businesses may require tattoos to be covered up in the workplace, if they have a business case for doing so, said Acas.",Employers have been warned they could be missing out on top staff because they are rejecting candidates with tattoos.
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter, BBC News But just when consumers may have got used to the new size criteria introduced by Royal Mail in April 2013, shapes and prices are about to change. Two old types of ""small"" are out, and a ""new small"" will be introduced from 20 October. Prices for the old ""larger small"" will be temporarily reduced - until 18 January 2015. And the complexities get worse. If you chose to use a rival operator, the size and weight criteria are all different. Not to mention volumes - some operators measure in litres and some in cubic centimetres. Do you also know the technical difference between a letter, a packet and a parcel? If you are planning to post a present this Christmas, it is advisable to be good at maths, or at least go shopping with a tape measure and a pair of weighing scales. 'New small' Luckily Royal Mail produces a ""handy"" guide for shoppers, which you can pop in your handbag. But you might need to make space beforehand. The handy guide runs to 16 pages. The key change is that whereas ""small"" used to mean a maximum volume of either 35 x 45 x 8cm (i.e. 12.6 litres) or 25 x 35 x 16cm (i.e. 14 litres) - the ""new small"" will be 35 x 45 x 16cm thus giving you a much more generous 25.2 litres. But if the weight of your parcel goes over 2kg (4.4lb), your parcel will anyway count as medium. In which case you may want to use Royal Mail's specialist parcel service, Parcelforce, or indeed another operator altogether. ""It's incredibly confusing,"" says consumer expert Sue Hayward. ""I think for most people it's almost the luck of the draw when they turn up at the local post office to see how much they'll be charged,"" she says. Litres Be careful how you wrap a parcel too, says Sue Hayward. She recently posted two identical compact mirrors, but made the mistake of wrapping one in a box, and one inside a padded envelope. The one in the box cost £2.80 - the one in the envelope cost £1.20. ""Same product, but that's a huge difference - of £1.60,"" she says. And using a rival service is not necessarily any simpler, or comparable. Collect Plus - which uses a network of 5,500 drop-off points, claims to be cheaper than Royal Mail when it comes to medium-sized parcels that weigh between one and 10kg. But its size criteria are different. Royal Mail's ""medium"" is 1cm longer, but its width and depth criteria are 4cm shorter than those of Collect Plus. MyHermes - another company that uses shops for customers to drop off or pick up - claims to be cheaper than Royal Mail for parcels up to 1kg. Its prices also include tracking, allowing customers to follow a parcel's progress on the internet. Yet its website declares its maximum volume is ""225cm"", presumably meaning cubic centimetres. If that were true, this volume in litres would be just 0.22 litres - a tiny fraction of Royal Mail's volume allowance. ""To work out the volumetric area, if you add the two shortest dimensions of the parcel and multiply them by two, add the length, the total calculation needs to be under 225cm,"" explains a myHermes spokeswoman. And then declares that the maximum volume allowed is actually 82.68 litres. If the operators themselves are having difficulty with the maths, what hope is there for the rest of us? Price comparison Royal Mail's advice for anyone confused is to go along to a Post Office, and take a look at its ""easy-to-use"" templates. Or you can pre-buy some of its boxes, and then see how much you can stuff inside. ""You can buy boxes in the Post Office which are set to the sizes we're pricing on,"" says Nick Landon, Royal Mail's managing director of parcels. ""You can buy these in advance,"" he says. And presumably take them shopping with you. Then there is the matter of Royal Mail's temporary price reduction, on the current larger small size, as it were. From 20 October to 18 January 2015, this will come down from £3.80 to £2.80. Will that price reduction become permanent? ""We will take a view on that in the new year,"" says Nick Landon. No wonder there are now a myriad of parcel price comparison sites on the internet, which do the maths for you. Sue Hayward's advice is to visit them - so saving yourself a bit of money, and a lot of brain-ache.",In the world of parcel post - as in other areas of human activity - size is critical.
"It cut its deposit rate for banks from zero to -0.1%, to encourage banks to lend to businesses rather than hold on to money. The ECB also cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.15% from 0.25%. The ECB is the first major central bank to introduce negative interest rates. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight said: ""Despite being widely anticipated and in some quarters criticised for occurring too late, it is still a bold and unusual move by the ECB to take its deposit rate into negative territory."" ""There has to be considerable uncertainty as to how effective negative deposit rates will turn out to be,"" he added. It has been tried before in smaller economies. Sweden and Denmark, who are both outside the Single Currency, attempted to use negative rates in recent years with mixed results. Analysts said in Sweden it had little discernible impact; in Denmark it did have the effect of lowering the value of the currency, the Krone, but according to the Danish Banking Association it also hit the banks' bottom line profits. Unconventional measures The ECB's president, Mario Draghi, also announced other measures. Long term loans are to be offered to commercial banks at cheap rates until 2018. These loans would be capped at 7% of the amount that the individual banks in question lend to companies. Thus, the more the banks lend to companies, the more money they can borrow cheaply from the ECB. It is also doing preliminary work that could lead to buying bundles of loans that are made to small businesses in the form of bonds. This is being seen as a step towards providing companies with credit through the financial markets. Mr Draghi said the ECB's policymakers unanimously agreed to consider more unconventional measures to boost inflation if it stays too low. The ECB stopped short of instituting a large asset-buying programme like the quantitative easing (QE) undertaken by the US Federal Reserve. However. Mr Draghi insisted that more would be done, if necessary. ""Are we finished? The answer is no. We aren't finished here. If need be, within our mandate, we aren't finished here."" he said. Mr Draghi said that the whole package of measures was aimed at increasing lending to the ""real economy"". ""Now we are in a completely different world,"" he said. Even though some of the measures, like the more to negative rates on deposits, were expected European shares moved higher on the ECB announcement. The benchmark German Dax 30 index jumped above the 10,000 level for the first time. The Cac 40 in Paris was up 0.8% shortly after the ECB's comments. Meanwhile, the euro fell to $1.3558, its lowest level in four months. Deflation fears Although the danger of deflation in the eurozone is limited, the ECB is concerned that growth is very sluggish and bank lending weak - both of which could potentially derail the fragile economic recovery. The eurozone economy grew by just 0.2% in the first quarter of the year. Consumer spending, investment and exports are all growing at a slower pace than this time last year. Inflation in the eurozone fell to 0.5% in May, down from 0.7% in April. This is well below the European Central Bank's target of just below 2%. Unemployment If the eurozone slips into deflation, the fear is that consumers might spend even less because they would expect prices to fall in future months. For the same reason investors could stop investing. Growth would then be hit and demand would be severely constrained. The large debts amassed by the eurozone's countries, companies and banks would take longer and be harder to pay off. Unemployment, which is already at nearly 12% in the eurozone, and much higher in places like Spain, Portugal and Greece, could get even worse. Mr Draghi emphasised that recovery in the eurozone was not just in the hands of the ECB, but also in the domain of the banks and the governments. He said the banks needed to play their part by increasing lending and reforms by national governments should be carried through. ""In order to strengthen the economic recovery, banks and policy-makers in the euro area must step up their efforts. Banks should take full advantage of this exercise to improve their capital and solvency position, thereby contributing to overcome any existing credit supply restriction that could hamper the recovery."" ""At the same time, policymakers in the euro area should push ahead in the areas of fiscal policies and structural reforms,"" he added.","The European Central Bank has introduced a raft of measures aimed at stimulating the eurozone economy, including negative interest rates and cheap long-term loans to banks."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Smart speakers, such as the Amazon Echo device (or Alexa), have been added to the basket of goods used to measure the movement of prices. These price movements of 700 goods and services are used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to calculate the rate of inflation. The latest annual review has also added bakeware but envelopes are out. The addition of baking items, such as trays and roasting tins, reflected the success of TV programmes such as the Great British Bake Off. There are some clear changes from lifestyles in previous decades as the move towards electronic communication, rather than letter-writing, has meant envelopes have been removed. The three-piece suite and crockery sets, once signs of an upwardly-mobile household, have also been taken out as people tend to buy individual items of furniture, rather than a set. The former has been replaced by single settees and the latter by just dinner plates. Washing powder was no longer needed as liquid was being used instead, the ONS said. Hi-fi systems have also gone, made redundant by streaming services as well as smart and portable speakers. However, there is now a place for electric toothbrushes in the basket. Flavoured tea has also been added owing to its rising popularity and increased shelf-space in supermarkets. In all, 16 items have been added this year, 10 have been removed and 16 modified, with 688 unchanged, the ONS said. Basket and the economy Some 180,000 prices are measured in 20,000 UK outlets to calculate inflation, which itself is used as a benchmark for our finances. This basket of goods reflects contemporary habits and technology to work out the inflation rate, which charts the changing cost of living. The ONS also aims to ensure that each sector of goods and services, and where items are bought, are reflected adequately in the calculations. That is why peanut butter, and shop-bought popcorn have also been added this year. Children's fiction, suitable for six to 12-year-olds has also been added, to close a gap in the coverage of books between illustrated books for infants and teenage literature in the basket. ONS senior statistician Philip Gooding said: ""We want to reflect modern spending habits, and the alterations we have made highlight shifting consumer behaviour, whether that is in technology, the home, or the way we communicate with one another. ""It is important to remember that we change a small percentage of the overall basket."" Last year, women's leggings and mashed potato replaced pork pies and lager sold in nightclubs in the inflation basket.","Question: ""Alexa - what is now being used to help calculate the cost of living in the UK?"" Answer: ""I am."""
"There were 7,700 properties repossessed in April, May and June, the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) said, a drop of nearly 4% on the previous quarter. This put repossession levels back to the same position as the last three months of 2012. The number of homes being seized by lenders has been falling in recent years as interest rates stay low. Low-cost mortgages Homes are repossessed if householders fall well behind on mortgage payments and lenders see no prospect of the bill being paid. Repossession figures in the recent financial crisis peaked in 2009 when there were 48,900 homes seized over the course of the year. There are 11.3 million mortgages outstanding in the UK. The numbers have fallen since 2009 owing to the record low level of interest rates. The Bank of England has held the Bank rate at 0.5% for more than four years, and lenders have been competing for relatively few buyers by offering low mortgage rates. In addition, lenders have been under pressure not to repossess properties unless it is genuinely a last resort. They must do a considerable amount to convince the courts that they should seize a borrower's home. Mortgage rates and, in turn, repossessions might be expected to remain low following an announcement of interest rate plans by the Bank of England on Wednesday. The Bank said it would not consider raising the Bank rate until the jobless rate has fallen to 7% or below, which could be another two or three years. The Bank rate is a key factor used by financial institutions when setting their own rates for borrowers and savers. ""Yesterday's message from the Bank of England provides some encouragement to those borrowers who are struggling that any rise from the current historically low Bank rate will be linked to an improvement in the wider economy,"" said the CML's head of policy, Jackie Bennett. Arrears The CML figures show that the number of repossession cases totalled 15,700 in the first half of 2013, the lowest six-monthly figure seen since the second half of 2007. The lenders' group expects repossessions to hit 35,000 by the end of the year. The number of households falling behind on their mortgage payments dropped to its lowest level since autumn 2008 in the second quarter of the year. At the end of June, a total of 157,700 mortgages, equivalent to 1.4% of all loans, were in arrears of 2.5% or more of the balance. The amount of people struggling with severe arrears of 10% or more of the balance was unchanged compared with the first quarter. Housing Minister Mark Prisk said: ""I would urge anyone with financial difficulties to seek advice from their lender early, so that repossession continues to remain the last resort.""",The number of homes repossessed from struggling owners in the UK fell in the second quarter of the year.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) failed to gain explicit consent from individuals before signing them up to the voice ID system for telephone enquiries. Campaigners accused HMRC of creating ""biometric ID cards by the back door"". The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said there had been a ""significant"" breach of data laws. ""Innovative digital services help make our lives easier but it must not be at the expense of people's fundamental right to privacy,"" said Steve Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO. Now the BBC has learned that the tax authority's system will continue despite the deletions. Sir Jon Thompson, HMRC chief executive, said: ""I am satisfied that HMRC should continue to use voice ID."" ""It is popular with our customers, is a more secure way of protecting customer data, and enables us to get callers through to an adviser faster,"" he said in a letter to HMRC's data protection officer. How does the system work? In a bid to speed up the much-criticised HMRC helpline, people were invited to use the voice recognition system, rather than the normal security checks. The scheme, launched in 2017, asks callers to repeat the phrase ""my voice is my password"" to register. Once this task is complete, they can use the phrase to confirm their identity when managing their taxes. HMRC passes the voice through an algorithm to instantly confirm their ID. Similar projects have been launched by banks and other providers, although they have not always been entirely successful, as this BBC investigation found. What went wrong? Privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch complained about the audio signatures system, claiming users were ""railroaded"" into using it as they were not given the choice to opt out. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force across the European Union in May last year, requires organisations to obtain explicit consent before they use biometric data to identify someone, including voice recordings. HMRC has been told by the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) that it was not adhering to the data protection rules. In effect, it had automatically pushed people into the system without explicit consent. The commissioner is issuing the first enforcement notice of its kind to HMRC, under GDPR rules, to ensure the data is deleted. As a result, no fine will be levied. What happens now? The tax authority changed the way it sought permission for voice ID in October. Some 1.5 million people have called HMRC since then, and said they wanted to continue using the service. Their records have been retained. But HMRC has started to delete the voice records of the remaining five million who enrolled into the system before October and who have not called or used the service since. It said the records would be deleted ""well before"" the Information Commissioner's deadline of 5 June. Silkie Carlo, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ""This is a massive success for Big Brother Watch, restoring data rights for millions of ordinary people around the country. ""To our knowledge, this is the biggest ever deletion of biometric IDs from a state-held database. This sets a vital precedent for biometrics collection and the database state, showing that campaigners and the ICO have real teeth and no government department is above the law."" Mr Wood, deputy commissioner at the ICO, said: ""We welcome HMRC's prompt action to begin deleting personal data that it obtained unlawfully. Our investigation exposed a significant breach of data protection law. HMRC appears to have given little or no consideration to it with regard to its voice ID service.""","The voice records of five million taxpayers are being deleted by the UK's tax authority, as the way they were collected broke privacy rules."
"Adelaide chocolate-maker Robern Menz bought the iconic local favourite for an undisclosed sum. While its honeycomb centre makes it similar to the better-known Crunchie, Violet Crumble is the older sweet. Cadbury's Crunchie dates back to about 1929, while the Violet Crumble bar was first produced in 1913. The sale not only brings the confectionery back under Australian ownership, but also returns it to South Australia, where it was produced by manufacturer Rowntree Hoadley until the mid 1980s. Comic ad campaigns Some of Violet Crumble's best known advertisements have been re-hashed by local media on news of Nestle's sale. They include a 1990 television commercial featuring Neighbours actor Shane Connor (Joe Scully) and an angry crocodile at a campsite being roped up by an obedient cattle dog. Tag lines for the chocolate, include ""It's the shatter that matters"", ""Crack a crumble"" and ""The Great Australian Bite"". The deal, which was part-funded by state government grants and loans worth 1.65m Australian dollars ($1.29m; £963,000), will create more than 30 jobs. Nestle Australia told the BBC that selling the Violet Crumble brand would allow it to focus on its bigger names, including KitKat and Milky Bar. Violet Crumble bars have been produced at Nestle Australia's factory in Melbourne since 1983.","Australia's version of the Crunchie bar, Violet Crumble, has been sold by Swiss giant Nestle to an Australian-owned firm."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Some sites may be making misleading claims about discounts, the Competition and Markets Authority said. It is also examining whether sites are giving a false impression of room availability and ""rushing"" customers into booking decisions. The CMA did not name which companies it has been investigating, but leading sites include Expedia and Booking.com. The extent to which a hotel's ranking may be influenced by the size of the commission it pays was another issue highlighted by the CMA. 'Trust' The CMA, which launched its investigation into online booking sites in October, says it has sent warning letters to ""a range of sites"", demanding they review their practices to make sure they are fair and comply with consumer protection law. Concerns include: About 70% of people who shop around for accommodation use hotel booking sites, according to the CMA. ""Booking sites can make it so much easier to choose your holiday, but only if people are able to trust them,"" said Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA. ""We are now demanding that sites think again about how they are presenting information to their customers and make sure they are complying with the law. Our next step is to take any necessary action - including through the courts if needed - to ensure people get a fair deal."" Expedia, one of the leading sites, said: ""Expedia Group continuously aims to deliver attractive travel options at affordable prices in transparent, clear and easy to understand ways, so that our customers can make informed travel choices. Expedia will continue to engage with the CMA on these consumer matters, as it continues its inquiries in the travel sector."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality which represents hoteliers, welcomed the CMA's announcement saying it would bring ""reassurance"" for customers. She added that the inquiry should lead to a wider review of the charges that these booking sites levied on hotels, which led to higher prices for holidaymakers. ""This is another example of digital businesses stealing an unfair lead on honest, regulated operators whose first concern is to deliver good service to their customers,"" she said. Lavinia Dagostine has run a nine-room guest house in Dorset for 11 years and said that these sites could make life difficult for traditional providers. She relies on her own website and return guests before sending vacancies to a booking site. ""It means that smaller B&Bs get left out because they can't afford to pay commission on top of all their other expenses,"" she said. ""I agree it is easier for the booker but the commissions they charge the hotel or B&B sometimes take away any small profit that can be made, making us have to increase our prices."" Unlimited fines The watchdog has ordered the sites, which it has not officially named, to review their practices, and to respond within the next few months. At the end of the review, the sites can either give a legally-binding commitment to change the way they operate, or argue their case that their practices do not break the law. If the CMA disagrees with their arguments, it can take the companies to court, where unlimited fines can be levied. It has also raised various price guarantee claims with the Advertising Standards Authority. Separately, the new EU Package Travel and Linked Travel Arrangements Regulations come into force on Sunday. The changes mean that package holidays consisting of a flight, hotel, car-hire or other tourist services - either bought online for an all-in price or through linked web pages - will get the same protection as packages bought in travel agencies. These protections include being flown home or a refund if a travel company or airline goes bust.","Hotel booking sites must review the way they rank and display rooms, the UK's competition watchdog has said."
"It blamed the profit alert on a ""sharp deterioration"" in UK trade, with sales in the key post-Christmas period ""significantly behind expectations"". Carpetright now expects profits to be between £2m and £6m, compared with analysts' estimates of about £14m. In the 11 weeks to 13 January, like-for-like sales fell 3.6% in the UK. With official data released on Friday confirming 2017 as the weakest year for UK retail since 2013, Carpetright's profit alert will add to concerns that consumers plan to rein in spending this year. The company's fortunes are closely tied to the strength of the UK housing market. Matt Walton: senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Carpetright's profit warning is the latest indication that big-ticket retailers had a tough end to 2017, after Multiyork and Feather & Black fell into administration."" 'Sharply down' In Carpetright's core flooring business, like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings and closures - have fallen 7.1% since Christmas. The company has more than 400 stores across the UK and also has more than 100 outlets outside the UK, in Belgium, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, making it the biggest floor covering chain in Europe. Carpetright chief executive Wilf Walsh said: ""We have seen a significant deterioration in UK trading during the important post-Christmas trading period. ""While average transaction values were up year-on-year, the number of customer transactions since Christmas were sharply down."" In December, Carpetright had said it expected profits to be at the ""bottom end"" of expectations amid a ""volatile and unpredictable"" consumer market. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital, said: ""Profits warnings rarely come alone and so it has proved with Carpetright's shocker today. As we noted in December, the guidance appeared like wishful thinking and so it turned out to be the case. ""Again it's the same old story as with other brands that have failed to adapt to changing consumer trends."" Carpetright's figures weakened shares in some other retailers, with DFS Furniture down 3.8% and home improvement chain Kingfisher 3% lower at midday.",Shares in floor coverings specialist Carpetright have plunged 40% after it warned that full-year profits would be much less than expected.
"The Federal Administrative Court said Switzerland's tax office could not hand over the data as the request was based solely on a suspicion of tax evasion. US tax officials have, for years, been investigating US citizens that they suspect are using Swiss bank accounts to avoid paying tax. These probes have caused political tension between Switzerland and the US. The Swiss government is hoping that new legislation, under which Swiss authorities would provide more help in cases of tax evasion, will help end the dispute. But the US has yet to approve that compromise. In the meantime, US tax authorities are investigating 11 Swiss banks including Credit Suisse and Julius Baer. In 2009, UBS, under pressure from the US, released the names of 4,500 clients and paid a fine. In this latest ruling, the court said that the US Internal Revenue Service needed to present clear evidence of fraudulent intent when requesting information on account holders.",A top Swiss court has blocked the handover of information about a Credit Suisse client to US authorities.
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter The Competition and Markets Authority has launched a probe after hundreds complained they had not received refunds for cancelled package holidays. ""We'll be engaging with Teletext to establish whether the law has been broken,"" said CMA head Andrea Coscelli. ""We will take further action if necessary,"" he added. Some people who complained about the online holiday firm reported they were promised refunds for package holidays by a certain date, only to have the date pushed back. ""We understand that the pandemic is presenting challenges for travel businesses, but it is important that the interests of consumers are properly protected and that businesses comply with the law,"" said Mr Coscelli. Consumer group Which? said it was also still hearing from customers of Teletext Holidays about delays to refunds for cancelled trips. Teletext Holidays is the trading name of Truly Travel, a subsidiary of Truly Holdings. The firm said it was working ""as quickly as possible"" to process refunds. ""Despite the adverse conditions that the travel industry faces and the lack of industry-specific support provided by the government, the business continues to work hard to process refunds as quickly as possible and will work closely with the CMA in order to reach a satisfactory outcome for all our customers as quickly as possible."" Your rights If your travel company cancels a package holiday for any reason, it has to give you a full refund by law within 14 days. Similarly, if you booked a flight (which was departing or arriving in an EU country or the UK or on an EU or UK airline) through a holiday company and the flight was cancelled, you must be reimbursed. But many people have been left waiting months for a payout during the pandemic as travel firms face a cashflow crisis. Since the start of the pandemic, the CMA has written to more 100 package holiday firms to remind them of their obligations to comply with consumer protection law. It has arranged refund commitments from a number of holiday firms, including Love Holidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, TUI UK, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals. LoveHolidays agreed to refund more than £18m to 44,000 customers who had holidays cancelled over coronavirus. It has committed to repay customers in full by March 2021. Meanwhile, Lastminute.com agreed to pay £7m in refunds to more than 9,000 customers by the end of January. The CMA is also investigating whether airlines have breached consumers' legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take due to the pandemic. If it finds that any firm has broken consumer protection law, it can take court action.",Teletext Holidays is being investigated following complaints it has failed to refund people for trips that have been cancelled by the Covid-19 pandemic.
"President Trump told the Journal he had a phone conversation with Apple's chief executive Tim Cook. ""I spoke to (Cook), he's promised me three big plants - big, big, big,"" said President Trump. Apple has declined to comment on the report. President Trump told the Wall Street Journal during the interview that discussed a range of matters including tax reform, that Mr Cook had called him to confirm plans for the plants were ""going forward"". During the campaign last year, President Trump made repeated calls for American companies to produce more in the US in order to create jobs and revive the manufacturing sector. Apple was one of the companies that came under fire. ""We're gonna get Apple to start building their damn computers and things in this country, instead of in other countries,"" Mr Trump said in a speech in January last year. Apple currently manufactures almost all of its products in China but the company employs developers and designers in the US and buys some of its parts from US-based manufacturers such as Corning. A few products are also made by contract manufacturers in the US. In May the Apple chief executive said the company was creating a $1bn fund to invest in advanced manufacturing in the US. Foxconn, a major contractor for Apple, has said it also plans to invest more than $10bn in a display-making factory in the US, possibly in Wisconsin.","Apple's boss has promised to build three new manufacturing plants in the United States, according to an interview President Donald Trump has given to the Wall Street Journal."
"Its government also agreed to cancel its latest licensing round on Thursday, which gives firms permission to search for and produce oil and gas. ""We are now putting a final end to the fossil era,"" said Denmark's climate minister. Greenpeace Denmark described the announcement as a ""watershed moment"". However, the country's latest licensing round was facing uncertainty, after Total of France pulled out in October, leaving only one other applicant. Denmark is currently the largest oil producer in the European Union, although it produces much less than non-EU members Norway or the UK. It pumped 103,000 barrels a day in 2019, according to analysis by UK oil giant BP There are 55 drilling platforms on its territory, across 20 oil and gas fields. ""We're the European Union's biggest oil producer and this decision will therefore resonate around the world,"" Danish climate minister Dan Jorgensen said on Thursday. The decision will cost Denmark about 13 billion kroner (£1.1bn), according estimates by the energy ministry, though it said this amount was subject to substantial uncertainty. A historic milestone By Adrienne Murray, Denmark This move marks a historic milestone. No other sizeable oil producer has taken such a step, Dan Jorgensen tells the BBC. Denmark has been positioning itself as a frontrunner fighting climate change, but its oil production had presented a dilemma. Since the 1970s, Denmark has earned billions of dollars from its North Sea oil. That's also helped finance the country's generous welfare state. ""We want to be climate neutral in 2050. And if we are to have any credibility in that, then this is a necessary decision,"" says Mr Jorgensen. When the current government came to power, Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called it ""the first climate election"". But recently it has faced criticism for not taking more ambitious steps to reach its climate goal. This latest decision now sends a stronger message. Economic factors have played a role. Lower oil prices and higher costs have seen interest wane in the latest round of oil bloc tenders. Even so, about 4,000 jobs depend on the sector - mostly on Denmark's west coast. As part of the new plan, Mr Jorgensen says carbon capture and storage technology will be developed in the area, and new job creation will come from the country's growing off-shore wind sector. 'Green frontrunner' Denmark is regarded as having one of the world's most ambitious climate targets. It aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 70% by 2030, as well as reach net zero emissions by 2050 - both targets which have been passed into law. Helene Hagel, head of climate and environmental policy at Greenpeace Denmark, said that the new announcement meant ""the country can assert itself as a green frontrunner and inspire other countries to end our dependence on climate-wrecking fossil fuels. ""This is a huge victory for the climate movement and all the people who have pushed for many years to make it happen."" Governments around the world have also committed to take further action on climate change as part of a wider plan to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The UK will aim to cut its carbon emissions by at least 68% of what they were in 1990 by the end of 2030, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Friday. Scientists have said, however, that even if the UK and other nations keep their promises on cutting emissions there was no guarantee the world would avoid serious global warming.","Denmark will end all new oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, as part of a wider plan to stop extracting fossil fuels by 2050."
"It replaces AT&T, which first joined the US stock market barometer in 1916. Despite being one of the most successful US firms, Apple was excluded from the Dow because its high stock price would have distorted the price-weighted index. But a change in the structure of Visa shares, which is in the same sector, has made room for the iPhone maker. From 18 March, Visa shares will be split four-for-one, which reduces the weighting of the information technology sector in the overall index. ""As the largest corporation in the world and a leader in technology, Apple is the clear choice for the Dow Jones Industrial Average,"" said David Blitzer, chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Apple's own seven-for-one stock split last June also helped pave the way for it to join the Dow Jones. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is calculated by taking the sum of the share prices of its 30 stocks and dividing the total by a number known as the Dow Divisor. The divisor is continually adjusted to accommodate structural changes to companies and to maintain continuity. Dow Jones Fact File Source: McGraw Hill Financial As the Dow includes only 30 companies, critics argue it does not accurately reflect the broader market. The S&P index by contrast includes 500 stocks. ""This brings the Dow into reality and the 21st Century,"" said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at Philadelphia Trust Co, referring to Apple's entry. ""It will make the Dow a more interesting index to watch, but also more volatile since it is replacing a nice, steady old name with an interesting and exciting tech and retail company."" All change With a market value of around $736bn, Apple is the biggest US company measured by market capitalisation. Since the launch of the iPhone in June 2007 its shares have risen 700%. AT&T is worth $176.5bn and its exit from the Dow Industrials leaves Verizon as the only telecoms company on the index. AT&T had an almost unbroken run on the Dow stock from 1916 with only a brief absence in 2004 to 2005.","Apple, the biggest US company by market value, will be included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 19 March."
"The bank was told to examine how it pays top executives, and how they are rewarded for taking on risk. JP Morgan and its board agreed to submit a plan within 60 days. However, the US Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency stopped short of apportioning blame or fines for the trading errors. Stricter controls In April, reports emerged of a London-based trader, Bruno Iksil who was called the London Whale because the positions he took were big enough to move markets. This is the first regulatory action since the bank revealed it had lost $6.2bn (£3.8bn) in those derivatives trades. Regulators asked the bank to tighten internal controls, risk management and oversight from the board. JP Morgan said it ""has been working hard to fully remediate the issues"". The bank's own report into the incident is due to be published this week when JP Morgan announces its fourth-quarter earnings. JP Morgan still faces investigations by the US Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the UK Financial Services Authority among others. Money laundering In a separate case the OCC and the Federal Reserve also criticised the bank for lapses in its anti-money laundering rules. It comes after JP Morgan reached a settlement of $88m with the US Treasury Department in 2011, in a case of violating US sanctions. The accusations centred around wire transfers processed by JP Morgan to Cuba and Sudan, as well trade loans with Iran. JP Morgan said it had made progress addressing the issues.","JP Morgan Chase, which lost billions of dollars in trades by an employee known as the London Whale, must revamp its risk management, regulators have said."
"In November, the government allowed Virgin and Stagecoach to withdraw from running the service three years early. Lord Adonis, former chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, said the move could eventually cost the taxpayer billions of pounds. Sir Richard said the deal had cost Virgin and Stagecoach £100m. In 2014, Virgin and Stagecoach signed a deal to run the East Coast line until 2023, promising the government £3.3bn in premiums. In a blog published on Friday, Sir Richard said the two companies had been promised a huge upgrade of the tracks by Network Rail, which would have improved reliability and allowed more passengers to be carried. ""Considerable delays"" to the upgrade and poor track reliability ""torpedoed"" the assumptions of the original bid, the blog said. Sir Richard said he and his partners had not benefitted from the government's move, but had lost ""well over £100m in total"" without receiving a penny in dividends. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent Virgin/Stagecoach were meant to pay around £1.6bn to the government in the final years of the contract. It will be a while before we know how much the new company will pay instead, but bearing in mind that Virgin/Stagecoach were losing cash, it is bound to be less. Lord Adonis says other struggling rail firms might ask for similar help. He writes in his letter: ""The bailout will cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds, possibly billions, if other loss-making rail companies demand equal treatment. ""It benefits only the billionaire owners of these companies and their shareholders, while pushing rail fares still higher and threatening national infrastructure investment."" More from Richard Westcott Although Lord Adonis accepts Network Rail failed to meet some of the promises on which Virgin and Stagecoach based their bid to run the franchise, he called the move to release the companies from the contract ""indefensible"". He also said he was ""ready to share troubling evidence with the Public Accounts Committee and other Parliamentary committees investigating the bailout"". The details of the new East Coast contract have yet to come out.",Sir Richard Branson has hit back at critics who say the government has bailed out Virgin Group and its partner in the East Coast rail franchise.
"The UN's Food Price Index rose 2.2% in February to the highest level since the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) began monitoring prices in 1990. It also warned that spikes in the oil price could make the ""already precarious"" situation in the food market even worse. Apart from sugar, the FAO said all commodity groups had risen in price. Oil prices recently hit two-and-a-half year highs due to political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East. The FAO said the volatility in the oil markets was adding to an already difficult and uncertain situation. ""This adds even more uncertainty concerning the price outlook just as plantings for crops in some of the major growing regions are about to start,"" said the FAO's David Hallam. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it was ""extremely concerned"" about the situation. IMF spokesperson Caroline Atkinson pointed to the ""impact on the poorest and most vulnerable, particularly in the low-income countries, but not only there"". The prices of cereals, such as wheat, rice and maize, have risen by 70% in the past year. This is largely due to droughts in eastern Europe and floods in Australia - both major crop producers. The FAO said it expected world cereal production to have declined overall last year. In addition, it is also forecasting higher demand for agricultural products for food, animal feed and fuel production. These conflicting pressures could push prices higher. The FAO, however, said there were positive early signs that agricultural areas in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan had begun to recover from last year's droughts and wildfires.","Global food prices have hit record highs, and could rise even further, according to the United Nations."
"By Konstantin RozhnovBusiness reporter, BBC News Under Russian trade law, the government is free to do so if prices rise by 30% in 30 days, so in theory it could introduce a maximum price of a food product in any region of the country for 90 days. Take the price of buckwheat, an extremely popular meal among Russians. Its price rose by between 30% and 84% in almost half of Russia's regions, according to the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development. And in the weeks and months ahead, buckwheat prices are set to rise further, along with the price of rice, eggs and milk, after prolonged drought during summer destroyed crops across the country. It is worst for the poor, of course. For people such as Liliya, 41, who lives in the Ivanovo region. Every month, she spends a couple of weeks in Moscow to earn money for her family. And next time she goes she will buy a lot of flour and a bread baking pan, as ""it is unclear what the situation will be like when winter comes"". Stockpiling Officials are eager to stress that there is no danger of any food shortages. Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov is advising Muscovites ""not to stock up"" and insists the city ""will be fully supplied with cereals [such as semolina, buckwheat and millet], and with rice, of course"". Most people blame the drought, which lasted until the end of August, for the soaring cost of food, but policymakers insist this rush to stock up is also pushing up prices. ""People who have never eaten buckwheat in their whole life, now suddenly run to the shops to buy big 10kg sacks of the stuff,"" Andrei Tsyganov, deputy chief of the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, told RBC Daily, a Russian business newspaper. Ivan Nikolaev, consumer goods analysts at Aton brokerage, says both views are reasonable. The drought has accounted for about 60% of the price rises, he estimates, with the remaining 40% caused by ""panic buyers or speculators"". Importing food Speculators would lose out if price controls were introduced, of course, but for now the government remains reluctant about stepping in. There are no real shortages as there is enough supply in the market to satisfy current demand, according to economic development minister Elvira Nabiullina. Indeed, she believes it could be counter-productive to curb food prices and points to how price limits in one region could result in traders in other regions raising their prices too. Fresh shortages would emerge and the black market would thrive. Mr Nikolaev from Aton believes a ban on grain exports, which was introduced in August, should be enough for now to keep the food supply situation under control. And he points out that controlling prices is just one of several options, such as farm subsidies, available for the government. But not everyone is mollified. Some regional and federal officials have been talking about importing cereals and milk from China and other countries. 'Slap the wrists' The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service has started hunting down the speculators, conducting snap checks to prevent them from making money from the misery caused by the drought. Yet there is plenty of evidence that the market is being manipulated. Salt prices, for instance, have risen sharply in the wake of the drought. So President Dmitry Medvedev has taken an interest, urging officials to publish timely information about actual supplies of food products in an effort to make it harder for speculators to create panic. ""We need to explain [the situation to the Russian people], and we should slap the wrists of those who try to inflame the situation,"" he says. The Russian government is now waiting for Rosstat to publish its August statistics to find out exactly how much of the price rise was driven by the drought. Only after analysing the figures will it make a decision about whether or not to regulate prices. For Russia's poor, the wait is painful. ""My salary stays the same so my food budget stays the same, but food prices are soaring,"" says Lyubov, 56, a working pensioner from Moscow. ""So if buckwheat gets much more expensive, I might have to stop eating it with milk, as I usually do, because I will not be able to afford it.""","There is fear in drought-stricken Russia where the price of some essential food products soared 30% in August, but though the heat is on to make the government intervene it is dragging its heels."
"A US Congressional report revealed UK officials, including Chancellor George Osborne, added to pressure by warning the US it could lead to market turmoil. The report alleges the UK ""hampered"" the probe and ""influenced"" the outcome. HSBC was accused of letting drug cartels use US banks to launder funds. The bank, which has its headquarters in London, paid a $1.92bn (£1.48bn) settlement but did not face criminal charges. No top officials at HSBC faced any charges. 'Serious implications' The report says: ""George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, the UK's chief financial minister, intervened in the HSBC matter by sending a letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke... to express the UK's concerns regarding US enforcement actions against British banks."" The letter said that prosecuting HSBC could have ""very serious implications for financial and economic stability, particularly in Europe and Asia"". Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said a series of factors were considered when deciding how to resolve a case, including whether there may be ""adverse consequences for innocent third parties, such as employees, customers, investors, pension holders and the public"". The report also accuses former US Attorney General Eric Holder of misleading Congress about the decision. The report says Mr Holder ignored the recommendations of more junior staff to prosecute HSBC because of the bank's ""systemic importance"" to the financial markets. 'Misleading comments' ""Rather than lacking adequate evidence to prove HSBC's criminal conduct, internal Treasury documents show that DOJ [Department of Justice] leadership declined to pursue [the] recommendation to prosecute HSBC because senior DOJ leaders were concerned that prosecuting the bank 'could result in a global financial disaster',"" the report said. Instead, the Department of Justice and HSBC reached the settlement, which some politicians criticised for being too lenient. Testifying before Congress in 2013 Mr Holder said the size of some financial institutions can make it difficult to bring criminal charges. He later tried to clarify those remarks telling Congress: ""If we find a bank or a financial institution that has done something wrong, if we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, those cases will be brought."" Congress's report deemed these comments to be misleading in light of emails from Treasury Department staff that recommended criminal charges. Mexican cartel The 2012 settlement with HSBC detailed how the bank violated US sanctions by conducting business for customers in Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba. HSBC accounts were also used by the Sinaloa drug cartel in Mexico and Norte del Valle cartel in Colombia to launder $881m. The settlement allowed the bank to avoid pleading guilty to any wrongdoing. If HSBC had been proven guilty of criminal action, it could have lost its banking charter in the US. HSBC and US regulators declined to comment on the report. The UK Treasury has not commented either.","US officials refused to prosecute HSBC for money laundering in 2012 because of concerns within the Department of Justice that it would cause a ""global financial disaster"", a report says."

She recently went head-to-head with another blogger, Sunneva María Svövudóttir from Reykjavik in Iceland, on World Business Report - have a listen to hear Chelsea talk about what she spent her money on this week. Chelsea's week: A spontaneous painting project and a pizza party I woke up at 6:45 today to get ready for work. I am already in a good mood because I normally have to wake up at 6:00 for work, but due to the holidays my daily rush-hour commute to work is cut down by 45 minutes. I work on the other side of LA, so on a normal day it takes me about one hour and 15 minutes to make the 10-mile journey to my job. However, today the city is almost empty so it takes me under 30 minutes to arrive at work. I would love to live closer to my job, but my crippling student loan debt doesn't allow me the luxury of living near my office, which happens to be situated in one of the most expensive neighbourhoods in the United States. I arrive a bit early today, so I walk across the street to a coffee shop and get an iced coffee for $3.78 (£2.90). I bring my lunch with me to work and don't spend anything else the rest of my work day. On my way home from work I need to stop and charge my car since it is fully electric. I charge at a public charger for one hour to get 20 miles which costs me $1.38. When I get home my boyfriend and I celebrate the fact that neither one of us has to work the next two days by forgetting about our healthy food-only diet and ordering a bunch of pizza. We alternate who pays for meals and today is my turn - $21.75. After eating enough pizza to make even yoga pants feel too tight, I decide I cannot do anything other than lay on the couch and watch Netflix all night. We make it half way through an hour-long episode, before I pass out asleep for the evening. Total spend: $26.91 Today is New Year's Eve and I have the entire day off as well as tomorrow - woohoo! My boyfriend and I sleep in and have a light breakfast at home since we both still feel full from our pizza party last night. We are planning on celebrating New Year's at a friend's house who is throwing a small party. We decide to go to Costco to pick up a bottle of alcohol and hostess gift since they typically have the best prices on items in my area. We decide on a bottle of Japanese whisky $32.84 and a box of liquor filled chocolates $18.60. We also get a bag of dog food while we are there since we are running low $43.57. We decide to eat leftovers at home versus grabbing a bite somewhere since we are now running behind. At 8:45 we leave to our friend's party. We call an Uber car and the 24-minute drive to her house costs $26.85. We spend the next few hours drinking cocktails, eating appetizers, and listening to music with friends. At around 1:30 we decide to call it a night and head home. We check the Uber app and the cost to call a car home has now skyrocketed to over $100! There has been a fare surge due to the holiday so we decide to hang out longer and wait for prices to drop. At around 2:15 we check transportation prices again and they have been cut in half, still not what we want to spend but we are tired and eager to get home at this point. We call the car and spend $50.45 to get back home. Spending the car ride dreaming of getting into warm pyjamas and out of my uncomfortable heels and dress justifies the awful price for just a moment. My boyfriend and I split the cost of everything 50/50 today so I'm fine with what I've spent, considering it's a holiday. Total spend: $86.16 Today is New Year's day! A day where it is socially acceptable to lounge around and practice the art of doing positively nothing. I am off work today and because we stayed out so late last night I end up waking up after 11:00am - oops, half the day is already gone. After complaining I am hungry for 30 minutes but not doing anything about it, my boyfriend agrees to go out and track us down some mid-afternoon breakfast bagels. He returns 30 minutes later with breakfast as well as additional food for dinner later. Both my stomach and my wallet are very happy. After we eat we spend the rest of the day uneventfully playing video games and watching movies on Netflix, and congratulating ourselves on being adults and not getting drunk last night just because it's a holiday. I remember my college days of spending an entire paycheck on dresses and drinking just because it was a holiday. Thanks but no thanks - welcome to adulthood. Normally my student loans come out of my account on the first of each month, but the banks are closed today so the withdrawal will not happen until tomorrow. I somehow made it through the day without spending a dollar - a New Year's miracle! Total spend: $0 Back to work today. I wake up a little late this morning and struggle to get out of bed. My sleeping schedule is messed up from my days off. I eventually get out of bed and realize I wasted so much time I now don't have time to make breakfast. I grab a protein bar and rush out the door. I get to work and realise I forget to bring my lunch. Ugh, I hate when this happens. When lunch time rolls around I walk down the street from my work to a local juice shop and get an acai bowl $10.90. Today my student loans also come out of my account $859. I put a big portion of any extra income I get during the year towards my student loans so I can hopefully get them paid off quicker and not have the interest pile up. Sometimes seeing my friends spend their extra income on vacations and travelling I can feel down, thinking that this mountainous black hole of debt will never go away. However, for the most part I always try to remain positive about the situation. I should feel grateful that I have a job that pays me enough to always pay my bills on time, something that hundreds of thousands of people in America who are plagued with monumental student loan debt struggle to do while also carrying the burden of keeping their families afloat. Thinking of this today is a great reminder to always be thankful and grateful for what I have. Total spend: $869.90 I wake up early enough today to do a quick meditation. I've been trying to meditate more and more the last few months. I would love to join a local class but the costs in my area are outrageous for something I can do at home. I pack some berries and chia seed pudding I made for lunch and make my way to work. At lunchtime I notice I have a notification on my phone to put in my produce delivery order today. I subscribe to a wonderful food delivery service that focuses on the elimination of food waste. Weekly or bi-weekly I log onto my account to shop a list of ""imperfect"" food items that are perfectly fine but cannot be sold in stores due to being too small, an odd shape, or there is simply a surplus of an item. We are able to buy an abundance of fresh organic fruits and vegetables this way at highly discounted prices. I have saved so much money using this service over the past few years since I am a vegetarian and my main food staples are fruits and vegetables. The order I place today comes to $16.82 for 10lbs of organic produce. I don't order too much because I still have a little left from last week's order. My car lease payment has also been automatically deducted from my account today $146.59 as well as my car insurance $142.04 and home insurance $32.01. On my way home from work I stop and pick up a caprese sandwich and green salad for dinner $13.14. I get home and catch up on some Real Housewives shows since my boyfriend is working late tonight. Total spend: $350.60 Even though it's Saturday I wake up early. I listen to a podcast and clean up the house a bit while simultaneously drinking coffee and a protein shake. While I am cleaning I notice some stains on the walls that are not coming off. I actually noticed it a few weeks ago but now feel as though they are getting worse and it's driving me crazy! I don't have any plans today so I make the impromptu decision to paint the walls. My boyfriend tries to talk me out of it saying we should have it done professionally. I briefly look online and see prices of several hundred dollars to have a room painted. No thanks, I'll figure it out. I drive 10 minutes to a home improvement store and spend an hour picking out brushes and other accessories, and deciding between egg white and ultra pure white. Before admitting to myself I have no idea what I'm doing, and putting everything back in exchange for a pre-assembled painting kit, and googling the best brand of white wall paint to buy. I make it out of the store with probably not everything I need at $83.08. I rush home and down some leftovers so I can quickly begin painting. Before I know it it's dark out and time to eat dinner. I am only half way done with my painting project so my boyfriend offers to go pick us up some food for dinner (anything to get out of the possibility of painting I suppose). After eating I spend the rest of the evening painting, scrubbing spilled paint... and thinking about how I should have just paid a professional. However, with the cheap cost of DIY plus spitting the cost of supplies with my boyfriend it was ultimately worth it. Total spend: $41.54 After spending the entire day inside yesterday painting I wake up feeling like I immediately need to get out of the house. I throw on some clothes and take my dog for a walk to a nearby juice shop. I get a green juice $8.75 and slice of zucchini bread $2.75 for breakfast and a quinoa veggie bowl to go for lunch later $11.99. After breakfast we walk past a nearby pet shop. My only two money vices in life - makeup/skincare and dog anything. After a three-hour shopper's blackout in Sephora six months ago I actually forbid myself from buying any cosmetics until I run out of what I currently have. Dog stuff is still fair game since he's my one and only child. I find a bag of treats, a chew toy, lavender-scented waste bags, senior vitamins and a mommy's best buddy t-shirt all on sale totalling $33.95. On the way out I also give a $15 donation to a local dog and cat fundraising team outside. After lunch I meet a friend for coffee $4.85 and charge my car at a nearby public charger for an hour and 10 minutes while I'm there $1.17. This evening my boyfriend and I go to a friend's house for dinner, who insists we do not bring anything at all along with us. Afterwards we head home to relax and get ourselves ready for the week ahead. Total spend: $78.46 How does Chelsea feel about her week? I spent a little spontaneously this week which is alright because of a handful of monetary gifts I received from family members for the holidays. A lot of my spending this week also went towards food and a few of my monthly bills. Overall I am fine with my spending this week when looking it over. I try to balance responsible spending while I'm working to pay off my student loans while also allowing myself occasional frivolous spending without guilt or thinking about it since I work hard for my money! Total weekly spend: $1,453.57 (£1,107)","My Money is a new series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make.

"The Department for Business said the aim was to tackle unfair practices, such as high rents and the prices publicans have to pay for beer. Campaigners have complained for years of being exploited by ""pubcos"". Pubcos are the large firms that own thousands of pubs and bars and decide where tied landlords can buy beer from and at what price. About half of all pubs in the UK are owned by pubcos. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he also wanted to establish a new statutory code to look at the relationship between pubcos and publicans, and which would be enforced by the adjudicator. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said it was disappointed that self-regulation had not been given a proper chance. ""Whilst the Association believes that statutory underpinning of recent industry reforms will result in unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy, it does however, welcome the endorsement of the tied house model and the clear distinction drawn between leases and traditional brewery tenancies,"" it said. BBPA chairman Jonathan Neame added: ""In the consultation, we will be urging the government to ensure that any statutory process is light-touch and cost-effective, to protect consumers from bearing the brunt of unreasonable additional costs."" 'Genuine progress' The Fair Pint campaign, which aims to help publicans get a fair deal, welcomed the announcement. ""For far too long, tied pub tenants have been abused by big pub owning companies. Many have lost their livelihoods, savings and have lived in fear of losing their home,"" said publican and Fair Pint campaigner Simon Clark. ""Today's announcement comes after many years of highlighting this unfairness. ""There is work to be done on the detail and we believe that a free of tie option would be the best way of guaranteeing fairness in tied deals, but this represents genuine progress which will give a boost to publicans and consumers by increasing the viability of local pubs."" The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) has been calling for urgent action to help landlords against the financial pressures they face. Camra said in a report in November that 18 pubs a week were closing in the UK, up from 12 a week a year earlier. The government's proposals come a day before a scheduled House of Commons debate on a statutory code of practice for pub companies. The debate was forced by Labour, who have long been pushing for action to save pubs from closing. 'Hardship' The proposed adjudicator will have the power to carry out investigations and impose financial penalties. ""There is some real hardship in the pubs sector, with many pubs going to the wall as publicans struggling to survive on tiny margins,"" Mr Cable said. ""Some of this is due to pubcos exploiting and squeezing their publicans by unfair practices and a focus on short-term profits. ""I hope these measures mean publicans are given a fairer chance at running their pub, which in turn will help them grow their businesses instead of losing them."" He added that he had given the pubcos one last chance to change their behaviour last year, but it was clear that the self-regulatory approach was not enough. Paul Kenny, general secretary of the GMB union, which has campaigned on behalf of pub landlords, said: ""If Vince Cable sticks to this plan, this is a welcome step forward. It is a tribute to the hard work by GMB-tied tenants who did not give up their demands for a fair deal."" A formal consultation on the proposed measures will be launched in the spring.",The government has announced plans for an independent adjudicator in the pub industry to help struggling landlords.
"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News Japan's surprise move to weaken the value of the yen was a bold move, but the government is well aware that such actions have a mixed record of success. Earlier this year, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) began large-scale buying of euros. The aim was to halt the inexorable rise of the Swiss franc and to maintain the competitiveness of the economy. But the franc continued to appreciate, and in July the currency was at an all-time high against the euro. Since then the SNB has been offloading parcels of euros, pushing the currency even lower against the franc. Central banks rarely telegraph their plans to dip into the market. And details about the scale of their interventions are even rarer. This information vacuum is filled by rumour, and since July the SNB has been dogged by periodic speculation that it is offloading another tranche of euros. And this helps up the franc. The exercise has been self-defeating. Yet, despite plenty of scepticism among analysts as to whether intervention works, policymakers see it as an essential part of their armoury. In the past couple of years Mexico, Poland, Indonesia, and Russia are among countries that have acted to protect their currencies. Last year Russia is thought to have spent $210bn to maintain the rouble at a rate of 41 roubles against a basket of dollars and euros. The rouble is now at 34.86 versus the basket. The Swiss and Russian examples suggest their actions backfired. Yet, who knows how strong or weak the franc and rouble would be if there had been no intervention. Humiliation One definite example of a failure of intervention was in 1992, when the UK attempted to shadow the German Deutschmark and stay in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. In just one day, the UK spent billions of pounds defending sterling's value. But the foreign exchange markets knew it was pointless, and kept selling. Britain suffered a humiliating defeat, and a little-known currency trader called George Soros made a lot of money. Of course, central banks intervene for different reasons. Britain wanted to defend sterling, whereas Switzerland wanted to weaken the franc. And influencing the supply and demand of currencies is only one reason central banks intervene. It can also send important signals about future monetary policy and policymakers' assessment of whether a currency is divorced from economic fundamentals. But Japan's previous attempts at intervention, six years ago, failed to stop the yen's appreciation despite a 15-month spree of buying dollars. Tohru Sasaki, currency strategist at JP Morgan, said in a research note last month: ""There is no historical case in which [yen] selling intervention succeeded in immediately stopping the pre-existing long term uptrend in the Japanese yen."" This latest action at least had the desired result on day one - weakening the yen against the dollar by about 3%. But this is a long-term game, designed to push up the prices of imported goods and lift Japan from the deflationary spiral that has damaged the economy for years. The success of this plan will not be known for some time. One reason that Japan's move took the markets by surprise was that currency traders did not expect intervention - if at all - without support from partners in the G7 group of leading economies. Jean-Claude Junker, chairman of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, told reporters: ""Unilateral actions are not the appropriate way to deal with global imbalances."" Asian impact Economist Nouriel Roubini said history shows that co-ordinated action by central banks works better that unilateral action. But it does not appear that the US Federal Reserve or European Central Bank are involved, Mr Roubini said. What's more: ""We are in a world where everyone wants a weak currency."" Japan's move pushed the dollar higher, something Washington wants to resist as it makes US exports more expensive. Following Japan's move, the dollar also rose against the currencies of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, and, crucially, the Chinese yuan. The US has accused China of artificially dampening the yuan the boost exports, something Beijing rejects. Analysts are now asking if central banks in these Asian countries will weaken their own currencies to counter Japan's impact on their economies. It is a reminder that central bank interventions do not happen in isolation. When a currency is sold, another must be bought.",The law of unintended consequences is rarely as true as when applied to currency interventions.
"Speaking at a gathering of bank bosses in Frankfurt, Josef Ackermann said he was ""stating the obvious"". His comments come as Greece is asking private investors to swap their current Greek bonds for others that pay less interest over a longer term. This has raised concern that other eurozone nations may do the same. 'Limited growth' Mr Ackermann said: ""It's stating the obvious that many European banks would not survive having to revalue sovereign debt held on the banking book at market levels."" He added that the continuing sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone would limit bank profits for a number of years. ""The outlook for the future growth of revenues is limited by both the current situation and structurally,"" he said. Mr Ackermann also said he was opposed to the idea of eurozone-wide bonds replacing those of each national government. This has been suggested by some economists as a way to stabilise the debt crisis by sharing out the debt of the most debt-laden nations, such as Greece and Portugal, across the 17-nation strong eurozone region. The German and French governments have also both expressed their opposition to the euro bond idea. Balanced budgets Speaking at a separate conference in Paris, the incoming president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, also ruled out euro bonds. Instead, he said the eurozone needed a ""quantum"" leap towards further economic integration, with tougher rules on budget discipline. There is a proposal led by France and Germany that eurozone countries should be required to balance their budgets. Mr Draghi also said nations must ensure that the fund set up to bail out any eurozone countries in financial difficulty - the European Financial Stability Facility - had sufficient money to allay any concerns about its funding levels. Currently the governor of the Bank of Italy, Mr Draghi is due to replace Jean-Claude Trichet in the top job at the ECB on 1 November.","A number of European banks would not survive a cut in the value of their sovereign debt investments, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank has warned."
"In addition, three of its former traders were charged in New York with several counts of wire fraud. They face a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison for each count if convicted. Libor rates are used to set trillions of dollars of financial contracts, including many car loans and mortgages, as well as complex financial transactions around the world. 'Inexcusable' Regulators have been investigating manipulation of Libor inter-bank lending rates since 2012 in the wake of Barclays' £290m ($454m) fine by US and UK authorities. A string of international banks have been implicated in the affair, and several criminal charges have been brought against traders. In a statement, Michael Spencer, ICAP's chief executive, said: ""We deeply regret and strongly condemn the inexcusable actions of the brokers who sought to assist certain bank traders in their efforts to manipulate YEN Libor. Their conduct contravenes all that ICAP stands for."" Mr Spencer added that none of the three individuals charged - Colin Goodman, Daniel Wilkinson and Darrell Read - remained with the firm, and others who may have been involved had already left the company. The US Department of Justice said in a statement: ""In exchange for bigger bonus checks, the three defendants undermined financial markets around the world by compromising the integrity of globally used interest rate benchmarks."" Email exchanges - some with the subject heading ""Suggested Libors"" - between the three men were disclosed in court filings to support claims the men orchestrated attempts to fix the rate. Mr Goodman, referred to in emails as Lord Libor, allegedly writes of needing to fix the three-month and six-month Libor rates. One email says: ""Morning Lad. On the scrounge again, if possible keep 3m [three months] the same and get 6mos [six months] as high as you can. ""My guy has an enormous fix on Wednesday in 6mos and will want it as high as possible. Waiting for my credit card to get returned to me from a drunken night out bowling, but will be supplying you with copious amounts of curry on it's imminent return. Cheers"". Meanwhile, Mr Read was said to have told a trader that Mr Goodman was ""ok with an annual champagne shipment, a few p*** ups... and a small bonus every now and then"". In another email, Mr Read told Mr Wilkinson: ""Dan this is getting serious [UBS trader] is not happy with the way things are progressing... Can you please get hold of Colin and get him to send out 6mos libor at 0.865 and to get his banks setting it high. This is very important because [UBS trader] is questioning my (our) worth."" 'Cavalier disregard' In February 2013, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was fined £390m ($610m) by UK and US regulators for its part in the Libor scandal. The UK's Financial Services Authority fined RBS £87.5m, while about £300m was paid to US regulators and the US Department of Justice. Tracey McDermott, director of enforcement and financial crime at the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, said Libor-fixing ""cast a shadow over the financial services industry"" and the findings showed individuals having ""a cavalier disregard"" for regulation and the interests of markets. She said ICAP's failings in ""culture and controls"" allowed the misconduct to flourish. In July this year, the British Bankers' Association (BBA), which collates and publishes Libor changed how the rate is set, as a precaution against any repeat of the scandal. The BBA said publication of banks' individual submissions would be embargoed for three months to avoid ""manipulation"".",The UK broker ICAP has been fined $87m (£54m) for its part in the long-running Libor interest rate fixing scandal.
"In interviews with investigators, Tom Hayes said brokers in other firms were a ""tool"" in his ""armoury"", Southwark Crown Court heard. ""It was too widespread and open for people to be completely unaware... It was just so blatant,"" he had said. Mr Hayes, 35, from Fleet, Hampshire, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, denies eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. He also told the investigators from the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) that UBS bosses attended at least one morning meeting in Tokyo, where he was based. The court heard that at the meetings, traders commonly discussed Libor rates, and discussed wanting them set to flatter trading positions. 'Dishonest environment' Mr Hayes told the SFO he was making extra payments to brokers and his network of friends at other banks, in return for information and help. In one extract read out in court, Mr Hayes said: ""Yes I admit I was dishonest and was dishonest within an environment that was prevalent among all the banks."" Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate - is an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth trillions of pounds. Mr Hayes's trading activities were based around movements in the Libor rate. The allegations concern the period 2006 to 2010. The court was told of a co-operation agreement signed by Mr Hayes in April 2013 which could have seen him appear as a witness in the prosecution of other suspects in return for a possible reduced sentence. He was charged in June 2013 and four months later, after he appointed a new legal team, the SFO was informed he was withdrawing from the SOCPA process and would plead not guilty. The trial continues.","A former trader accused of Libor rate rigging said market abuse had been rife, a jury has been told."
"By Simon BrowningBusiness reporter I watched her marry Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) in 1988, alongside 20 million others. I dread to think how many times I watched it on VHS. But looking back, it was early evidence that I, alongside the British public, had already taken Kylie to my heart and that she had real marketing appeal. More than three decades later, public affection for our adopted ""pop princess"" shows no sign of wavering after Sunday's storming set on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage. After appearing on stage to a blaze of Pride colours and mirrors - even Kylie seemed overwhelmed by the size of the crowd that had come to watch. ""I've never seen a crowd like it. Ever. Everybody loves Kylie. You could feel it,"" BBC Music presenter Lauren Laverne said after Kylie came off stage. It's exactly how I felt when I met Kylie last year when I was working at BBC Breakfast. She was as nice in real life as she appears on stage: kind, accepting and smiling. But it takes more than niceness to achieve a music career that spans 30 years, an incredible feat when pop music can be transient and fleeting for many musicians. To date, there have been; How has she done it? Building a career with such longevity is about more than just pop music, it is also about being a shrewd and clever businesswoman who is able to constantly reinvent herself. Kylie's career has seen many guises from squeaky teenage soap star, to a pop hit machine with Stock Aitken and Waterman (I Should Be So Lucky, Hand on Your Heart, Better the Devil You Know), to ""indie Kylie"" (Confide in Me, Where The Wild Roses Grow) and into ""disco Kylie"" (Spinning Around, Love at First Sight, Can't Get You out of My Head). The Glastonbury appearance was just her latest reinvention. It hasn't been easy the whole time. There has been music that didn't resonate with the wider public outside her fan base and periods when Kylie was simply not cool. ""She was unfashionable after Stock, Aitken and Waterman and at times it seemed like she was trying to find herself,"" says Jo Elvin, editor of You Magazine. ""But she has real resilience. That's what people like. It took her a while to realise that being a pop princess was cool. When she accepted that, it's when her own confidence evolved and everyone said 'we love Kylie' and she became a national treasure."" The Glastonbury performance was partly about Kylie making sure she stays relevant, says Amy Thomson, a music artist manager and part of the Grammy Recording Academy. ""It was a triumph - but it was also about her reinvesting in her future. People are talking about her again today. Brands will be talking about her again. Businesses will want to talk to her."" Unpromising beginnings But while I have always been a fan since her early days (my first seven-inch single bought from my local Asda was 'Locomotion'!) not everyone was convinced. ""If you looked at the start of her career, on paper, it looked short-lived,"" says Eamonn Forde, a music business journalist. He says her being picked up by Parlophone, alongside Coldplay, at the end of the 90s sparked a huge change in how seriously she was taken. By the dawn of the millennium Kylie reinvented herself again, with Spinning Around and her biggest single ever - Can't Get You Out of My Head. It's a reinvention that was well received when I witnessed her play at Privilege nightclub in Ibiza wearing those legendary gold hotpants. ""We loved it"". But Mr Forde says these tunes were not just ""throw-away pop songs"" but the start of a new performance era. ""It began a very clever, well thought out progression and the start of huge shows that were and still are an incredible spectacle."" For a majority of artists now, these shows are the main money-spinner out of everything they do. People come to these shows and pay good money for their tickets, to see a performer - and that's what you get with Kylie. I should know, it's the reason I keep going back. I think I'm at 12 shows now. ""As much art is involved in writing songs as there is in performing them. Kylie might not write them all. But a great performer can take a great song somewhere else. People buy into that. And they buy into her,"" adds Mr Forde. Being a pop star is also about looking good, something that Ms Elvin acknowledges Kylie has done - and continues to do very well. But Ms Elvin says it is Kylie's professional approach to work which has really made her stand out. ""Kylie understands she is the pop person there to do her bit. She understands it's business. There are no big pop star dramas."" There are no reliable statistics, but being a pop star has obviously brought Kylie substantial riches. Music releases and arena tours have helped her amass sizeable wealth. But her brand power is also a big part of her income. She has partnerships with opticians chain Specsavers and her own range of bedding, and has also done very lucrative private appearances for families and businesses in the Middle East. Power secret How broad the Kylie brand stretches was apparent in the crowd watching her performance at Glastonbury. It was a complete cross-section of the population. Yes, the LGBT community, which believes it has adopted her, was there in force, but so were parents, children, guys and gals singing in the sunshine. ""In a music genre all about youth, she's there and taking every audience with her all at once"", adds Mr Forde. ""She's not afraid to talk honestly and openly and just be genuinely herself. That's her power.""",Thirty-three years ago. That's when Kylie Minogue first entered my life - and that of millions of teenagers - in the Australian soap Neighbours. It's hard to believe it's that long ago.
"By Faisal IslamEconomics editor US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told the BBC he was hopeful for a deal that could see punitive tariffs on Scottish whisky lowered. The UK recently said it would drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms. This was in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In his first international interview, Mr Lighthizer suggested the UK would need to go further than last week's announcement breaking with the EU's support of European plane maker Airbus. ""I'm talking to [International Trade Secretary] Liz Truss, about trying to work out some kind of a deal... I'm hopeful we can get some kind of an agreement out you know, we don't have a lot of time left,"" he said. ""We have the advantage in that both the US and the UK - particularly the current government of the UK - are not big subsidisers, where some other countries are more inclined to subsidise. So it would be helpful if we could come to some kind of agreement,"" he said when asked about lowering tariffs on whisky and cashmere. ""We are in discussions, we'll see how that works out."" Last week, the UK unilaterally broke with European support of Airbus in a long-running transatlantic trade dispute, changing policy expressed only in January this year of ongoing support even after Brexit, by announcing it would no longer apply tariffs to imports of Boeing aircraft. Liz Truss said that she wanted to ""de-escalate"" the 16-year-old conflict over subsidies. The Airbus-Boeing tariff row However, the BBC understands that in a phone call, the USTR told the trade secretary directly that the US would not treat this as a concession, because, outside of the EU, the UK had ""no authority"" to continue to apply retaliatory measures on the US. ""For sure, it's true that the UK as an individual was not a party to that Airbus-Boeing litigation, right,"" said Mr Lighthizer. ""We brought an action against the EU, France, Germany and the UK. The EU just brought one against us, the member states did not in all cases. so there's no question that as a legal point, that is correct,"" he added. Instead, the US wants the UK to make concessions on the separate EU dispute over steel and aluminium, where US bourbon was among products upon which European tariffs were levied. The talks are part of a general move by President Trump's trade team to wrap up the Boeing-Airbus dispute with the EU, and the UK separately, outside the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The US' top trade negotiator also explained why, despite high hopes even this year for a full US-UK free trade agreement, the next administration had a ""short period"" now in the first half of 2021 to try to wrap up a deal. While he said it was ""extremely likely"" that a full deal would be struck ""before long"", he emphasised that ""tough compromises have to be made"" on agricultural issues, for example. 'Each side has to get something out of it' Asked about demands to adapt UK food standards on beef and chicken, as well as reforms to the way the NHS pays for US medicines, Mr Lighthizer said: ""These negotiations are ongoing. ""You know, clearly, the US needs to get additional access to the agricultural market in the UK - that's an important part of it, each side has to get something out of it. These are complicated technical issues. And they're the kinds of things that will be worked out, I think, in the in the final stages of negotiation."" He also indicated that the US team were never convinced that the UK was actually going fully to depart from EU trade rules, because of the sheer amount of UK-EU trade, despite that being the stated policy of the current government. ""The Brexit situation was always something that was on our mind, if you think about it,"" he stressed. ""The nature of our relationship is going to be affected by the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK, right. They're a much bigger trading partner to you than we are, so that has an impact... I've always had the view that there's just an awful lot of trade between the UK and the EU and it was hard to see there weren't going to be any rules to that."" Mr Lighthizer made it clear that giving the US ""new access"" to UK markets was important, but would be ""less significant"" should the same deal be offered by the UK to another country. ""But, you know, that'll be sorted out here probably in the next two or three weeks or so... one way or another. And then I think there's no reason why the US and the UK can't get to a deal fairly expeditiously after that,"" he added. Mr Lighthizer confirmed that the Trump administration was still planning to hit back against countries levying digital services tax hitting big US tech firms ""unfairly"". He also defended the actions of the current administration in ripping up decades of multilateral action in building a global trade system. However, he said he had no regrets and had helped ""reorient the global trading system"" to help ordinary American workers rather than large corporations.","The outgoing US administration is in talks with the UK to try to seal a mini-deal to reduce trade tariffs, Donald Trump's trade chief has said."
"By Cindy SuiBBC Taiwan correspondent US President Donald Trump launched the trade dispute by threatening to impose tens of billions of dollars of new tariffs on Chinese imports unless China cuts its tariffs, imports more American products, and gives US companies easier access to the Chinese market. Beijing has fired back with threats to impose billions of dollars of tariffs on US products. Our Taipei correspondent Cindy Sui, who grew up in both China and the US, explores the Chinese psyche when it comes to trade, and how history has influenced this mindset. She offers clues as to how Washington and Beijing can learn to be better trade partners with each other: Since 1783 when the American Revolutionary War ended, freeing American trade from British control, Americans have been trying to make their fortune in the Chinese market. Even back then, China hesitated to open its doors to outside trade, preferring to be self-sufficient instead. It put up restrictions, such as insisting on accepting only silver as payment, and confining China's trade with the West to an area of Guangzhou city, near Hong Kong, called The Thirteen Factories. And even back then, US traders struggled to find products that China wanted to buy. They sold mostly ginseng and fur to the Chinese, and instead made more money selling China's products to American consumers. China has come a long way since then - it is now the world's biggest trading nation. It exports more than any country, and its imports are second only to the US. But the desire to be self-reliant remains very strong, which partly explains why it imposes high tariffs on foreign products, restricts foreign companies' market access, tries to learn to make the products they sell by forcing them to transfer technology, and turns a blind eye on intellectual property rights violations by its companies. History helps explain this mentality. Still on Chinese people's minds is the period when China was forced to open up to trading with Western countries. In the 19th Century, European nations used military power to pry open China's market. To earn hard currency from China, the British and Americans even smuggled opium into China and basically drugged its people. Japan meanwhile forced China to sign unequal treaties that allowed foreigners to establish autonomous economic bases in the country. Previous centuries of being taken advantage of, and recent decades of being mired in communist economic standstill, have instilled in the Chinese the sense - even to this day - that China is vulnerable, in need of protecting itself and catching up with stronger nations. Given its history and its mindset, it is no wonder that to China and many Chinese people, trade was never about fair play. To them, it is practically their right to have a huge trade surplus with the US. Also fuelling this is the traditional Chinese belief that the shrewdest business person deserves the best deal or outcome. People who have visited China would have experienced a microcosm of this mentality while shopping. At many street-side markets, including the famous Silk Market in Beijing, prices are not posted. Instead, shoppers and vendors play a game of each trying to get the best deal for himself or herself. The vendors pre-empt the shoppers by asking for a much higher price than their bottom line. The shoppers, at least those who are experienced, ask for a much lower price than what they're willing to pay. A lot of back and forth haggling then takes place, which may include the vendor pretending to be upset at the shopper's low asking price, and the shopper pretending to walk away to another stall. But the vendor almost always calls back the shopper, albeit with feigned disapproval. It's just an act, the vendor would never sell the product at a loss, and is simply making the customer think he or she is getting a good deal. If all goes well, and it usually does, both sides laugh and behave like the best of friends because they've met each other halfway and both have gotten what they wanted. I used to dislike shopping this way, considering it too laborious, and thinking I was being cheated. I even made the mistake of getting upset at the vendors asking for an unreasonable price. But I later learned that I got better deals by smiling and playing along. That's something that has been missing in China-US trade over the years. In their eagerness to make money from each other, the Chinese and Americans have forgotten to make each other feel that they are getting a good deal. China should remind the US that its companies have profited immensely by manufacturing their products cheaply in China, not to mention polluting its environment, and that when the US has what China wants - such as Boeing airliners, China buys a lot of them. Beijing could do well by also reminding America that heavy spending American consumers have benefitted from the cheaper goods imported from China. The US, at the same time, needs to remind China that it's benefited tremendously from relatively low US tariffs, and a level playing field in the US. And that despite historical wrongs done by Western powers to the Middle Kingdom, China is no longer a victim, and it needs to practice fair play as a major trading nation. But it will be an uphill battle. That's because while the Americans may feel cheated, the Chinese feel much worse. Many truly think, be it true or not, that America is out to contain China or even destroy it. As the trade spat brewed, I received an opinion piece circulated on Wechat, the social media portal widely used in China. It accused Trump and the US of acting out of fear of China's rise, and trying to impose tariffs on China's technology exports such as aircraft parts, to kill its high-tech development. ""This is really strange,"" it said. ""So China should only build houses, make clothes, and lend money to the United States? It cannot develop computers, aircraft, and weapons technology? What **** logic is that!"" The article then accused the US of wanting to ""repeat the plundering of the Opium War."" To Westerners, this might seem odd, but one must not forget history is still fresh on Chinese people's minds, and such deep family- and country-destroying wounds do not heal easily. The editorial even expressed the fear in the back of Chinese minds that the US wants to split up China into many small countries (like the former Soviet Union) to weaken it. ""Facts have once again educated the Chinese people that the US imperialists' wishes of killing China still exist,"" it said. ""We must not be in an illusion about this world-class evil empire."" Needless to say, it will take a lot of time, effort and wisdom to bring the two sides closer to understanding and trusting each other. But President Trump seems to understand how to negotiate with the Chinese. Just when the trade spat looked like it could turn ugly, after Trump called for imposing $100bn (£74bn) in new tariffs on Chinese products, he tweeted that he and President Xi will always be friends, no matter what happens with their dispute on trade. Ahead of this week's US-China trade talks in Beijing that was a wise move. It assures China that things won't get ugly, and that it's not personal. One good that may come out of this trade dispute is that the world's second-largest economy may finally realize it has risen up - it is no longer powerless and taken advantage of. It has benefited immensely from other countries' openness towards trade and as its companies expand globally, China needs to play fair in order for its companies to get fair treatment abroad. That's perhaps what has led Chinese President Xi, at the recent Boao Forum on economic development and on the 40th anniversary of the opening up of China's economy, to pledge that China will increase imports, lower import tariffs, increase market access and further protect intellectual property rights. In his speech, President Xi said: ""China will enter a new phase of opening up."" It remains to be seen whether President Xi will carry out his promises. But there's no need for the US to be too anxious. Unlike during the Qing and earlier dynasties, when the Chinese found little need to trade with the outside world, it is now trading widely around the globe. And with its emerging middle class and their growing income, it will have a growing appetite for Western products, especially those that are considered the best in their league. So if the US continues to innovate great products and if the Trump administration bargains well with the Chinese, trade between the two sides will eventually become more balanced, and the two trading partners could even behave like the best of friends.","The world's two largest economies, the US and China, are in the midst of a trade spat that threatens to erupt into a full-scale trade war."
"""Most cakes that I grew up with - the more colourful they were, the fancier they were, the more dolls and butterflies and whatever on it - would signal to you that it was a great cake."" ""More often than not, I was disappointed because there wasn't really any very good chocolate taste. It'd be chocolate flavouring or some synthetic tasting thing,"" recalls Lyn. Lyn's disappointment with the cakes on offer and her own dissatisfaction with her job inspired her to try something new. ""I said I have to create something I'm looking for and - having lived my whole life here in this very cosmopolitan city - I can't believe that I can't find a simple dark chocolate cake that I can just eat whenever I want to and not feel sick."" Trial and error She soon found that she wasn't the only one excited by entrepreneurship and keen to avoid the 9-5 treadmill. ""We had a small group of really good friends…We would sit down on weekends and we would yak about our bosses and our jobs and what we liked and we didn't like, and we always had crazy ideas on what we would do if we did our own business,"" she remembers. ""There were a few ideas that got tossed out the window… So chocolate it was because I said I don't know anything about business guys, but I eat a lot of chocolate."" It proved to be the start of a collaborative, if not particularly structured, adventure. ""I think we didn't do any market research,"" Lyn muses. Her foray into cake-making was especially experimental. ""We mucked around in the kitchen every weekend for a year until we produced this thing…our methods were trial and error. Nothing scientific…We just tried different techniques, we tried different ingredients and we produced what we thought was a pretty yummy chocolate cake."" Growth When Lyn finally opened her first cake shop in 1998, it was tucked away in a little back street with just one type of chocolate cake on offer. Despite her family's support many believed it was a futile venture. ""Doomed to fail, that's what everyone said. They gave us three months and they said you'll be finished,"" she recalls. But after three months Lyn was ordering vast quantities of cake boxes. She says, ""My supplier was about to faint on the floor because she told me I'd ordered way too much. She said I'd still have stock over after ten years."" Despite the rapid demand, Lyn remained cautious. ""We expanded very slowly and very carefully because in our other jobs we had some experience studying other industries, like the dot com industry, which seemed to just sort of appear…and then it just exploded,"" she explains. ""We basically put into it what we could afford and we were prepared that if it didn't work out we weren't going to be on the streets."" In 2004 she opened her second store using the profits from her first shop. Awfully Chocolate now has 17 franchises across Asia, including in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Lyn is adamant that a flagship store should never act as a restrictive blueprint for a company's expansion. ""The interesting thing about doing a franchise is that you learn so much about the different cities, and then you have that interaction with the franchisee,"" she describes. ""Awfully Chocolate grew in a very unusual way in Singapore, and every city has got its own bit of character, bit of personality, its own quirks, so if you want it to work there you've got to figure out what the local quirks are and see if you can still make the concept fit."" Barriers Lyn says that nurturing entrepreneurship and creativity can be difficult in Singapore. She believes the space needed to start up and the expenses involved can still be insurmountable obstructions. ""When I meet young people and I talk to them I say don't do it blindly because if you fail in this country it is still very, very difficult to pick yourself up again."" She explains: ""The land is so small…The rents are tremendously high. I've heard of entrepreneurs, started a business, didn't really work out and slam bam, the next day they get things plastered on their door and they're hauled to court."" 'Enjoy it' Lyn is keen to help her young staff grow as entrepreneurs in their own right. They helped her to develop Awfully Chocolate's first restaurant, Everything with Fries. She says of the venture: ""They really need to take this on, and they really need to feel that this is their baby and then I want them to fly with it."" She sees her role within the business now as equally being a guide to them. The key advice she gives to her staff and young entrepreneurs is: ""No matter what you do, from what I can see, it's really long hours…You might as well enjoy it."" She adds, ""It's fun to talk about it that it's luck but I actually don't believe in luck…I don't know anyone who got anywhere without hard work."" Yet Lyn is reluctant to describe herself as an entrepreneur. She describes how she was once called 'naive' by someone who told her that business is about expansion and selling products that sell, not just what you like. She remarks, ""That's when I realised that business is not always about making money…. I only did it because I enjoyed it, I love it.""","After failing to find the ultimate chocolate cake, lawyer Lyn Lee decided to leave her profession behind to open up her own cake shop, Awfully Chocolate, in Singapore."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter Senior figures within the bank have told me that the government body responsible for the public's 80% stake, UK Financial Investments, has been approached about exploring a series of small stake sales to kick start the process. The bank believes that the government should sell an initial tranche of shares worth about £5bn to test the market. Although the sale would be at a loss on the amount the government originally paid to bail out the bank, it would automatically boost the share price - RBS believes - as institutional investors would take the prospect of future sales more seriously. Senior figures insist that the core bank, which is profitable, is attractive to the market. They point out that the initial sale of the government's then 40% stake in Lloyds Banking Group in 2013 led to a spike in the share price. Over the year, Lloyd's share price rose by 65%. The sale also had the not unwelcome effect of raising £3.2bn for the Treasury's coffers. The government bailed out RBS in 2008 at around 500p a share. That price dropped to an average 407p over subsequent weeks - a price the Treasury could argue is ""break even"". RBS also paid billions of pounds in fees to the government for a continuing insurance facility. Today, RBS shares are trading around 340p, a figure little changed from six months ago. I asked one senior figure intimately involved in the discussions when RBS would like to see the stake sale commence and he answered, only half in jest: ""Tomorrow."" The source said that UKFI was very sympathetic to a sale, as it understood that a bank outside direct political control was likely to perform more strongly. ""Shareholders dislike the present arrangement, clients dislike it and I'm sure ultimately the government dislikes it,"" the source said. ""This arrangement was never supposed to last this long. As an enduring model, it is very tough to make it work. ""The question is, is it acceptable to sell initially at a loss? Well, that is the economic reality. ""You don't need to make your money back on all the tranches. If you did 10 tranches, do you have to make a profit on every one? Any sensible investor would say the important thing is, make money over the whole process."" RBS is now working on giving investors confidence that remaining risks in the bank are understood and accounted for. The first area of concern is litigation costs, the billions of pounds of misconduct payments still working their way through the system. These include legal actions connected to the financial crisis rights issue, legal actions by the US mortgage providers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over the manipulation of the interbank lending rate and costs associated with allegations concerning the foreign exchange market. RBS sources point out that both Barclays and Deutsche Bank raised capital, despite concerns over possible misconduct fines. The second issue is RBS's own capital position. That will be helped by two events - the sale of RBS's American retail bank, Citizens, and the Bank of England's own stress tests. Both are likely to be completed by the end of the year. The sale of Citizens will mean that RBS can repatriate capital held in America back to the UK. RBS believes that the Citizen's sale could improve the bank's key Tier 1 capital position by two and a half percentage points to 12%. Will a stake sale happen this side of a general election? The government has certainly sent out very negative signals on that, saying in January that it was ""not part of any timetable"". The Liberal Democrats are also looking at putting a mass RBS share giveaway in their manifesto, an idea that has been backed by Nick Clegg. RBS will certainly have an up-hill battle convincing politicians that a sale is a good pre-election idea. Sir Philip Hampton, the chairman, made an attempt to get the idea off the ground last year, but has made little progress since. George Osborne would probably like a ""period of silence"" about banks - a story that dos not often play well for the government. Vince Cable has suggested any sale could be five years away. But RBS will keep plugging away, as their latest efforts reveal. Politicians, as we know, are not always noted for their consistency.","After six years and a myriad of rows and mis-steps, RBS is to make a fresh push for a return of the bank to private ownership."
"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News But 12 months on from Royal Mail's flotation on the London stock market, questions over the rights and wrongs have not gone away. What's more, instead of resolving issues over Royal Mail's future, the sale has underlined the company's challenges - most notably from competitors such as TNT, UPS and UK Mail. Yet, for Shore Capital analyst Robin Speakman, the flotation must go down as a success. Remember the climate, he says: political angst, union sabre-rattling, problems in the financial markets. And now? ""The business is stable, the share price still trades at a premium, industrial relations is not an issue, the business is generating cash and has paid its first dividend."" There are problems ahead, he says, ""but the first year has been an achievement."" A lot of people made a lot of money - especially professional investors - if they sold their shares in the early months after the flotation. There's less money to be made now, however. The shares were priced at 330p and surged by more than a third to 455p on their first day, eventually reaching a high of 616p in January. But at the end of September, Royal Mail shares fell below 400p for the first time since they started trading. Toe in the water Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, says that after a rollercoaster few months the share price is now settling at a sensible level that reflects Royal Mail's trading prospects. ""Much as I hate to defend politicians, and particularly [Business Secretary] Vince Cable, he was right in saying that there was an awful lot of froth in the share price in the months after the initial public offering,"" Mr Hewson says. But he feels that the ""euphoria"" around the float had an important by-product - bringing small investors back into the market after getting their fingers burned during the global financial meltdown. ""It re-invigorated private sector involvement in the stock market. People were dipping their toes back in the water. And that is a good, healthy thing for a properly functioning market,"" Mr Hewson says. ""The culture of investing had been seriously damaged by the events of 2007 and 2008."" However, despite the share price fall, the union leaders who opposed the sell-off have seen nothing since to dissuade them that the taxpayer was short-changed. For Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union (CWU), the falling share price is irrelevant. He says: ""After the sale, the price soared. Vince Cable could have got more for the taxpayer. ""The flotation was a disaster. The fact is, it was over-subscribed, and notwithstanding the recent fall in the share price, Cable lost £1bn on the way to the stock market."" Royal Mail in numbers Mr Hayes points to the subsequent post-mortem into the sale process, and into how future governments handle privatisations. ""Cable cannot say that the privatisation was good - and then hold an inquiry into it."" 'Flipping' Mr Hayes and Mr Hewson may come from different ends of the corporate spectrum. But they agree that the role played by some key institutional investors discredited the flotation process. Core investors were allocated shares on the understanding that there would be no immediate profit-taking, or ""flipping"". It didn't turn out that way. ""The flipping didn't look good,"" says Mr Hewson. ""Not locking in these investors was not the wisest thing to do."" But it cannot alone be blamed for the initial surge in the share price, he says. Royal Mail's sale was at a time when some investors were awash with cash. With interest rates low and good returns on assets hard to find, there was plenty of money looking for a home. ""Royal Mail was a victim of this,"" Mr Hewson says. ""And I don't think that politicians understood that."" The main aims of the privatisation, according to Mr Cable, were to free Royal Mail to become a commercial entity while also meeting its legal duty to provide the Universal Service Obligation (to deliver mail everywhere at a standard price). Mr Hewson has yet to see much sign of Royal Mail's newfound competitive nimbleness, although he accepts that it is probably too early in the company's free market history. (Royal Mail did not respond to requests for an interview.) Mr Hayes says there remains a lot of ""discontent"" on the shopfloor. Staff ""are under pressure as the workflow changes"". But the union is still ""taking stock"" of the impact of the privatisation, he says. Another way of reading that is: nothing has yet happened to worsen industrial relations. 'Handcuffs' Of more immediate concern to people is the future of the Universal Service Obligation (USO). While Royal Mail's competitors are able to cherry-pick the most profitable delivery areas - mainly big cities - the company has to provide a universal service. Now, MPs have agreed to look into the matter. For Mr Speakman, the USO issue must be resolved soon. ""We have to decide as a country whether to abandon single pricing and the Universal Service Obligation, or put handcuffs on the competition. The politicians must make this choice."" It doesn't help that Royal Mail staff still enjoy relatively good pay and pensions, while some competitors can chip away at its market using staff on the minimum wage and zero-hours contracts. But even if the status quo continues, most City experts are optimistic about Royal Mail's long-term prospects. The competitive threat, poor trading over the key Christmas period, and contraction in the European business are all problems on the horizon. It is well known that the letters and parcels businesses have been under pressure for years. Yet, as Mr Speakman points out, if it's all so bad, why are so many competitors trying to muscle into the market so aggressively?",For 30 years politicians toyed with the idea of privatising Royal Mail. This time last year the government finally managed it.
"By Chloe HaywardBusiness reporter, BBC News But for tens of thousands of people, this struggle to pay healthcare bills could have been avoided. The NHS has a little-known funding programme called NHS Continuing Healthcare which means those people with a complex ongoing illness can apply for an assessment. For those found to be eligible, all care needs - including nursing home costs of up to £40,000 a year - are met by the NHS. There is no ceiling on the amount that can be paid out, it is not means-tested and the funds are potentially available to anyone over the age of 18. Care can also be provided in a private home or a nursing home. Low uptake At present, 59,000 people are receiving this funding from the NHS but estimates from lawyers and charities suggest that 150,000 people are eligible. The shortfall can be explained, according to solicitors, by a lack of awareness that the programme exists. ""I think the NHS is to blame for not making it clear what options are available,"" says Andrew Farley, a solicitor at law firm Farley Dwek. ""Everyone who is discharged from hospital into a long-term care setting should be assessed for this funding but often people aren't told about it, or if they are, they are told 'Oh, your relative won't be eligible for this'. This is wrong."" Delays in the process are also preventing people from benefitting from this funding pot, it is claimed. In theory, a patient should know whether they are eligible within 44 days of first applying for an assessment. However, some wait for several months, or even more than a year, for a final decision. Families face care bills while they wait for the result. Assessment process explained: To be eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare funding, the patient must be assessed as having a ""primary health need"" and a ""complex medical condition with substantial and ongoing care needs"". In theory, assessments for this funding pot should be given to people when they are discharged from hospital if they face continuing health related care expenses. An assessment can be requested from the programme co-ordinator at a local clinical commissioning groups. A GP should be able to provide contact details. The initial assessment consists of a checklist, which can be completed by a nurse or doctor. Depending on the outcome of the checklist, the patient will either be referred for a full assessment or told they are not eligible. The full assessment is carried out by a team of professionals. During the process 11 key areas are considered - including continence, cognition and mobility. Each area is graded from ""priority"" and ""severe"" through to ""low"". A points system determines the final decision on whether the patient is eligible for funding. The NHS website clearly states that not everyone with a long-term illness will be eligible. Eligibility There are also claims that the qualifying criteria - as set out by the NHS National Framework - are being interpreted incorrectly. The dividing line between who qualifies and who does not is a key issue for many people. Chris Andrews's father, Bill, was assessed and denied funding just a few months before he died. ""The programme is obviously not going to pay out to everyone involved because the government couldn't afford to do that,"" says Mr Andrews. ""I think there are cases where people are in extremely poor health and they need to be funded. ""My late father was blind, immobilised, and doubly incontinent. Still, when he had a continuing care assessment he was borderline and didn't qualify. How ill do you have to be to qualify? ""The assessment criteria are so stringent right now. It is not fair. For my parents, who both worked hard and paid their taxes, they get to the end of their life and hope to reap what they have sown and instead they have to give it all back to pay for care."" Mr Andrews is now one of hundreds of people trying retrospectively to claim back care costs from the NHS. He says he has spent £243,000 on care for his parents so far. His mother is still alive and trying to cope with the final stages of Alzheimer's. Her last assessment concluded that she was still not eligible for funding. The NHS says that 131,000 assessments were carried out last year. An NHS awareness programme is also being launched in January to help people know what funding options are available to them. 'Postcode lottery' The charity Age UK says it is crucial for applicants to be prepared before an assessment takes place, to improve chance of qualifying for funding. ""When you go through the eligibility process they will be asking for evidence as to what the level of need is - how intense it is, how will it change, how uneven they are such as deteriorating one day and being better the next,"" says Tom Gentry, from Age UK. ""Keep a record of those kinds of accounts and so you can give it to the team making the assessment."" A report by consumer group Which? says one of the reasons why people fail to qualify is because different clinical commissioning groups within the NHS are drawing different conclusions on who is eligible. In Salford, 144.6 people per 50,000 receive care funding versus just 11.4 in South Reading. Health standards and funding distribution may vary in each region but many believe these numbers suggest there are other stark variations in how people are assessed. A spokesman for the NHS says they are addressing these issues. ""NHS England is currently undertaking work to establish what progress has been made by local NHS commissioners with regards to requests for an assessment of eligibility for NHS Continuing Healthcare, including for a previously unassessed period of care,"" he says.","More than one million people in the UK have sold their homes to pay for care for themselves or loved ones, according to a report by insurer NFU Mutual."
"Jeffrey Skilling presided over Enron when it became embroiled in one of the biggest corporate frauds in US history. In return for the more lenient sentence, Skilling, who has been in prison since 2006, has agreed to stop appealing against his conviction. Thousands of workers lost their jobs and retirement savings when energy firm Enron collapsed in 2001. The company's implosion came amid revelations executives had covered up the shoddy state of its finances with accounting trickery and shady business deals. The agreement between Skilling and federal prosecutors also allows more than $40m (£26m) seized from him to be distributed to the victims of the Enron fraud. His prison term is now set to expire in December 2020. He was able to push for a sentence reduction after an appeals court ruled in 2009 that a sentencing guideline had not been correctly applied in the original trial. Corporate collapse Jeffrey Skilling worked for Enron for 20 years and was chief executive for just six months, leaving the company four months before bankruptcy. A jury in Houston, Texas convicted him in May 2006 on 19 counts of securities fraud, conspiracy, insider trading and lying to auditors. The jury also found his predecessor as chief executive, Kenneth Lay, guilty of fraud and conspiracy. Lay died in July 2006 of a heart attack. Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, testified against both Skilling and Lay and was sentenced to six years in prison. He was released in December 2011. He declined to comment on Skilling's re-sentencing. Enron was part of a series of corporate accounting scandals at the turn of the century that led directly to a raft of reforms, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.",The prison sentence for the former boss of scandal-hit Enron has been reduced on appeal from 24 to 14 years.
"By Regan MorrisBBC News, Los Angeles Julia Roberts played her in the Hollywood version of her life's work. Now Erin Brockovich is working to raise awareness about what she considers a dangerous method of permanent birth control - Essure. Essure is a quick, non-surgical, permanent method of sterilising women. The procedure involves inserting tiny coils into the fallopian tubes to block sperm from reaching eggs. It has been hailed as an affordable, less invasive method of permanent birth control; an alternative to surgical procedures that block, cut or seal the fallopian tubes. But Ms Brockovich has joined a growing chorus of women questioning the procedure, saying the product has injured thousands of women. ""It's perforating uteruses; it's perforating colons; it's perforating the lining of the stomach,"" Ms Brockovich tells the BBC. ""Some women have whole body scans - they don't know where it is, because it's just floating free in the body. ""One woman had the procedure and she ended up getting pregnant. She couldn't have [the coil] removed and in the 25th week of the pregnancy it broke and migrated, perforating the amniotic fluid. ""The child didn't make it."" 'Science key' Bayer, which makes the product, says it empathises with any woman suffering, but argues that science and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) data proves its product is overwhelmingly safe. ""There are a lot of emotions involved,"" says Bayer's US medical director, Dr Edio Zampaglione. ""The science needs to guide our understanding. Science points to the fact that Essure is a safe and effective product."" Bayer says 750,000 women have had the procedure worldwide, most with no complaint. The FDA says that Essure is the only sterilisation choice available in the US that does not require a skin incision and that the procedure is 99.83% effective when used correctly. Most women who have the procedure can go home 45 minutes later and return to normal activity within one to two days, according to the FDA. The procedure is not reversible. The method was approved in the US in November 2002. From then until 25 October 2013, the FDA says it received 943 reports of adverse events related to Essure, mainly for pain (606 of the complaints). About 1,000 more complaints have been sent to the FDA in a voluntary reporting system. Doctors are not obliged to report complaints, and many women say they did not know how to report problems. A Facebook group called Essure Problems has 8,592 members who call the method ""E-hell"" and mostly complain about pain, bleeding and bloating from the device. Some say they've had coils break and perforate their internal organs. 'Discrimination' Kim Myers had the device implanted in 2008 and says the pain was debilitating for three years until she had a hysterectomy and the Essure hardware removed. The pain wreaked havoc on her marriage and stopped her from riding horses competitively. ""I have never in my life felt discriminated against like I have with this whole thing with Essure,"" Ms Myers says, adding that she felt her doctor pressured her to have it installed. When she complained about the pain, ""he told me, 'you're a silly little woman, you're hormonal.' That's the furthest thing from the truth."" The women cannot sue Bayer because of ""pre-emption"" laws that protect makers of medical devices from class-action lawsuits. Pre-emption means US federal law pre-empts lawsuits based on state law claims, such as negligence or failure to warn. The laws were intended to stop frivolous lawsuits, but consumer rights advocates like Ms Brockovich say the laws need to be amended. ""We need to hold companies accountable and in this situation Bayer can't just turn their head and go 'these 8,000 women don't matter'. I think that they have a responsibility, a duty, to take a look and, if there's a question, pull it,"" Ms Brockovich says. ""One's too many. Eight thousand women? You cannot disregard that voice collectively. There is something wrong with the product."" Ms Brockovich urges women to share their stories and to put pressure on Bayer to remove Essure from the market. And she knows what it is like to take on big corporate interests - she was instrumental in winning the largest class action lawsuit in US history, despite her lack of a formal legal education. The case was against Pacific Gas and Electric Company of California for contaminated water. 'Disconnect' Bayer says Ms Brockovich's concerns are misguided. Dr Zampaglione of Bayer, which is a well-established brand that is more than 150 years old, says there is no chance of the company removing Essure from the market. ""I can tell you it's a very low percentage [of women reporting adverse effects],"" he says. ""It's consistent with clinical trials and consistent with what the FDA is seeing."" Dr Zampaglione says the company has two free numbers for patient complaints and that they want to hear from any women experiencing problems with Essure. He also says the company would not squander its reputation on a product it did not believe in 100%. ""We are trying to engage with patients, with women who feel they have faced injury and adverse events. I can't comment on Erin's views, but I do see a disconnect - we are in the business of providing quality products and devices.""",She was the single mother who took on corporate America and won.
"Buoyant trading for the first six months of the year led the clothing retailer to raise its profit forecast for the full year by £10m to £727m. Next said the UK retail market remained ""volatile"" and it remained ""cautious"" in its outlook. The Brexit-related risks include higher tariffs on goods imported into the UK. However, queues and delays at UK and EU ports as a result of increased customs declarations for other companies posed the biggest risk. The retailer said it was preparing for the possibility that the UK leaves the EU without a transition period or a free trade agreement in place. However, it downplayed the impact a no-deal outcome would have on its business. Share boost Next's better-than-expected results come in contrast to some of the downbeat news from other High Street retailers, and sent its shares up more than 7% in morning trading. The retailer said full-price sales in the first six months of the year beat expectations, rising by 4.5%. However, the trend of sales moving online and away from High Street stores continued. Sales at its shops fell 6.9% to £925.1m, but online sales jumped 16.8% to £892.3m. As a result total group sales were up 3.8% to £1.98bn and pre-tax profit rose 0.5% to £311.1m. ""When we issued our August Trading Statement we believed that there was a high risk that the sales gained in July would be offset by losses in August. As it turned out, we did not experience any material loss of sales in August or early September,"" said Next chief executive Lord Wolfson. However, he added: ""The UK retail market remains volatile, subject to powerful structural and cyclical changes. As expected, sales in our stores (which now account for just under half of our turnover) continue to be challenging."" 'More agile' Julie Palmer of Begbies Traynor said Next's ""continued success"" owed much to its early entry into catalogue sales with the launch of Next Directory in 1988: ""This was a natural fit with the subsequent rise of online shopping and gave Next a distinct advantage, which they still benefit from 30 years later."" However, she added. many of Next's rivals were ""light years behind"" and would ""continue to struggle"". Next also has a ""more agile"" retail estate with shorter leases and profitable stores, said Sofie Willmott of GlobalData. ""Stores remain a declining part of the business but Next is utilising physical locations to its advantage, for example by adding in concessions to drive revenue and give shoppers other reasons to visit Next, and also as a back-up stock pool for online orders,"" she added. Next said it was ""well advanced"" in its preparations in case neither a transition period nor a free-trade agreement were in place by the time of Brexit next March. But it said the no-deal risks did not pose a ""material threat to the ongoing operations and profitability"" of Next in the UK or EU. Next said in the ""unlikely event"" that free-trade agreements were not put in place, the cost of goods could rise by up to about £20m, which would add less than 0.5% to its prices. The company said it would be ""in the interest"" of both the UK and remaining EU nations that the UK's departure from the EU was ""carefully managed, accompanied by a period of transition and some form of agreement for free trade"". Last year, Lord Wolfson, who voted in favour of Brexit, warned that failing to secure a ""smooth"" departure from the EU could result in ""years of economic decline"" for the UK. Analysis: Emma Simpson, business correspondent The news from Next is certainly a lot brighter than the gloomy headlines from other big names on the High Street. But these figures shouldn't be interpreted as a sign of an improvement in consumer spending. Next is a very well run business which is managing its costs and has been has been far more agile in dealing with the huge structural shift to online sales. Although sales in its physical stores are down, this weakness is being offset with continuing growth online. Just under half of its Next brand sales are now online. Most of its stores remain profitable and the average length of its leases is just over six years. This retailer seems to be navigating the changes better than most of its big rivals.",Next has reported better-than-expected sales following this summer's heatwave but warned of Brexit-related risks to its business.
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York But Covid concerns have cancelled the big gathering for her. So this year the artist is skipping cooking altogether, opting instead for a takeaway Thanksgiving meal. She, her husband, two friends and toddler will be dining on a 10-dish spread prepared by Canlis, a high-end Seattle restaurant with an award-winning chef, who is offering a video tutorial to coach customers through the final steps of turkey roasting. ""It feels like it's been such a year,"" says Serrah, who has relied on Canlis takeaway to mark other special occasions this year. ""It's sort of nice to take away that stress and just be present with people and enjoy that aspect of it."" Thanksgiving takeaways As officials warn against travel and in some places bar gatherings of more than 10 people due to the pandemic, the limits have raised questions about the impact on Thanksgiving, normally one of the biggest holidays in the US and a generator of billions of dollars in travel and food sales. Among poultry producers, the likelihood that smaller gatherings this year could loosen loyalty to the traditional turkey dinner has raised fears of a surplus of the fowl, especially of larger birds. But some restaurants, which have been hammered by social distancing restrictions and a drop in dining out, hope the situation has produced a possible silver lining, as smaller numbers make it more feasible for families to splurge on a professionally prepared meal - even if it ends up being eaten at home. Thanksgiving takeaway packages are popping up at restaurants across the country, as chefs from Michelin-starred establishments to highway standbys like Cracker Barrel look to reinvent themselves for the Covid era. Parachute, a Michelin-starred Korean-American restaurant in Chicago, would typically close on the holiday, enjoying the brief respite from what is one of its busiest months. The restaurant is shut this year too, but families can pick up a Thanksgiving spread the day before, which draws on memories of what owner Beverly Kim's mother cooked for the celebration, with dishes like crab meat gratin and parsley and butter Korean rice. ""We want to make it easy and a way to celebrate,"" Ms Kim says. Ms Kim says a Mother's Day package she offered earlier this year proved a hit, and with business still about 30% down on what it was before the pandemic, she's hoping to build on that success. ""People don't skimp on holidays or on birthdays. They still want to celebrate those major milestones,"" she says. ""Restaurants like mine are banking on that - that people will support us at least with event kits and we can hopefully make it a memorable experience."" 'The world has changed' Less than 10% of Americans typically eat Thanksgiving dinner at a restaurant, according to polls by the National Restaurant Association. But this year, what is usually a quiet day for the industry has already generated millions of dollars in sales, says Bryan Ferschinger, marketing chief at Tock, a restaurant reservation system that has morphed into an online order platform during the pandemic. Roughly 1,000 restaurants - about a fifth of the businesses on the platform - are offering ""Thanksgiving To Go"" menus, with more launching every day, he says. ""The world has changed. Restaurants have gotten creative this year as they strive to make the best of the situation by offering a range of Thanksgiving dinner options for carryout and delivery."" It's too soon to say how sales will compare with last year, but specialty shops and grocery stores have also reported boosting their meal kits and ready-to-eat options, betting that people tired of Covid cooking will seek out convenience - if only for parts of the meal - to celebrate. ""People are just getting burned out of cooking,"" says butcher Jake Dickson, owner of Dickson's Farmstand Meats in New York, which scaled back its order of raw turkeys by 30% but is doing brisk business in ready-made turkey confit legs. ""We wanted delicious things that were celebratory without as much effort."" Fast service At some of the most popular restaurants, Thanksgiving packages have disappeared as fast as reservations did in pre-Covid times. The Liholiho Yacht Club in San Francisco, known for its multicultural fare and the scarcity of its tables, sold out its $200 (£150) four-person Thanksgiving-to-go meal in roughly a week. Chef and co-owner Ravi Kapur says the big appetite for the feast, which includes sausage-stuffed turkey roulade, sticky rice stuffing and confit garlic mashed potatoes, means he's considering Christmas and New Year's kits too. But Mr Kapur, who opened the restaurant in 2015, is not quite celebrating. Since California entered its first lockdown in March, he's slashed his staff from more than 60 to about five. His dining room remains closed and sales this year are at about 20% of what they were, he estimates. ""If there's any way to kind of explore these new revenue streams and have a good time doing it, we will,"" he says. ""But there's a lot more days of the year that we've got to get through. It's by no means an ultimate victory. ""If we were in a hospital, we'd be in critical condition,"" he adds. Since March, about 100,000 restaurants in the US have closed - roughly one in six, according to the National Restaurant Association. Some two million jobs have yet to return. As of September, about 40% of those still in business said they expected to close, unless Washington approved additional aid. The industry's woes were on Lindsey O'Connor's mind as she considered her Thanksgiving options this year. Lindsey, who lives in Minneapolis, may end up dining solo since Covid has made the prospect of travelling home to family or joining friends' celebrations more complicated. But she's still planning a feast - even knowing some of it is destined for the freezer. She's ordered a half-turkey from barbecue food truck Animales BBQ, sweet potato and other sides from Union Hmong Kitchen and turned to the upscale Spoon and Stable restaurant for stuffing and pumpkin chiffon pie. Lindsey plans to make her grandmother's dinner rolls, as she does every year, but the decision to outsource the rest of the cooking was deliberate - a way to make the holiday not only special and less stressful, but also to support the local restaurant scene. ""I feel like I'm in a position with having a steady paycheque to make sure I'm paying it forward and in my mind that means supporting local restaurants,"" says the 31-year-old, who researches retail trends. ""This winter is going to be super difficult,"" she adds. ""I find it in some strange way a way to give back and ensure that other people can have a Thanksgiving meal themselves.""","At this time in November, 34-year-old Serrah Russell would normally be fielding a tonne of text messages as her family plotted out kitchen logistics and contributions for the Thanksgiving feast."
"By Sheetal ParmarBBC Asian Network Like thousands of couples, Londoners Vishal, 25, and Ravika, 24, had to postpone their wedding and reception after the coronavirus pandemic struck. It was meant to be a lavish affair with three separate events and 400 guests. But current measures imposed on weddings and gatherings mean the prospects of a big blowout are slim. The UK wedding industry as a whole has been hit hard by the pandemic, with weddings banned under almost all circumstances since lockdown began. That ban was lifted on 4 July in England, where small weddings with up to 30 guests are now allowed, with other restrictions. There are other rules for Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Vishal and Ravika have cut down their guest list but are still keen to see whether a wedding with more than 30 guests is possible. ""Restrictions are being eased up now, and people might say you can't have a wedding with 400 guests, but you can have 200. That plays a big part in moving and postponing [our wedding]."" So as well as moving their May 2020 wedding to October, they have also pencilled in a date in June 2021 at the same venue, in the hope that by one of those dates they can have 200 or more guests. Big spenders It is estimated the wedding industry in the UK is worth around £10bn, with average spending on a wedding about £27,000. But British Asian weddings, traditionally larger family affairs, with multiple events, tend to cost more. Anisha Vasani from Bridelux, a specialist brand for the luxury wedding industry, estimates that British Asian weddings could account for nearly half of the UK wedding industry. ""The average Asian couple spend between £50,000-£100,000 on their wedding, depending on how many functions they hold for their celebrations, with costs only expected to grow."" Many businesses specialising in supplying the Asian wedding market have suffered during the pandemic. Seema Sarfraz runs Seema Sarees in east London. Her family business has been there since 1985 and bridal outfits are the mainstay of her sales. ""The time that we went into lockdown was one of our biggest periods for bridal orders. In a normal year we would take 400-500 bridal orders, we're talking about £500,000 worth of sales."" With her shop closed during lockdown and her staff furloughed, Seema had more time to focus on social media. She already had a sizeable Instagram following, which had previously brought in sales, but like others, she discovered the power of TikTok and started uploading fashion shoots of models in bridal outfits to Bollywood and hip hop tracks. It wasn't long before an unassuming bridal shoot went viral. ""I woke up in the morning, and I'm like, 'Nine million views, 250,000 followers?' And from then on it's just built and built."" She now has more than a million followers on TikTok. It has resulted in some sales for Seema too, notably from the US and Canada, but she's keen to welcome customers back into her store, albeit while social distancing and wearing face coverings. Suppliers hit Other wedding businesses - those that help make events happen - have also had to stop and take stock of where their livelihoods will come from. Deep Bajwa runs Opulence Events, a luxury wedding and event planning company. ""Last year I had 37 weddings, and this year we managed to get one in before lockdown. ""We deal with larger numbers for the weddings we work on, so for us I can't see it happening [this year]."" Many of Deep's clients are couples and families who spend upwards of £100,000 on their weddings - that includes venues, catering, clothes, entertainment and jewellery. ""We like it big! We like to have an amazing show. It's big money that's spent on Asian weddings."" Deep says the lockdown has had huge implications for other suppliers she works with. ""We've had to postpone everyone's payments until next year. Most people's terms are two to four weeks for the final payment before the event, now if the event itself has moved, the final payments have gone with them."" 'So much we don't know' She, and others in the industry, are unsure of how Asian weddings of this scale will happen in future. Deep mentions caterers having to rethink how they would serve buffets, and trying to figure out how to have a dance floor where you can socially distance yourself from others. ""There's still so much we don't know but we're keeping an eye on all the information, and trying to keep our clients happy and informed."" How will Asian wedding businesses deal with the likelihood of smaller, scaled back weddings in the immediate future? Timmy Kader is the co-founder of 1SWEvents, an event planning and decorating company that counts boxer Amir Khan as one of its clients. She and her team are used to decorating plush venues that can hold hundreds of guests. ""We haven't got any weddings until the end of this year, which are still hanging on the edge because we don't know if there will be a second wave [of coronavirus]."" Nevertheless, she is hopeful for the future. ""People still want an Instagramable wedding and you can have that wedding in your home, providing you get a décor expert in to advise you and still make it look really pretty.""","""We've always pictured having the big fat Indian wedding,"" say Vishal Panesar and his fiancée Ravika Sabh, almost in unison."

"By Katie Prescott Business reporter, BBC News The government is currently deciding whether to cut maximum stakes on Fixed Odds Betting Terminals from £100 to as little as £2 to fight problem gambling. More than half of Ladbrokes' betting shop revenue comes via the machines. Ladbrokes says such a dramatic drop in income means cuts are made elsewhere. Sponsorship Almost £3.5m of the company's sports sponsorship is dedicated to horseracing. This includes the Ladbrokes Winter Carnival (a two day meeting at Newbury), the Coral Scottish and Welsh Grand Nationals, the Coral Cup (Wednesday at Cheltenham), the Coral Eclipse (one of the biggest flat races of the year) and the Coral Sprint at York. It also sponsors the Rugby Football League Challenge Cup and the Scottish Professional Football League as well as snooker and darts. Ladbrokes said: ""A severe stake cut has many implications not least on jobs, the Treasury and the sports we support. ""Sports sponsorship is a two-way street, yes we get exposure but it also helps sports finance their entire structures right down to grass-roots funding."" The company suggested that horse racing was less vulnerable to potential sponsorship cuts than other sports. It said: ""Horse racing is in the bookie DNA and some sponsorships and partnerships go back many years and have a history and association that make them very valuable and high on the list to continue."" William Hill also says that its £1m sponsorship of horse racing could be ""at risk"" if the stake on FOBTs was set too low. Horse racing The possibility of losing sponsorship is yet another headache for horse racing, which fears that anything that hurts high street bookmakers could reduce its funding. Racing Post editor Bruce Millington said: ""No-one likes the fact that the horseracing industry is a hostage to a whole load of high octane fruit machines but there's little question that a £2 limit would have significant implications."" Sponsorship is just one of the ways the sport is funded by bookmakers. A 10% levy on horse racing bets contributes about £50m, which is managed and distributed by the Horserace Levy Betting Board as prize money, to improve and support racecourses and invest in equine veterinary science. This used to come from bets placed in shops, but last year it was expanded to include online and offshore revenue. As a result, it is expected to double this year and the impact of any potential shop closures on it is disputed. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said gambling was one of many ways in which sports obtain fundraising. ""We are clear that FOBT stakes will be cut to ensure we have a safe and sustainable industry where vulnerable people are protected,"" it said in a statement. The department said a final decision on maximum bets will be made ""in due course"". Screen rights A much larger loss of money for horse racing is likely come in the area of media rights. Each betting shop pays about £30,000 a year to the industry to screen their races. If curbing FOBTs leads to a reduction in the number of shops, as the bookmakers say, then that would mean there would be fewer screens and therefore fewer buyers for the events. The chief executive of the largest race course group in the UK, Arena Racing Company, Martin Cruddace, estimates that a £2 maximum stake could lead to a minimum £50m impact on racing. ""The effect on prize money and the economic ecosystem of the industry would be pretty catastrophic,"" he said. ""It would be a sad irony that the great work of the industry and government in extending the levy to online operators last year could be undone (and more) at a stroke.""","The UK's biggest bookmaker, Ladbrokes Coral, says it will have to cut the £8m it spends each year on sponsoring sports events if new rules reduce the maximum stake on gaming machines."
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter If you're surprised, don't be. It's been clear for some time that the Philippines is a nation stuck between the US and China, a proxy, if you will, for the position many Asian countries now find themselves in. While his tour has certainly been about trying to show the region that the US is to some extent still engaged in Asia, it's obvious the American president cares deeply about two issues: North Korea, and trade. And if we're honest, North Korea, is probably his most pressing concern. So how could the Philippines unlock any solutions to what Donald Trump wants from Asia? And what does the Philippines need from the US in return? A brief history: 'Frenemies' forever First, history matters. You've got to know the past, to understand the present. The Philippines and the US have a long and difficult relationship, starting with the Philippine-American war in 1899 that lasted three years. It resulted in thousands of deaths on both sides - but the Filipinos suffered most. The US decision to annex the Philippines was controversial at best. It was partly motivated by the Age of the Empire - countries planting flags wherever they could, colonising other nations to mark as their own. But it was also motivated by America's desire to have a strategic place in the Asia Pacific region - to protect the US mainland from invasion, and to protect its commerce. Sound familiar? Fast forward 100 years and not much has changed. Eventually the US granted the Philippines independence in 1946, but kept its military bases in the archipelago, ostensibly to keep an eye on what was going on in the neighbourhood. Post-independence Philippines has had an on-off-on-again relationship with the US. Protests over what was seen as American imperialism marked the 1980s and 1990s, and the combination of anti-American sentiment as well as a natural disaster in 1991 drove some US bases to Guam and elsewhere in the region after that. Still, the war on terror and Islamic insurgencies in the Southern Philippines and the South China Sea issue have brought the two nations closer together again - with the resurrection of temporary US military bases in the Philippines. But change is afoot in the balance of power China changed the game when it catapulted its way to become the top trading partner for Asian countries, including the Philippines. Beijing is also making inroads into the Philippines with its Belt and Road investments, and has pledged $9bn worth of investment there. And while the Philippines was at one point actively fighting China's claims in the South China Sea - and even took its case to an international tribunal and won - under President Duterte's watch it has basically ""rolled over"", says Carl Thayer, director of Thayer Consultancy in Sydney. ""No one besides Cambodia has gone as far as Duterte has to placate China,"" adds Mr Thayer. So does that mean the US has lost the war for influence in the Philippines - and by proxy, Asia? Not quite, he points out. ""The US helped the Philippines fight the Islamic State in Marawi and that has kept them in the game."" Mr Thayer has also written about how well President Duterte is playing both China and the US against one another to his advantage - a strategy other Asian leaders are likely to use as well. This is where North Korea comes in Cast your mind back to when Donald Trump announced via Twitter that he would stop trading with any country that does business with North Korea. As I wrote at the time, that was an unrealistic move - mainly because it would hurt the US more in the long run. But even stranger, was the reaction of the Philippines. Trade between Manila and North Korea jumped by 170% in 2016. And when that news started making headlines, the Duterte government took measures to rectify this imbalance almost immediately by cutting off trade with North Korea. Why the rush? None of the other countries on that list jumped into action immediately, and it's not like the US was telling Manila to get its house in order. Well, one reason is that the Philippines wanted to make sure it was on the right side of the UN sanctions, and that none of the money Pyongyang was making from Philippine trade, was being ploughed back into the weapons industry. But a more pragmatic reason goes back to trade: the Philippines does at least $8bn worth of trade with the US every year in comparison to the $53m with North Korea, so it's far too much of a risk not to do what the US wants. Still, it was interesting to hear an emotional appeal recently from President Duterte about North Korea's Kim Jong Un: ""If somebody could just reach out, talk to him and say, 'My friend, why don't you just join me in the table and we'll just talk about things?"" It's unlikely President Trump will see things the same way. So there is still common ground One thing the Philippines and the US may well agree on though, is their perspective on matters of human rights. While the Obama administration was critical of President Duterte's war on drugs, in contrast President Trump has said he is going to the Philippines because it is ""a strategically important place"", and a US official has said that the two leaders share a ""warm rapport"". They're often compared to one another, because of their larger than life personalities, and their blunt manner. In return for support on North Korea, President Trump is unlikely to press hard on human rights and extrajudicial killings in the Philippines as his predecessor did - and that will suit President Duterte just fine. So as you can see, the Philippines and the US have a symbiotic relationship. It's not just because the two nations are democracies, historical allies (despite their long and difficult past) and that their two leaders share interesting personality quirks. It's because they are strategically and symbolically wedded to one another, and the Philippines has increasingly become a bellwether for America's position in Asia.","For most Asian leaders, it would be fair to say that Donald Trump is an enigma. But could the key to understanding US objectives in the region lie with an island nation known for its chaotic politics - the Philippines?"
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The company will have 511 branches across the country following the closure programme. Managers said they did not expect to make any redundancies, with staff moved to nearby branches instead. Coronavirus and changing customer habits have altered the way we bank, but there are concerns over closures. Campaigners say that local branches provide a lifeline for those who need access to cash and face-to-face services, and allow small businesses to bank without too much disruption to their own trade. HSBC said all but one of the branches earmarked for closure were within one mile of a Post Office, where these day-to-day transactions could be carried out. 'New direction' It said - even stripping out the effects of the pandemic - the number of customers using branches had fallen by a third in the past five years, and 90% of all customer contact was over the phone, internet or smartphone, in addition to contacts on social media. Jackie Uhi, HSBC UK's head of network, said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic has emphasised the need for the changes that we are making. ""It hasn't pushed us in a different direction but reinforces the things that we were focusing on before and has crystallised our thinking. This is a strategic direction that we need to take to have a branch network fit for the future.""

"In its ruling, the commission said the merger would have harmed consumers, reduced choice and led to increased prices for passengers travelling in and out of Ireland. Aer Lingus welcomed the decision and said ""Ryanair's offer should never have been made"". Ryanair said it would appeal against the judgement. The budget airline, which already owns 30% of Aer Lingus, was given a list of objections by the European Commission in October last year and said it had addressed all of the competition concerns raised. Ryanair's Robin Kiely said: ""The EU Commission has regrettably reversed its own precedents in order to prohibit Ryanair's offer for Aer Lingus. ""Ryanair's radical remedies package clearly addressed all of the concerns raised by the EU both in its 2007 prohibition and in its November 2012 statement of objections. ""Ryanair regrets that the EU Commission has again failed to apply its own competition rules and precedents in a fair and dispassionate manner. ""We regret that this prohibition is manifestly motivated by narrow political interests rather than competition concerns and we believe that we have strong grounds for appealing and overturning this politically-inspired prohibition. ""Accordingly, Ryanair has instructed its legal advisers to prepare a comprehensive appeal against this manifestly unjust prohibition."" The Irish government holds a 25% stake in Aer Lingus and has previously voiced its opposition to Ryanair's bid. Irish transport minister Leo Varadkar said the commission's decision ""supports the government's view that a merger would be bad for competition in the Irish aviation market"". ""Following detailed consideration of the proposal, the government's strongly held view is that a takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have a significant detrimental effect on competition, connectivity and employment in the Irish market,"" the minister said. ""Similar to my own view, the commission considered that the remedies proposed by Ryanair were insufficient to address the competition concerns."" Mr Varadkar said promoting competition among airlines serving the Irish market was at the heart of the government's aviation strategy. ""The continued presence of at least two strong competing airlines serving Ireland's air transport needs is clearly good for competition,"" he said.",The European Commission has blocked a third attempt by Ryanair to take over rival Irish airline Aer Lingus.
"The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) cuts trade tariffs and sets common standards in trade for 12 Pacific rim countries, including the US and Japan. It marks the end of five years of often bitter and tense negotiations. Supporters say it could be worth billions of dollars to the countries involved but critics say it was negotiated in secret and is biased towards corporations. The deal covers about 40% of the world economy and was signed after five days of talks in Atlanta in the US. Despite the success of the negotiations, the deal still has to be ratified by lawmakers in each country. What is the TPP? How did it start? With a trade agreement signed 10 years ago between Brunei, Chile, New Zealand and Singapore. How big is it? Pretty big. The 12 countries have a population of about 800 million and are responsible for 40% of world trade. What are the criticisms? That negotiations have been conducted in secret, and that it favours big corporations. Who benefits most? Japan stands to reap huge economic benefits from the deal, while for the US it is an important strategic move. What happens next? The agreement will need to be ratified by each of the individual member countries. More: What is the TPP and why does it matter? For President Barack Obama, the trade deal is a major victory. He said: ""This partnership levels the playing field for our farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers by eliminating more than 18,000 taxes that various countries put on our products."" But US Senator Bernie Sanders, a US Democratic presidential candidate, said: ""Wall Street and other big corporations have won again."" He said the deal would cost US jobs and hurt consumers and that he would ""do all that I can to defeat this agreement"" in Congress. China left out China was not involved in the agreement, and the Obama administration is hoping it will be forced to accept most of the standards laid down by TPP. He said: ""When more than 95% of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can't let countries like China write the rules of the global economy. ""We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment."" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters the deal was a ""major outcome not just for Japan but also for the future of the Asia-Pacific"" region. Biotech dispute The final round of talks were delayed by negotiations over how long pharmaceutical corporations should be allowed to keep a monopoly period on their drugs. The US wanted 12 years of protection, saying that by guaranteeing revenues over a long period it encouraged companies to invest in new research. Australia, New Zealand and several public health groups argued for five years before allowing cheaper generic or ""copy-cat"" into the market. They said a shorter patent would bring down drug costs for health services and bring lifesaving medicine to poorer patients. Even though a compromise was reached, no definitive protection period was confirmed. Speaking at a press conference following the deal, US Trade Representative Michael Froman hailed the deal as the first to set a period of protection for patents on new drugs, which he said would ""incentivise"" drug producers. But the Washington-based Biotechnology Industry Association said it was ""very disappointed"" by the reports that the agreement fell short of the 12-year protections sought by the US. Tense issues The car industry was another area of intense negotiation with countries agonising over how much of a vehicle had to be manufactured within the TPP countries in order to qualify for duty-free status. Agriculture proved another sticking point with countries like New Zealand wanting more access to markets in Canada, Mexico, Japan and the United States. Canada meanwhile fought to keep access to its domestic dairy and poultry markets strictly limited. The issue and its impact on rural voters is particularly sensitive ahead of the federal election in two weeks time. Asked about potential job losses - a criticism of the deal - Canada's trade minister Ed Fast said: ""We don't anticipate that there will be job losses. Obviously there will be industries that have to adapt."" The agreement was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" for Canada to shape outcomes and rules in the Asia Pacific region, Mr Fast added.",The biggest trade deal in decades was struck on Monday.
"By Katie SilverBBC News The company said it made $37m (£28.7m) profit in the third quarter. Product bugs and unusually low demand over the summer hampered advertising sales. Revenues were 9% higher than the previous year at $824m, but still at the lower end of Wall Street forecasts. The micro-blogging site said revenue had been predicted to fall from the first two quarters, but that unexpected problems had weighed on sales, including bugs which had an impact on its ability to target ads and share data. Twitter has also lowered fourth-quarter revenue predictions. The firm now expects to earn between $940m and $1.02bn in the fourth quarter, down from a previously forecast $1.06bn. The social media platform did boost the number of daily users who see ads on the site, known as monetisable daily active users (mDAU), which reached 145 million, beating analyst estimates for 141 million, up 17% year-on-year. Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said the company was making improvements to the platform's algorithm. ""We also continue to make progress on health, improving our ability to proactively identify and remove abusive content, with more than 50% of the Tweets removed for abusive content in Q3 taken down without a bystander or first-person report,"" he said. This crackdown on abusive behaviour is something analysts say separates Twitter from Facebook, which admitted on Thursday to being unable to confirm if hate speech from political candidates would be taken off the platform. ""Twitter has focused on the core experience for their users instead of politics,"" said Wendy Johansson of digital consultancy Publicis Sapient. ""They're not out fighting a political war like Facebook - they're focused on building the best tech and getting users addicted to the tech."" Anthony Macro, head of social advertising at Croud, said the social media platform's attempts to root out bad activity would appeal to advertisers, but that their record was not flawless. ""It might be even harder to convince more people to join the platform after Twitter admitted in August it may have shared users' data with advertising platforms without consent,"" he said. ""With privacy so top of mind for users, across all social media platforms, it's absolutely critical for Twitter to sort these issues out if they want to make serious headway with future results,"" he added. Mr Macro said the big question for Twitter was whether it could monetise its profile and turn its political influence into advertising revenue.",Twitter shares tumbled 17% in early trading as quarterly profits came in at less than a quarter of what analysts had predicted.
"The loss-making retailer had put forward the plan as part of an attempt to turn its fortunes around. BHS was bought by billionaire Sir Philip Green for £200m in 2000, but he sold it last year for just £1. It is now owned by Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of financiers, lawyers and accountants. The company currently has debts of more than £1.3bn, including a pensions deficit of £571m. Under the agreement, a number of BHS's stores - 47 - will see a hefty rent cut of either 75% or 50%. The best-performing stores, which covers 77 outlets, will continue to pay rent as normal, although rents will be paid monthly rather than quarterly. The remaining 40 stores will continue to trade for a minimum of 10 months while negotiations with landlords are held on reducing rents by 25%. A separate meeting later on Wednesday saw creditors vote to approve a plan involving 23 other BHS stores grouped as BHS Properties Limited. 'Credible plan' Darren Topp, BHS's chief executive, thanked the creditors and said: ""This gives BHS the opportunity to move forward. ""It is a tough time for retailers across the UK with huge structural challenges faced by all, however, we have a very credible plan to return BHS to growth and profitability and a revitalised British Home Stores will emerge as we accelerate our turnaround plans."" The latest agreement also includes a plan to sell the long lease on its flagship Oxford Street store for around £30m. BHS - which has been loss-making for seven years - needed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), otherwise it would have ended up in administration, placing the jobs of its 10,000 workers at risk. Will Wright, restructuring partner at KPMG, who oversaw the CVAs, said: ""Today's 'yes' votes enable BHS to tackle the issue of an unsustainable lease burden which was weighing heavily on the business. ""While together, the two CVAs comprise only one element of BHS's plan to turn around its fortunes, they are a critical cog in the mechanism that will put the business in a stronger operational position. The proposal process has given both the company and its creditors the opportunity to agree a compromise that is mutually acceptable."" Pension hole But even with the landlords' support, BHS has warned that it needs extra funding to trade beyond 25 March and it is trying to raise £100m. A further major problem for the company is its pension deficit. BHS is in talks to address this with the Pension Protection Fund, as well as the Pensions Regulator and the BHS pension trustees. BHS insists that it continues to meet its pension payment obligations. But in BHS's CVA submission, the retailer's directors were clearly hoping that the two pension schemes would be transferred into the PPF and that the company would have no further liability to fund it. Malcolm Weir, head of restructuring and insolvency, at the PPF warned: ""The CVA for BHS has been agreed, however this does not mean the pension schemes' deficits have been resolved. ""The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) will be working with the company over the coming months to find a solution. However failure to reach a compromise may still result in insolvency. Members of the pension schemes continue to be protected."" BHS: A history of a High Street stalwart",Almost all creditors of the troubled store chain BHS have voted to allow a cut in rents for some of its UK stores.
"Carnival, which operates ships under brands such as P&O and Costa Cruises, said full year revenues, which were expected to be flat, would now fall 2-3%. It blamed the drop on a higher-than-expected rise in voyage cancellations. In turn, this weaker demand resulted in downward pressure on ticket prices. ""The company now expects full year 2013 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.65 compared to its previous earnings guidance of $1.80 to $2.10,"" Carnival said in a statement. Panmure Gordon analyst Karl Burns advised investors to sell the shares following the warning, saying cutting ticket prices was unwise. ""Price reductions have not been offset by a high enough increase in volumes,"" he said. ""This bodes ill for the future as we think Carnival will struggle to regain pricing power."" The firm has suffered a series of high profile problems with its ships. The most devastating incident was in 2012, when its Costa Concordia ship ran aground off the coast of Italy. Thirty-two people died in the shipwreck, which an official report blamed on the captain of the Costa Concordia, as well as assigning some responsibility to Costa Cruises. More recently, Carnival chief executive Gerry Cahill was forced to apologise to customers after its Carnival Triumph boat was left adrift in the Gulf of Mexico for five days in February. The 4,200 passengers aboard the cruise suffered overflowing toilets and a shortage of food. In March, a Caribbean cruise on its Carnival Dream boat had to be cut short due to a ""technical"" malfunction of the ship's back up diesel generator. Soon after another Caribbean cruise on its Carnival Legend ship was also shortened due to a technical fault.",Shares in cruise company Carnival have fallen more than 7% after it issued a profit warning - its second in just three months.
"Passengers are entitled to claim if the last train of the night is cancelled and they have to get a taxi instead, says the consumer rights group. But it found 12 out of 26 rail firms gave incorrect or inconsistent advice to callers asking about compensation. Which? said train companies persisted in skirting the law. It described the findings as ""another indictment against train companies failing to act in the best interest of their customers"". ""The rail regulator regulator (the Office of Road and Rail) must now step in and take enforcement action against companies that persist in misleading customers on consequential loss - and train operating companies must start to advise and process passengers' claims fairly,"" it added. Secret shoppers Which? made two ""mystery shopper"" calls to each of 26 rail operators, asking whether an elderly friend or relative could seek compensation for having to get a cab home when the last train was cancelled. Six firms - Cross Country, Grand Central, Greater Anglia, Heathrow Express, ScotRail and Stansted Express - consistently and wrongly said no, Which? said. Another six companies - Arriva Wales, Chiltern, Southeastern, Thameslink/Great Northern, Virgin West Coast and West Midland - gave inconsistent advice, it added. ""When we put our various findings to these companies, ScotRail, Greater Anglia, Stansted Express and Grand Central said that they do cover consequential losses, which suggests that their individual staff members are not articulating company policy correctly,"" Which? said. ""Heathrow Express also confirmed that they intend to retrain their staff. Cross Country did not respond to our request for comment."" 'Training issue' In response to the findings, Greater Anglia and Stansted Express told Which? that they would not generally cancel a last train, but that if they did, they would organise replacement buses and taxis. Grand Central also said that it would provide alternative travel or, in the most extreme cases, hotel accommodation. ScotRail said it was grateful to Which? for ""highlighting this potential training issue"", while Chiltern said it had ""already made changes to improve clarity"". Heathrow Express said it would retrain staff. However, Govia Thameslink Railway said it did not accept the validity of the research, as ""the sample size of just two calls is too small to validate any conclusions and we have had no sight of any of the data"".","Some train companies are ""thumbing their noses at passengers"" by not paying out for costs incurred when services fail, says Which?"
"In a trading update ahead of its annual results, the Currys and PC World owner said total sales including those at newly opened stores jumped 9%. It enjoyed strong growth in southern Europe, particularly at its Kotsovolos chain in Greece. Dixons now expected annual pre-tax profits to be between £485m to £490m. Chief executive Seb James said Brexit had not changed consumer behaviour. ""We're very vigilant because there's lots of chatter about how the UK consumer is gloomy or isn't gloomy ... so far it seems that customers continue to shop in our stores,"" he said on a conference call. In the last three months of its financial year, UK sales were hit by the five-week delay for Samsung's new S8 smartphone. Revenues for that period fell 1%.

"By Suzanne BearneTechnology of Business reporter ""Let's talk about how you've been feeling over the past 30 days,"" says Joy. ""This will help me get a sense for your current state."" Joy probes a bit deeper, asking a series of questions: Do I feel hopeless? Do I feel restless? When I respond that I'm a bit stressed, Joy offers me several de-stressing techniques. Joy might appear to be my counsellor or my life coach, but the conversation I'm having is actually with a chatbot that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to track emotions and provide mental health support - all through Facebook Messenger. Welcome to healthcare in the digital age, where smartphone owners have access to their very own doctors and therapists at the touch of a button. Joy was founded by Danny Freed after one of his best friends committed suicide. ""This planted the seed for me that there must be a way technology can help anyone who is struggling with their mental health,"" he says. ""I had this realisation that we are tracking all sorts of data and metrics when it comes to our physical health, but next to nothing for our mental health."" He says Joy encourages people to open up about their mental health and feelings, and in return hands out relevant research-backed tips, techniques and exercises. But how do we know if it works? Mr Freed is certainly careful not to make too many grand claims for the app. ""Joy is not a clinical or diagnosis tool,"" he says. ""You can think of Joy more as a friend or a coach."" Perhaps aware that credibility may be an issue, Mr Freed has recently recruited a PhD student specialising in counselling psychology who is ""an expert in mood disorders with extensive clinical training in providing evidence-based therapy with adolescents and young adults"". Since Facebook opened up its Messenger platform to developers in 2016, more than 100,000 bots have been built on the platform, many focused on health and mental wellbeing. Woebot, for example, helps users track their moods and potentially spot and fend off the early stages of depression. Created by Alison Darcy, a clinical psychologist at Stanford University, Woebot employs cognitive behavioural techniques. As it learns more about you, it can see patterns emerging and suggest ways to alleviate your bad moods or negative thinking. While Joy is free, Woebot costs $39 (£30) a month after 14 free sessions. Given that counselling or psychotherapy sessions with a human can typically cost £30-£200 an hour, it is easy to see the appeal of such digital helpers. But many potential users may also have concerns about privacy, given Facebook's seemingly insatiable thirst for our data. Dr Ali Parsa, founder and chief executive of digital healthcare app Babylon, sees the m-health trend as an undoubted force for good. ""It's time to do with healthcare what Google did with information - using the power of technology to democratise access for all, and put a personal doctor in everyone's pocket regardless of geography or income,"" he says. Babylon, whose scientists, engineers and clinicians have built a knowledge bank of more than 300 million medical facts, provides users with information and advice on their symptoms based on machine learning and natural language processing. ""It can understand, reason, diagnose, make prognoses, and learn from practice, just as human doctor would,"" says Dr Parsa. Babylon also allows users to book an appointment with a GP or therapist, costing from £25. Medical chatbot Your.MD, which received $10m (£7.6m) in funding in June, works in a similar way to Babylon. It offers a free pre-primary care information service based on a user's medical history; symptoms; and personal factors, such as age and gender. Your.MD also recommends relevant local health services and products that can help you with your ailment. ""Your.MD is arguably better than doctors,"" claims chief executive Matteo Berlucchi. ""It has no bias, no preconceptions, and a superior mathematical brain."" Dr Parsa is similarly bullish. ""Babylon scientists predict we will shortly diagnose and prevent personal health issues better than doctors in most cases,"" he says. More Technology of Business But both also acknowledge that human doctors have qualities medical chatbots cannot replicate. ""They have empathy, they can look at you, assess you in the flesh, listen to your breathing, look into your ears, take a blood test, and so on,"" says Mr Berlucchi. There are plenty of sceptics out there, particularly given than many of these apps do not have to be regulated at all. Karen Taylor, director of the UK centre for health solutions at consultancy firm Deloitte, says: ""Patients shouldn't solely rely on them as a full replacement for the medical system. There are many areas that apps aren't yet equipped to handle or support."" And Richard Vautrey, acting chair of the British Medical Association's GP [general practitioner] committee, says: ""Whilst [AI and machine-learning apps] identify a bit of information and bring it together in a way to provide a diagnosis, I do think we need the skills of a trained doctor or healthcare professional to get beyond present symptoms."" But surely such apps will improve as they absorb and learn from the mountains of data they receive? Dr Claire Novorol, co-founder and chief medical officer of Ada, a health tech start-up, predicts that as its app integrates more data from sources such as lab test results, genetic tests and wearables, it will be able to identify and track health patterns and flag up possible issues in advance. ""Ada will become much more of an ongoing health companion, supporting long-term monitoring of health data to enable predictive and proactive care,"" she says. AI-supported doctor-patient relationships will be ""more collaborative"", she believes.",Could health apps and chatbots eventually replace your traditional doctor?
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The 36-year-old, a former British Young Decorator of the Year, was self-employed and doing well enough to tick along. She never expected herself to be on the breadline. But then her 15-year-old daughter, a first-rate figure skater, fell in training and fractured her hip. Natalie, a single mother from Ayrshire, took time off to look after her, only to find her return to work had been curtailed by the coronavirus outbreak. A steady income that paid the bills went down to nothing. ""There are many people in the same position as me, working successfully and never thinking we would be in this situation,"" she says. ""I had enough to get us through March, but getting into April looked hard."" Food on the table She made an application for universal credit, just like 1.4 million other people in the UK in the space of a month. The first benefits payment takes five weeks to come through, unless you take an advance. She took to the phone to organise payment holidays, most significantly for her mortgage. Financial support promised by the government for the self-employed will not reach her until June. Then, on a Facebook group, she learned about the Coronavirus Grant Fund from Turn2Us, a charity that helps people in financial hardship to gain access to welfare benefits, grants and support. The grants of £500, which are funded by donations, do not need to be paid back. People in sudden hardship, with less than £1,000 in savings as an individual, or £2,000 as a couple, can apply. Natalie was one of the very first to benefit. ""It has allowed me to pay some bills and, most importantly, for food,"" she says. ""My message is that there is help out there if you ask for it."" Where to go for help That help is being provided by organisations across the charity sector, but also through support from businesses less affected by the lockdown, banks, and credit unions. Many are drawing on the generosity of spirit displayed in neighbourhoods as they clap their support for NHS and care workers, and are translating that into financial generosity. The Turn2Us appeal has raised £1.6m in just three weeks, all of which will go to people in hardship in the form of £500 grants and increasing the opening hours of its free helpline. The money is paid within three days or less of an online application, which must include evidence of an applicant's difficulties, such as bank statements. ""It is always £500 - enough for food and bills for a couple of weeks until benefits come in,"" says Thomas Lawson, the charity's chief executive. He says that while government support is generous, it will not reach some people fast enough, if at all. That was when grant organisations such as his, as well as the welfare system, needed to step in. We should remember, he argues, that those working in job centres are also on the front line of this crisis. The charity's research suggests the self-employed, single mums and 18 to 25-year-olds who already had insecure jobs, such as working on zero-hours contracts, were particularly at risk from the economic effects of the pandemic. Overall, it estimates that 3.5 million people could make new claims for universal credit. Some 31% of those seeking help from the organisation did not have enough money to pay for food right now. ""People on the lowest incomes are often the best at managing budgets. They want the dignity of working, but there is financial fragility for a vast number of people,"" Mr Lawson says. That fragility is also leading to greater demand for borrowing small amounts of money from credit unions to pay for food, rent and bills. ""If they do not come to us, they could be going to loan sharks,"" says Jonathan Moore, chief executive of Stockport Credit Union. Its operation is much smaller than that of national charity Turn2Us, but the sentiment is much the same. In an open letter to the local community, Mr Moore asked residents and business owners to invest £1,000 of their savings in the local credit union. This is not a donation, but an alternative savings account, which is fully protected. The aim is to get 1,000 people to put money in, allowing the credit union to lend £1m at manageable interest rates to local people in need. People can join the ""Friends Of"" scheme online. ""It is the ideal opportunity for people who want to help their community if they have some money saved for a rainy day,"" says Mr Moore. For those who have seen their income fall, and face the extra costs of children at home, a small credit union loan could make a big difference, he says. 'Massive thank you' People and businesses are already making investments and donations to help those in need. One of those includes corporate finance company Oakley Advisory, which has donated to Turn2Us. ""Sadly it wasn't a surprise when we heard the sheer volume of additional calls they are getting and the increasing demand on their services across the board - from their digital services, to the thousands of people turning to them for crisis grants,"" said its managing partner Chris Godsmark. ""Charities like this are crucial in combating the secondary impact of coronavirus, which is on peoples' incomes and lives more broadly."" For those on the receiving end, there is gratitude. ""I just want to say a massive thank you,"" says Natalie Raeside, who now has the money to tide her over until government financial support arrives. ""I am so grateful, but I know there are so many other people in this position.""","Natalie Raeside has been a painter and decorator for 20 years, following in her father's footsteps."
"Bankia's parent company, BFA, which is being bailed out, was deemed to be worth -10.4bn euros. The assessments suggest losses on bad loans are even worse than expected. Bankia shares will be suspended from Spain's benchmark Ibex index from 2 January until at least after it is recapitalised, the stock exchange said. The Spanish government-owned bailout fund, which is called the FROB, said that a further 13.5bn euros of rescue money would have to be injected into BFA, on top of the 4.5bn provided by Madrid in September. The money, which is ultimately provided by the eurozone's bailout fund, is being injected into the bank via the sale of new shares in BFA to the FROB. By doing this, the FROB increases the bank's capital - its ability to absorb potential future losses on the loans it has made - by putting Spanish taxpayers' money at risk. Ordinary investors The FROB told the BFA it must provide 10.7bn of the rescue money as new capital to Bankia, which will have the effect of diluting the value of the bank's existing shares. The statement by the rescue fund has made clear that this dilution will be even worse than feared, causing Bankia's shares to drop further on the stock exchange. Its shares have lost over 80% of their value since the bank was first listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange in July 2011. Bankia is the largest of a string of Spanish banks to suffer massive losses on the loans it made to property developers and home buyers during the country's property bubble in the past decade. As well as Bankia, three other banks are currently being patched up by the FROB - Catalunya Banc and NGC of Galicia, as well as Banco de Valencia, which was in such bad shape that it is being sold off to another, privately-owned bank. Some 10bn euros of the cost associated with the four banks' rescue must be borne by other investors in the banks. This decision has proved controversial in Spain, as these investors include many ordinary Spaniards, particularly older investors, to whom their banks sold preferred shares - a high-risk form of bank debt - as a savings product. In Bankia's case, about 350,000 such investors are expected to have most of their money wiped out as part of the bank's rescue, according an unnamed source cited by the Reuters news agency.",Shares in Bankia have slid almost 20% after Spain's bank rescue fund said the troubled lender had a negative value of -4.2bn euros (£3.4bn; $5.6bn).
"Health breaks and measures to guard against repetitive stress injury were some of the changes the FLA found after an inspection. The report said Foxconn was ahead of schedule in implementing the FLA's recommendations. The review came after a number of suicides at Foxconn factories. Apple asked the FLA to investigate workers' conditions at the Taiwan-based company after reports of safety violations and long working hours. After finding numerous violations of Chinese regulation in three factories in Shenzhen and Chengdu, in March the FLA published a report with recommendations for improving conditions. Apple and the FLA set out a 15-month 'action plan' with a deadline of 1 July 2013. The report published Tuesday was a status update on the implementation of those recommendations. It found that Foxconn has completed 284 of the recommended changes, with 76 more items due. Although the deadline for compliance with Chinese labour laws is July 2013, the FLA says Foxconn has begun taking steps towards reducing working hours. The company has limited hours to 60 a week, including overtime. The FLA says Foxconn is aiming to reduce further to 40 hours a week plus an average of 9 hours overtime while protecting workers' pay. However, it added that this would be its biggest challenge in the coming year. The three plants covered in the report employ 178,000 workers making Apple products. Foxconn has 1.3 million workers in total, producing electronics for other companies including Sony and Hewlett-Packard.","Foxconn, Apple's main manufacturer in China, has taken steps to improve working hours and conditions, said the US-based Fair Labor Association (FLA)."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter This was a £12,000 increase from the same month a year ago, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, despite lenders reporting a relatively stagnant housing market. House prices rose sharply in Scotland over the year, the ONS said. Meanwhile, the cost of renting a home rose by 1.8% in a year, the ONS said. Contrasting views The ONS said that average house prices in the UK have increased by 5.6% in the year to April, accelerating from 4.5% in the year to March. This contrasts with recent figures from the Nationwide Building Society and Halifax Bank, which have shown the market stalling in recent months. ""These figures go against the recent trend of a Brexit-related slowdown that we predicted last year but remain consistent with our guidance of 2% to 5% growth in 2017 as a whole,"" said Richard Snook, senior economist at accountants PwC. The ONS survey includes cash buyers but economists point out that it still uses only a small sample of transaction data - making the short-term conclusions prone to fluctuations. Over the course of the year to April, the fastest house price rises among the nations of the UK was 6.8% growth in Scotland. Among the English regions, prices went up fastest in the East of England, rising by 8.1%. The slowest was a 0.6% rise in the North East. The annual growth in the cost of renting has slowed from 2.5% a year ago to 1.8% now. Research published on Monday showed that affordability of rent and house buying was the biggest issue for tenants of private landlords. In separate figures, the ONS said that prices in general, as measured by inflation, rose by 2.9% in the year to May - driven by the cost of foreign package holidays for British tourists, and the price of computer games and equipment. Where can I afford to live?","The typical home in the UK cost £220,100 in April, a rise of £3,500 on the previous month, official figures show."
"The cars affected are Prius and Lexus models from 2008 to 2012. Toyota and other carmakers have over the past years been rocked by millions of recalls over problems with airbags from Japanese supplier company Takata. The latest recall does not involve Takata products and the problem has not been linked to any fatalities or injuries. The recall includes some 495,000 cars sold in North America, 743,000 in Japan as well as vehicles in Europe, China and other regions. 'Risk of injury' In a statement relating to the US recall, the carmaker said the vehicles had an airbag inflator that could have a small crack in a weld which could widen over time. The airbag could partially inflate and parts of the inflator could enter the vehicle interior, leading to ""an increased risk of injury"". Safety devices made by Takata have been linked to 11 deaths and more than 100 injuries. Globally, 12 carmakers have been affected with more than 100 million Takata-related recalls under way or expected.",Japanese carmaker Toyota says it will recall 1.43 million vehicles worldwide over faulty airbags.
"Companies say the coup has already put billions worth of foreign investment at risk. The US has already said it is considering imposing additional sanctions on Myanmar, which is one of the region's poorest countries. However, the impact of US sanctions could be limited because most of the country's investment comes from Asia. According to the World Bank, Singapore was the largest foreign investor in Myanmar last year, accounting for 34% of overall approved investment. Hong Kong was the second largest investor with 26%. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) commitments into Myanmar were worth $5.5bn (£4bn) in the 2020 fiscal year, which ended in September. Real estate and manufacturing each accounted for about 20% of that figure. These figures were already expected to be significantly lower this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Will China be the winner? Vriens & Partners is a government affairs consultancy that is currently handling $3bn-$4bn worth of projects for foreign clients investing in Myanmar. The projects are mainly for energy, infrastructure and telecommunications. ""That's all at risk now,"" said the firm's managing partner Hans Vriens. ""This country has already been badly hit by Covid and by diminishing appetite to invest. And now we have this on top."" Sanctions could have a significant effect on foreign investment, with both Western and Japanese companies thinking twice about projects in Myanmar. With the US already considering sanctions against Myanmar, Mr Vriens thinks businesses might turn to China instead. ""It's really the only country they can turn to,"" he said. Impact of sanctions One Yangon-based businessman, who asked not to be named, said he's relieved that the coup so far appears to be have been relatively peaceful. ""So far it's peaceful, without protests, but emotions are strong and people are upset,"" he said. He said it's likely to have an impact on the economy, but the effect of any western sanctions will depend on whether they're broad or they target the coup leaders. The effect of sanctions could be limited, however, because the bulk of foreign investment comes from Asia. ""It will have a psychological impact, but the actual dollar figure coming in, we were never reliant on western investment,"" he said. He said engagement is a better approach than sanctions, which punish responsible companies. ""You have responsible companies that are adhering to European or US standards who are ironically most affected by sanctions,"" he said. Fashionable democracy Stephen Lamar, president of the American Apparel & Footwear Association, said many of the trade group's members did business in Myanmar and found the coup deeply concerning. ""Our hearts and prayers are with the Myanmar people for a swift, peaceful, and democratic resolution to this crisis - one that does not take away the economic progress made by the hardworking people of Myanmar,"" he said. A spokesperson for H&M said the company was monitoring events and was in close contact with suppliers, but had no immediate plans to change its sourcing strategy. ""We are closely following the developments, but refrain from speculating about what this will mean for us going forward,"" the official said. Trading halt The coup has already had an effect for one listed company. Myanmar-focused Yoma Strategic Holdings issued a trading halt in Singapore, where the company is listed. Yoma has interests in real estate, food and beverage, automotive and financial services in Myanmar. The company's chief executive Melvyn Pun said a lack of information from Myanmar made the trading halt necessary. ""It was difficult to tell what was going on. There were no telecoms in or out of Yangon [on Monday morning],"" he said. Australian oil and gas firm Woodside Energy has drilling activities in Myanmar and says its ""highest priority remains the safety of our people, their families and contractors."" ""Noting our current 2021 drilling campaign, we are working with our stakeholders to understand how these planned activities may possibly be impacted and preparing our forward plan,"" a Woodside Energy spokesman told the BBC. Slow growth The World Bank's most recent figures suggest that the economy will grow at a sluggish 2% this fiscal year, while poverty rates are expected to increase from 22.4% at the end of 2019 to 27%. Anwita Basu from financial data firm Fitch Solutions told the BBC's Asia Business Report that prior to the coup, strong growth of 6% was expected for the next financial year. Now Fitch expects that growth will be cut in half. She said it's not yet clear if the coup will have a significant effect on foreign investment. ""The biggest investors that will be impacted by this will be Asian investors, and therefore you have seen a very tentative reaction from a lot of these countries,"" Ms Basu said. For China it is an ""uncomfortable situation"", she said, because even though its Belt and Road initiative investments are fairly modest in Myanmar, China has become nervous about countries where there's political uncertainty.",Businesses and analysts predict that the coup in Myanmar is likely to damage the country's economy.
"The rise is up from the current 40%, and will mean £4.5bn of government support for the self-employed between November and January, he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a backlash from within his own party over the new lockdown. That criticism included not doing enough to help the self-employed. It was also announced that businesses will continue to be able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans until 31 January, compared with a previous 30 November deadline for some of the programmes. England will enter a second lockdown on Thursday, which will close restaurants, pubs and non-essential shops until at least 2 December, although unlike the first lockdown in late March and April, schools will stay open for all pupils. Freelancers excluded Under the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS), eligible workers can currently claim support covering 40% of their average earnings from last year to cover a period of three months, capped at £3,750. The new enhanced scheme will open for applications from the end of November, and cover 80% of trading profits for that month. Including the new higher November grant, it means the November-January payment will be at 55% of profits, up to a maximum of £5,160. However, as eligibility criteria will be the same as for previous grants, critics said it still meant as many as 2.9 million freelancers, contractors and newly self employed people would remain excluded. The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) said the new measures will give ""vital support"" to some, but accused the government of still ""wilfully ignoring a third of self-employed"". Derek Cribb, the group's chief executive, said it was important to note the enhanced 80% rate only covered November, mirroring the extended furlough scheme. ""It is vital that if the furlough scheme is extended, SEISS should be adjusted accordingly,"" he said. Support gaps ""It is deeply troubling that the government has still not fixed the devastating gaps in SEISS, despite urgent recommendations from the Treasury Select Committee. After so many calls to resolve the problems, it now looks as if the government is wilfully ignoring a third of the self-employed. ""The first lockdown drastically undermined self-employed incomes, and the gaps in government support led to the biggest drop in self-employed numbers on record. ""Unless government wakes up to the problem and supports all the self-employed, the second lockdown will accelerate the decline and hollow out swathes of this vital sector."" The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) also warned that too many self-employed people remain excluded. FSB chairman Mike Cherry said: ""This is a five-million strong community that drives our economy forward, but the government has insisted that large swathes of it do not warrant any help where income is concerned. ""We have sadly already seen 250,000 self-employed people stop working and become economically inactive, a figure which is set to continue rising. ""Fundamentally, the business support landscape still remains too much of a mixed picture - a fact made all the more concerning given that this fresh lockdown in England is taking effect during the critical festive season."" Monday's announcement increases help for many people - but, then again, many people still say it is not nearly enough. The National Audit Office said last week up to 2.9 million people have been excluded from both the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme and the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme since March - some newly self-employed, others set up as limited companies and still others denied furlough. NAO head Gareth Davies said it was ""clear that many people have lost earnings and have not been able to access support"". Some have had little or no income for months, ineligible even for benefits. Yet they've paid their taxes and say they deserve the same level of support as everyone else. According to the ExcludedUK Facebook group, of 2,400 members in a recent poll, 79% described themselves as having trouble sleeping, 81% as being anxious or stressed, 58% had low self-esteem, 48% were depressed; and 14% had had suicidal thoughts - over three times the norm in the wider population. The cross-party Treasury Committee said in June these exclusions ""cannot be right"" and Sir Keir Starmer told the CBI conference today the chancellor must close the gaps in support. But so far those gaps remain wide open.","The self-employed will be able to claim state aid of up to 80% of profits during the month-long lockdown, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced."
"Consumers in the US were expected to spend $9.4bn (£7.3bn) online on Monday, according to Adobe Analytics. The report found Black Friday, a global shopping event held last week, raked in a record $7.4bn in the US. The bumper sales come amid criticism from activists over the environmental impacts of the annual shopping sprees. The Abode report, which measures transactions from 80 of the top 100 US online retailers, found the biggest selling items on Black Friday included Frozen 2 toys, FIFA 20 video games and L.O.L Surprise Dolls. It found this year's event also set records for mobile shopping, with $2.9bn in sales coming from smartphones. Last year Cyber Monday delivered $7.9bn in US sales, Adobe said. Katheryn Russ, economics professor at University of California, told the BBC the strength of Black Friday spending was ""not altogether surprising"" given the ""hot [US] job market right now"". The US labour market has remained resilient even as recent data showed the world's largest economy grew at its slowest rate this year. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales figures will provide important insight about the strength of the US economy. ""With so much riding on the US consumer as the consumer of last resort, the combined data from Friday and [Monday's] shopping days will be monitored closely,"" Mr Halley said. Climate concerns Black Friday started in the US but has caught on around the world. The record spending has come despite a backlash from campaigners concerned that the event encourages wasteful impulse buying. Last week activists across France staged protests against e-commerce giant Amazon, including attempts to blockade shopping and logistics centres in the country. ""Certainly climate change seems to be foremost in the mind of an increasing percentage of the population. Also, we have seen more concern about plastics and waste,"" Prof Russ said. Looking ahead, she said these concerns could start to influence buying habits. ""Definitely trends like this could have a big impact over time on consumer spending decisions.""","Retailers were poised for record-breaking Cyber Monday sales following blockbuster spending in this year's Black Friday events, a forecast showed."
"By Saira SyedBusiness reporter, BBC News, Singapore The brawny super-heroes of American comic culture are taking on the starry-eyed Japanese girls of manga. For the winner, world domination and potentially millions more readers in Asia. With sales in decline at home, US comic-book giants Marvel and its old rival DC Comics have been looking towards foreign markets to grow their businesses. ""We're pushing to bring new people into stores,"" says CB Cebulski, senior vice-president and international talent scout at Marvel. ""Sales are down and we've been losing market share to things like video games, social media, to film, to piracy."" Manga dominance However, Asia already has a rich culture of comics with a dedicated fan base. Japan's manga, which tends to portray ordinary people as opposed to super-heroes, continues to be immensely popular. Domestically the industry was worth 420bn yen ($5.5bn; £3.3bn) in 2009, according to All Japan Magazine and Book Publishers and Editors Association. It has also grabbed a large chunk of the market in other parts of Asia with titles such as Naruto and Bakuman. In a survey in 10 cities in the region, manga had more than 50% of the market in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while Western comics had less then 11%, according to market research by Hakuhodo, a Japanese advertising firm. But sales are falling in Japan as well. The Japanese government has recently announced a new plan to aggressively further promote its pop culture and content, including manga, to international markets. 'Pushed back' Meanwhile, the American comic-book companies have been reaching out to new audiences through movie franchises of characters such as Thor, Iron Man and the Fantastic Four. But even with the help of movies, success is not guaranteed. And Marvel has been burned in the region before. The company made an aggressive push in Japan and Korea in the 1990s, but by Mr Cebulski's admission, it did not have the formula right. ""We tried to 'bully' our way in and then got pushed back, because we were trying to tell the Asian market what we thought they needed,"" he says. ""We've always found the Asian market a little bit impenetrable."" One of the reasons could be that Asians have long been under-represented in the comic-book world, both on the pages and in creative roles. In the past there have been accusations that any characters of different ethnicities tend to be two-dimensional caricatures. ""The first 35 or 40 years of American comics basically told stories without race, without religion, without ethnicity,"" says former DC Comics president, and currently senior adviser Paul Levitz. ""Race, in terms of true diversity, was almost non-existent in those first few decades."" But now both DC Comics and Marvel have revamped their strategies in the region. ""To change these things you need to bring in fresh writers, fresh artists with fresh perspectives,"" says Mr Levitz. Marvel's Mr Cebulski agrees that giving more creative control to local artists in Asia is one of the ways into the market. Mixing styles Benjamin Ang is one of those artists. The 27-year-old Singaporean has recently been chosen to draw for Marvel, now the biggest comic book company in the US by market share. Its characters include Spider-Man, Thor and X-Men - Mr Ang's favourite. ""I've been a big fan since I was a kid,"" says Mr Ang. ""My brother collected manga and I collected American comics so we traded, and you can see my style is kind of a fusion of the two."" Mr Ang creates his digital pages and emails them to Marvel. One of his first few jobs was creating the cover for the latest Spider-Man comic. Mr Cebulski says Marvel wants these artists, as well as those from other parts of the world, to bring their influences into the Marvel universe. ""As the creator base has increased to include more African-Americans, more Asian and more females, they've brought their own sensibilities and wanted to introduce characters that reflect the world they grew up in."" But what really seems to attract readers is not just diverse characters, but making them as real to people here as Super-Man or Batman are to long-time fans in the US.",A classic battle is brewing in the comic-book industry.
"By Ben MorrisBusiness reporter, BBC News Madame Valerie was the Belgian founder of Patisserie Valerie, who introduced fancy pastries to the English. At least that's according to the company's website. The problem was that Patisserie Holdings, the owners of the now struggling chain, had no record of her. No photos, no documents, nothing. It didn't even know her full name. At first that seemed hard to believe, but there is one key piece of information that probably explains why so little was known about the person credited with founding the café in the 1920s. Valerie was not her name. But with some digging and some help, I can now make ""Madame Valerie"" a little less mysterious. 'Everybody got to know her' Esther van Gyseghem was born in Ostende in Belgium on 22 April 1900. In her early twenties she married Theophile (Theo) Vermeirsch. Theo had visited London before his marriage and had loved it so much he moved to the city with his new wife where, in 1926, they set up a café on the corner of Dean Street and Old Compton Street in London's Soho. They called it Patisserie Valerie. ""I don't know why the café was called Patisserie Valerie. There are no Valeries in either of the families that I have ever heard of,"" Helene (Leni) Vermeirsch, the niece of Theo and Esther, tells me. Theo had trained as a baker and did all the catering. Esther was front of house, working on the till and serving customers. According to Leni, Esther always sat at the first table after the counter ""so everybody who came in got to know her"". And over the years she became known as Madame Valerie - a rare example of a company giving its founder a name. ""She was a lovely aunt to my sister and myself. She was very generous to us,"" Leni says. Theo died in 1947 leaving Esther in sole charge. ""A woman who ran her business on her own from 1947 to 1965 - I never remember her complaining. She did it well, people liked it and that was her life,"" says Leni. Following Theo's death, Leni's father helped Esther with the baking at the café and Leni can remember watching him work. ""I loved it. I found it all rather thrilling,"" she tells me. ""I was always in the bakery poking around at what they were doing and watching my father roll out, with an enormous rolling pin, great big slabs of dough that he was then putting chunks of butter in, to fold up to make the croissants."" German attacks and celebrity diners Perhaps the most dramatic moment in the history of Patisserie Valerie happened in 1941. Air raid records show a devastating Luftwaffe attack on London in the early hours of 11 May. Among the properties destroyed was the original Patisserie Valerie. Following the destruction of their business and their home - they lived on the top floor of the building - Theo and Esther were evacuated to Norfolk. But it didn't take long for them to get up and running again. According to Leni they had reopened on Old Compton Street before the end of the war. The business remained a popular venue in London, attracting celebrities - the boxers Henry Cooper and his twin brother George were regulars. Esther eventually sold the business in 1965 and retired to Balham in south London where she lived with her sister and brother-in-law. She died in 1975. Future in question Leni's memories of her aunt fill in some of the details about the early history of Patisserie Valerie. But some questions remain. Leni is not sure who her aunt sold the business to. She thinks it was to an Italian businessman based in Soho. There is also the question of the Fonteyn family. The Soho Clarion magazine credited them as the founders of Patisserie Valerie and there is some evidence of them in Soho and in the catering business. But Leni has no recollection of that name. Right now the survival of Patisserie Valerie is in the balance. Accounting irregularities that first emerged in October last year forced the company into administration last month. Some 71 cafés have already been closed and 122 are up for sale. Leni, though, is not emotional about the current problems. ""What ended up being called Patisserie Valerie did not bear any resemblance to the original one. It was valuable because it was unique.""","I was beginning to think she didn't exist. OK, I outright speculated that she didn't."
"Harald Krueger said leaving the EU without a deal would be ""lose-lose"" for the UK and industry. Mr Krueger advised Mr Johnson: ""Listen to the economy and listen to the people. He needs to be in a dialogue with business. ""I would visit Johnson to tell him this,"" he added. BMW warned earlier this year that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal it would threaten production of the Mini which is produced at its Cowley plant, near Oxford, where it employs 4,500 people. BMW is one of a number of car companies that have expressed concern about leaving the EU without a trade deal. This week, Vauxhall-owner PSA said it could move all production from its Ellesmere Port site, where it builds the Astra, if Brexit makes it unprofitable. Such a move would put 1,000 jobs at risk. BMW closed its Cowley plant for a month in April after planning for the original Brexit deadline of 29 March. However, last month it committed to begin building its new electric Mini at the site in November. In his previous role as foreign secretary, Mr Johnson last year allegedly used an expletive when discussing business concerns about a hard Brexit at an event for EU diplomats. When pressed about using the word, Mr Johnson refused to deny the claim and said he may have ""expressed scepticism about some of the views of those who profess to speak up for business"". Mr Johnson has said the UK will leave the EU by 31 October, with or without a deal. Recent figures reveal investment in the UK car industry has fallen sharply to £90m in the first six months of this year compared to £347m in the first half of 2018. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said, however, that companies' spending on contingency plans for a possible no-deal Brexit had now reached £330m. Mr Krueger made his comments after BMW reported a 28% drop in pre-tax profits for the second quarter of the year. The firm attributed this to investing heavily in electric car production and said it still expected to hit its financial targets for 2019.",The chairman of BMW has warned Boris Johnson no-one would win from a no-deal Brexit and urged the new Prime Minister to listen to business.
"It comes after the Sunday Times said senior officials had examined the idea. But a No 10 spokesperson rejected the report as ""categorically untrue."" And travel agents' body Abta told the BBC: ""The European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, flights will still operate between the UK and EU, and a visa is not required."" The UK is set to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. There are understood to be tensions among government ministers over the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, and the impact it might have on the economy. Travel freely Last week it was confirmed that while UK travellers will not need a visa to visit the EU, Britons will need to apply for and buy another document to travel to member states, post-Brexit. The document - which costs €7 (£6.30) and is valid for three years - is called an ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System) and although not launched yet, is expected to come into force in 2021. The travel requirement is not just for the UK but for many non-EU countries. Under the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in 2020. After this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return. But although they do not need a visa, UK nationals will need the ETIAS - deal or no deal.",Downing Street has dismissed claims that people will be warned not to book holidays beyond March 2019 as part of no-deal Brexit contingency plans.
"By Sameer Hashmi and Ian RoseBBC News, Dubai Held every five years, expos see hundreds of countries using pavilions to show off the latest in architecture and technology. Before the pandemic forced the event to be postponed, organisers had expected 25 million visits during the course of the six-month international fair. It will now run from 1 October to 31 March 2022. However, despite restrictions on travel, and the recent lockdowns in some parts of Europe, Reem Al Hashimy, director general of the Dubai Expo 2020, says they are holding on to the pre-pandemic target. ""The world has gone through these galactical shifts over the last year but now with vaccines being rollout, we believe that situation will settle by October. We believe the situation will be far more positive by then."" It is an optimistic forecast for an event that relies on tourism, when most of the world has cutdown on international travel. But the various in-person conferences and trade shows held in the city over the last few months has made organisers more hopeful. Organisers are also expecting the vaccination rates to gather pace globally during the summer - which would give people the confident to start making international trips again. Dubai Expo is being billed as the biggest event to be held in the Arab world. For the UAE, the showpiece event comes at a time when it is trying to recover from one of its worst recessions in five decades. Last year, the economy contracted by 6.6% even as the government announced a series of reforms to attract investment and help businesses. Some of those steps have started to show results with the International Monetary Fund upgrading the growth outlook for the UAE to 3.1% for 2021. The authorities are pinning their hopes on the World Expo to attract tourists in large numbers that would help accelerate economic recovery. Billions of dollars have been poured into the project since the UAE won the bid to organize the international fair in 2013. Dubai World Expo: Key facts The spectacle is particularly crucial for the Middle East's financial hub - Dubai - as its economic model relies heavily on sectors that are driven by consumer spending, like hospitality, luxury retail and travel. While most experts think it might challenging to achieve 25 million visits, there is a broad consensus that millions will attend the event, which could have a significant impact on the economy. ""Even if the event is partially successful it has the potential of reviving the economy and taking it back to the pre-pandemic levels,"" says Scott Livermore, chief economist for the Middle East at Oxford Economics. More than 190 countries will participate in the Expo - showcasing innovations around the themes of sustainability, mobility and opportunity. In February, the Tokyo Olympics committee announced that they would go ahead with the event in July regardless of the how Covid-19 situation evolves. Like the Japanese, the Dubai Expo organisers also have no plans of postponing or cancelling the event. ""We are applying all the necessary safety measures as mandated by the WHO and following other best practices to allow the event to take place in a safe environment,"" says Ms Al Hashimy. She also adds that there is a need for people to converge to discuss the next steps to tackle global challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Expo offers that platform. Dubai is famous for being home to the tallest building in the world and its white sand beaches. It has transformed itself from a desert backwater port into a thriving financial and tourism hub within a generation. But the World Expo is the most ambitious project for the country. The event is also at the heart of the UAE's plans for diversifying its economy away from oil. Dubai also been one of the few cities to keep its economy open since July last year when most of the world was under lockdown. Covid-19 cases remained low during the second half of 2020 but daily infections in the country quadrupled to almost 4,000 a day towards the end of January this year, primarily due to the influx of tourists into Dubai during the winter holiday season. The infection rate has fallen since then after authorities tightened restrictions at indoor venues but steered away from imposing a lockdown. To prevent another wave, fresh restrictions have been issued for Ramadan that starts next week - a month during which Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. Despite the recent wave, the UAE has managed to roll out the vaccines at a rapid pace, with more than 62% of the population inoculated. It ranks second globally behind Israel for doses administered per 100 people. The UAE aims to be one of the first countries to vaccinate most of its population and return to complete normality. This would also help in positioning it as a safe tourist destination. ""If the UAE is able to achieve herd immunity then that would be a big positive for the Expo as it would be able to attract many more tourists, especially during the second half of the event,"" says Mr Livermore.",Dubai is gearing up to host the World Expo - a year after it was originally supposed to be held.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter, BBC News ""I wanted to keep myself active and enjoyed what I was doing, so I saw no reason to stop,"" he says, sitting at his desk in his office at home. ""When I stop enjoying it, that's when I will give up."" The father of four, and grandfather of six, is one of a growing band of people who remain in work despite passing state pension age. His motivation is not primarily financial, although he says it is ""nice to have the lolly"". He has deferred his state pension and says it is a lifestyle choice to carry on. He started work as a 17-year-old, and expects to have many years to come to enjoy his retirement. Many other workers of pension age feel that they have to carry on, having realised that their pension provision is not sufficient to allow them a comfortable retirement. The default retirement age has now been phased out, so most can carry on for as long as they want to. As a result, some 12% of men above the state pension age of 65 were in employment in the third quarter of last year, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Some 11.6% of women were working beyond state pension age during the same period. 'Missing work' This was the first time since comparable records began in 2005 that more men than women worked beyond state pension age. This might be the result of the state pension age for women getting later - it is now approaching the age of 62 and will eventually move to equity with men. Yet, it may also be the effect of the financial situation on family finances, and the lower rates for annuities. An annuity is a pension income for the rest of somebody's life that is bought with a pension pot. There is also the effect of a fitter and healthier population, with life expectancy on the rise. On Friday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies reported that more women were working as a result of the increase in the state pension age. But since April 2010, 5,000 women would also have liked to continue to work, but were unable to find jobs, the IFS said. People aged over 50 who responded to recent survey by insurer LV suggesting they would work beyond state pension age, said that they would do so for six years on average. Of those who had retired and then returned to work, nearly a third said that they were too young to retire, and a third said that they missed working life. They may also be inspired by some famous faces who continue to work long after they could have sat back and drawn their pension. They include the Manchester United football manager Sir Alex Ferguson, who is aged 71, and acting great Dame Maggie Smith, who is 78. Home working The employment rate for men aged over state pension age was relatively stable in the 1990s, according to the ONS, at about 7-8%. Only in the last couple of years has it risen to its present level. Meanwhile, the rate for women rose from nearly 8% in 1993 to its current level. The majority work part-time and more are self-employed than among younger workers, with nearly a third working for themselves, the latest figures show. However, many people simply stay with the same employer who they have been with for years. Some experts suggest that the growth of the internet has added to the temptation to carry on working and supplement a pension income. Many, like Mr Timmis, use the opportunity of remote working to cut out the daily grind of commuting and set up an office at home. Choices So what are the implications for those who decide to stay in employment? Malcolm McLean, consultant to actuarial firm Barnett Waddingham, says that there are four options regarding these individuals' state pension. They are: The picture can be a little more complicated for workplace pensions, not least because employers make a contribution to the employee's pension pot. Joanne Segars, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF), says: ""People who want to keep working past retirement age can usually delay taking their workplace pension. How this happens depends on the employer and the type of pension, so people should check carefully. ""Some employers will continue to pay into the pension, others will not, and some will move the worker into a new type of pension. With final salary pensions the worker might get an enhancement to their pension if they delay it by a few years. People with a 'defined contribution' pension can simply hold off on buying an annuity. ""A lot of people decide to take their full workplace pension and also continue working part-time."" Pension forecasts Yet, the performance of some of these pension schemes has prompted a concerning forecast for those who are just starting out at work, but would hope to retire at a similar age to their parents. Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research, says that today's 20-year-olds will have to work until they are aged at least 75. Interest rates and annuity rates will remain low, he says, creating little income for those preparing for retirement. ""Workers could save more,"" he said in a recent lecture. ""But they are unlikely to do so and even if they did so around the world, they would only add to the glut of savings that is the fundamental cause of the problem."" If he is correct, then workers may find that carrying on in employment, like Mr Timmis, may be a matter or necessity rather than a matter of choice.","When accountant John Timmis turned 65, he decided that the idea of stopping work and taking his state pension just did not add up."
"By Lora JonesBBC News According to consumer group Which?, 60% of those who ordered Christmas presents online experienced problems with delivery. Keen to avoid parcels ending up in recycling bins or being chewed by the dog, more shoppers are choosing click-and-collect. Could struggling retailers use the service to boost sales in-store? Click for convenience Click-and-collect services are offered by retailers for online orders. Customers collect the goods at a local shop or designated pick-up point, such as a newsagent, when it's convenient for them. More and more retailers are now offering click-and-collect services, often free. BBC News asked some of the UK's biggest retailers how many online orders had been picked up in-store in 2018. Boots said 75% of online customers had opted to pick up parcels in-store. Marks & Spencer saw 71% collected in shops. Argos said that 60% of all sales had started online, with 80% of all sales fulfilled in Argos or Sainsbury's stores. After the supermarket chain bought out Argos two years ago, the number of click-and-collect points increased to 1,200 - with more than 260 Argos stores inside Sainsbury's supermarkets. John Lewis confirmed that 50% of all online orders had been collected in-store, or in Waitrose shops also owned by the group. Next also reported that about half of its online sales had been picked up in store via click-and-collect. Amazon UK and Asos didn't disclose their figures. But, their click-and-collect provider, Doddle, said customers now expected more when it came to delivery options - providing a new opportunity for retailers. Kitty Poole, marketing and customer experience director at Doddle, said: ""For years, home delivery has been the default delivery option - but that's all changing. ""A combination of cost, convenience, trust and increasing consumer awareness about the environmental impact of delivery choices has brought about change. ""Click-and-collect has also started being competitively priced by forward thinking retailers, which is driving uptake. ""The lure of deciding when you collect and drop off parcels is a big one."" Challenges ahead Click-and-collect has some advantages for stores. Deliveries are less costly and complicated if they're going to one shop, rather than multiple homes. But, it also poses some challenges. Logistics consultant Lynn Parnell said: ""The space to store goods while they're awaiting collection can be expensive, considering it's taking away from the sales floor. ""Staff might also need more time to sort and organise click-and-collect only deliveries."" She added retailers were having to develop additional technology to track deliveries, notify customers they've arrived, and match them to their parcel in-store. High Street shops also face growing competition from online retailers. Online spending in the UK reached a record 21.5% of total retail sales in November, according to the Office for National Statistics. That dipped slightly in December, while the amount spent and the quantity bought compared with the previous month decreased by 0.9% too. Analysts have suggested that the increasing popularity of online shopping, subdued customer demand and rising costs have combined to create a ""perfect storm"" for High Street stores. The future of shopping? With retailers having seen tough trading conditions and shop closures in 2018, it's no surprise they might be keen to capture the extra footfall to boost physical stores. Market research company Global Data estimates that 70% of those collecting or returning parcels make impulse in-store purchases. In order to encourage additional spending in shops, Sports Direct offers £5 vouchers to online customers - redeemable only in shops where they're picking up a parcel. Other retailers, including John Lewis and Selfridges, now offer dedicated, or free, car parking spaces for those collecting goods. The changing nature of online shopping has led some experts to question how bricks-and-mortar shops will adapt. Retail analyst Clare Bailey said: ""Click-and-collect is joining up the online and the physical. ""Retailers can save money and reduce their carbon footprint by having fewer home deliveries. ""I think the future will see shops become more of a showroom - where people try things out, go to tastings - before ordering to pick up later.""","So many people have experienced the annoyance of the little card on the doormat, saying: ""Sorry we missed you."""
"The US company uses the UK firm's chip technology in its iPhones, iPads, and iPods under a licensing agreement. Apple's royalty payments account for about half Imagination's revenues. Shares fell 165p to 103p, valuing the company at about £250m - down from about £765m before the announcement was made on Monday morning. Imagination said Apple, its largest customer, would stop using its products in ""15 months to two years"". Apple is developing its own technology, but Imagination said this would be difficult without infringing patents. Apple has told Imagination that it is ""working on a separate, independent graphics design in order to control its products and will be reducing its future reliance on Imagination's technology"". Imagination, like the UK's ARM Holdings, is at the forefront of computer chip technology globally. ARM was sold last year to Japan's Softbank, a deal criticised as selling out of the UK's winners. The Financial Times reported last year that Apple, which owns 8% of the UK company, had held talks about buying Imagination. In its statement, Imagination questioned whether Apple would be able to develop its own computer chip designs without breaching its intellectual property rights. The UK company said: ""Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination's technology, without violating Imagination's patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it. ""Further, Imagination believes that it would be extremely challenging to design a brand new GPU architecture from basics without infringing its intellectual property rights, accordingly Imagination does not accept Apple's assertions."" Imagination said in its latest annual report that it has other licensing deals with customers, but described the Apple contract as ""essential"". Last year, Apple paid about £60.7m in royalties to Imagination and it is forecast to pay about £65m for the current financial year. Q & A: Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor Apple's decision to go it alone with the graphics chip technology inside its devices could help the tech giant cut costs and better set the pace of innovation. But doing so risks a legal clash with its former ally, Imagination. Doesn't Apple already make its own chips? Apple does indeed design the A10 chip in the iPhone 7, and has developed A-series chips dating back to the original iPad. But these ""system-on-chips"" are made up of different components, one of which is a graphics processing unit (GPU). Until now, these GPUs parts have always been customised versions of Imagination's PowerVR designs. Apple tweaks Imagination's designs to maximise the battery life and performance of its devices. Why may Apple have an issue with using Imagination's tech? While Apple has made impressive year-on-year gains with the A-series chips' central processing unit (CPU), improvements to the GPU have been more mixed. Most recently, Apple has said the GPU in the A10 is twice as fast as the previous generation, but tests show it can only maintain this peak performance for a relatively short amount of time before risking overheating. That means it has to be throttled back. As a result, testers have given a higher rating to rival GPU tech made by Qualcomm. What's the difference between a CPU and a GPU? In basic terms, a CPU calculates single sets of instructions more quickly (or two sets of instructions simultaneously if a dual-core chip is involved), while GPUs specialise in carrying out many calculations at the same time. This makes GPUs better suited for ""parallelisable"" tasks - jobs that can be broken down into several parts and run simultaneously because the outcome of any one calculation does not determine the input of another. As the name suggests, powering graphics is one example, but others include speech recognition and pattern matching. Shouldn't Imagination have expected Apple to go it alone? Although Apple already designs its CPUs, it bases them on designs from another UK chip architecture specialist, ARM, to whom it pays licence fees. Imagination has said it doubts Apple can design mobile GPUs in-house without violating its PowerVR patents and other intellectual property. Apple is not just Imagination's biggest customer, it also owns a stake in the business and had been in discussions to take it over completely at one point. Apple has, however, hired several former Imagination workers including the former chief operating officer and hardware engineering boss. According to AppleInsider, at least 25 engineers and managers have quit Imagination and gone on to work at Apple over the past two years. So even if the current relationship between the two firms is set to end, Apple may still face having to pay Imagination for some time to come to avoid a legal battle.",Shares in UK chip designer Imagination Technologies have plunged more than 60% after Apple said it would end a deal to use its products.
