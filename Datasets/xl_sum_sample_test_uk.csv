"The Manic Street Preachers frontman, who wrote hits like A Design for Life and Everything Must Go, will play at a two-day Valley Aid concert in March. Thousands were affected by widespread flooding and flood warnings and alerts are in place across Wales. Crowdfunding pages have already raised thousands for flood-hit communities. Film star Michael Sheen, who starred in movies like Frost/Nixon and The Damned United, and Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones have between them raised more than £80,000 in online campaigns. That adds to the £10m pledged from the Welsh Government to help towns like Pontypridd and Monmouth who were submerged after nearby rivers burst their banks last week after water levels hit record levels. Welsh politicians have called on new Chancellor Rishi Sunak for a one-off grant of £30m to help pay for repair and restoration work across Rhondda Cynon Taff. Now Welsh musicians are rallying to help raise funds for the valleys in a two-day festival at the Pop Factory in Porth on 13 and 14 March. Amy Wadge, who won a 2016 Grammy for song of the year for co-writing Ed Sheeran's number one hit Thinking Out Loud, lives in the Pontypridd area and was confirmed for the Valleys Aid gig last week. Bradfield, who has had two UK number ones with the Manics, will open the Saturday show with three songs before auctioning his guitar to raise cash for flood victims. ""I text James and he said absolutely, I'll be there like a shot,"" said event organiser Emyr Afan. The Manics performed at the 2005 Tsunami Relief concert in Cardiff for victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and they also performed at the Hillsborough Justice Concert at Liverpool Football Club in 1997. The Welsh band have already donated £3,000 to an online fundraiser and Motorhead guitarist Phil Campbell, who lives in the Pontypridd area, has also pledged to help. The first night of the Valley Aid event will raise funds for Pontypridd's Clwb y Bont gig venue which was ""extensively damaged"" by flooding.",Rock star James Dean Bradfield will join Grammy award winner Amy Wadge in a fundraising event for flood victims hit by Storm Dennis in the Welsh valleys.
"The work at Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire is set to take an extra year as the council and Environment Agency try to minimise the impact on the town. Hebden Bridge, which sits in the Calder Valley, was badly flooded in 2012, 2015 and February this year. One local business said it was vital to keep the town open for trade. Calderdale Flood Recovery and Resilience Programme officials said a major concern had been how major construction works would disrupt tourism. Works are now expected to start in the summer 2021, but because the scheme will be constructed in phases it is not expected to be completed before summer 2024, taking three instead of the planned two years. Hebden Bridge flood warden Andrew Entwistle said the defence and alleviation schemes were ""one of those jigsaws where if you don't do them all, then none of them work properly"". He added: ""If they were to do it all at once it would be chaotic, that would devastate the town. ""There's a schedule of work so not closing down both sides of the river at once."" The owners of a book shop in the town had installed a moveable shop sign that can also protect their business from flooding. One of the directors of The Book Case, Jake Kirkwood said he backed the delay in finishing the flood defence works if it kept trade coming to the town. He said: ""We've certainly felt that rushing straight on after Covid, and with other road works, it would have been a complete disaster for footfall. ""We'd certainly be in favour of minimising disruption to business, what with the pandemic, and after floods it would have been a real problem for the town."" Labour Councillor Jane Scullion said the increased length of time was not ideal, but perhaps necessary. ""Given the impact of the flooding and Covid-19 on the local retail and hospitality sector, if it allows more businesses to stay open in that period and protects more life in the town, I guess that is the price that has to be paid,"" she said.

"By Robin BrantPolitical correspondent, BBC News The special committee, to be chaired by the prime minister, will include senior cabinet ministers and security chiefs. Downing Street sources say it will ""build on"" Labour's Prevent Strategy. Police probing Lee Rigby's death have arrested three more men on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, were arrested at the scene of Wednesday's killing of Drummer Rigby, 25, near Woolwich Barracks, and remain in hospital after they were shot by police. Shortly after the attack, Mr Adebolajo was filmed by a passer-by saying he had carried it out because British soldiers killed Muslims every day. Meanwhile, French authorities are investigating whether the stabbing of a soldier in a Paris suburb was a copycat attack in the wake of the murder of Drummer Rigby. 'Informal review' The coalition government reviewed Prevent in 2011 - set up after the 2005 London transport network bombings - and said it had uncovered serious failings with the existing policy. The home secretary said at the time that some of the money was going to groups who should have been confronted, not given funds. Theresa May also said the relaunched policy should recognise the impact of non-violent extremism. The coalition reduced the dedicated annual budget for Prevent from £63m to £36m. After the events in Woolwich the prime minister and some around him believe the whole approach on dealing with Islamist extremism needs an informal review. Outlining the new taskforce, the Number 10 sources told the BBC it would be ""foolish not to look again at how things are being dealt with"". The government said it would consider blocking some violent and unlawful websites - the Home Office says some filters have already been put in place since the 2011 review and it plans to develop more. Downing Street wants to look at how serious the scale of radicalisation is, something it says involves ""hundreds of individuals"". The prime minister also wants to focus on the range of powers available for dealing with extremist preachers or figures who are ""fostering extremism"". Sources say work being done to counter radicalisation in places such as universities and prisons needs to be ""maximised"". Labour sources say it is ""right to develop all these areas"" but they say much of this was promised after the review two years ago. They said the taskforce needed to look at ""what hasn't worked"" since then, ""not re-invent the wheel"". The Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee has criticised the government for what he says are serious cuts to funding for frontline initiatives, which engage with vulnerable young men. Keith Vaz told the BBC that the coalition should change the name of its strategy, saying ""don't call it Prevent, call it Engage"". He also said the government needed to take firmer action against internet search engines who give access to some of the material used to radicalise people, because, he said, ""It's not happening in universities or schools, but in bedrooms."" Meanwhile, a senior backbench Conservative MP has warned against a high profile over reaction. Bernard Jenkin, who chairs parliament's all-party group on security, said: ""I suspect it will prove more effective in the long run just to get on with this in the background... the underlying message should be, 'Keep calm and carry on.'"" Taser used Scotland Yard said the latest arrests were made in south-east London by detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command supported by specialist firearms officers. A 24-year-old man and 28-year-old man were arrested at a residential address while a 21-year-old man was held in the street in Charlton Lane, Charlton. A Taser was used on the 28-year-old man and the 21-year-old but the suspects did not require hospital treatment. Police said they were also searching four residential addresses in south-east London. Scotland Yard added that a 29-year-old man arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder has been bailed to return pending further inquiries.","David Cameron is to set up a taskforce to ""look again"" at the government's strategy for dealing with extremism and radicalisation in the wake of the killing of a soldier in Woolwich."
"Nick RobinsonPolitical editor That's what David Cameron said the people were demanding on the morning after that broken immigration promise. What was striking about his speech though, was that it proposed no new direct controls on immigration at all. In the long weeks of agonising that preceded today, there had been a lot of talk about an emergency brake on EU migration or a cap on numbers. But they were ideas that never saw the light of day. The reason why is revealing: they got an icy reception in capitals around Europe, where the idea of curbing benefits was greeted much more warmly. Ambassadors and diplomats were invited to the Foreign Office today to watch the speech and be briefed on what it really meant. A reminder that none of the prime minister's ideas is possible, without the agreement of the EU after a lengthy negotiation. Nothing, in other words, can change for a long time. David Cameron tried to reassure his own party though by warning Europe that if he didn't get his way, nothing was ruled out. A hint, at most, that he might one day advocate leaving the EU. Such a small hint though, that this speech was much more warmly greeted by relieved pro-Europeans than frustrated hard-line sceptics.",Control. Control of who comes here. Control of what benefits they receive.
"More than 100 miners were evacuated from Daw Mill Colliery after the blaze broke out 1,770 ft (540m) below the surface on Friday afternoon. Kevin McCullough of UK Coal said: ""This fire is on a scale not seen for decades - the industry has seen nothing like it for between 30 and 50 years."" Daw Mill was due to close next year and its future is now in doubt. UK Coal said it would take anything from three to six months to resume mining at Daw Mill because of the fire. ""Given it will now be closed for a number of months, the reality of us ever getting in there to mine commercially again is very very slim,"" said Mr McCullough. The fire was caused by spontaneous combustion at an old coalface where salvage work was being carried out, said UK Coal. 'Unprecedented in scale' Mr McCullough, the company's chief executive, said 96 miners were initially evacuated. A team of 14 remained underground to try to bring the fire under control. He said: ""We deal with these fires regularly but this one was unprecedented in its scale and it became clear to keep the men underground was not the right thing to do and they were safely evacuated. ""The suddenness of the fire and its ferocity is something we train for and hope never to see, so the safe evacuation of over 100 miners is something the whole team can be proud of."" Mr McCullough said the fire was still burning on Monday morning, although it was showing signs of subsiding. He said staff were able to work on the surface of the mine at Arley, near Coventry, but management teams were assessing the future of the site. 'Just speculation' The Health and Safety Executive has begun an investigation into the incident. Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers, said all staff at the colliery were asked to go to work on Monday as normal. Those without specific jobs were sent home for the day on full pay. He said: ""It could be 72 hours before the fire is put out. ""Talk of work not starting up in that part of the colliery for another three to six months is just speculation."" The colliery's closure could lead to the loss of about 800 jobs. Marcus Jones, Conservative MP for Nuneaton, said he was talking to the mine's owner and unions and was ""hopefully"" meeting ministers to discuss the future of the site. ""There needs to be a dialogue to try to make sure that we help the people affected by the tragedy,"" he said.","Mining is unlikely to resume after a ferocious underground fire at Warwickshire's last pit, UK Coal says."
"Net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving the UK - fell 81,000 to 246,000 in the year to March 2017. More than half that change is due to a decrease in net migration of EU citizens, which is down 51,000. The government is committed to reducing net migration to below 100,000. Immigration Minister Brandon Lewis welcomed the new figures, saying: ""It was good to see a third quarter running of net migration figures coming down"". But business groups raised concerns about the fall, with the CBI saying: ""The loss of these vital skills should concern us all."" The ONS figures show a particularly sharp rise, of 17,000, in departures of citizens from the so-called EU8 countries - Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. An ONS spokesman said: ""These results indicate that the EU referendum result may be influencing people's decision to migrate into and out of the UK, particularly EU and EU8 citizens. ""It is too early to tell if this is an indication of a long-term trend."" The ONS figures show that immigration from all countries has fallen - and emigration has also risen. Exit checks International migration for work remains the most likely reason to move, said the ONS, but it added that people are now more likely to move if they have a definite job, rather than to just look for work. A spokesman for the Institute of Directors said ""no one should celebrate these numbers"". ""Given unemployment is currently at its lowest level ever (4.5%), without the three million EU citizens living here the UK would have an acute labour shortage. ""Signs that it is becoming a less attractive place to live and work are a concern,"" he added. Analysis By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani Are there other factors beyond a suspected Brexit effect? Since the Brexit referendum, the falls in the pound on currency markets mean that money made in the UK buys less back home. This is really important for workers who are sending cash back to their families - and a decisive factor in decisions to move all around the world. Last June, the pound bought almost 6 Polish zlotys. Today, it buys only 4.6 zlotys. What's more, when people choose to move to another country, they're not just looking at the circumstances there, but, fairly obviously, at the conditions at home. And there is no doubt that for some EU workers, coming to the UK isn't the slam-dunk deal it once was. Read Dominic's full analysis Matthew Percival, head of employment at the CBI, said EU nationals made a ""crucial contribution"" to the economy. ""This latest data reflects a trend many businesses have seen - an increase in the number of EU citizens leaving the country,"" he said. ""The loss of these vital skills should concern us all, underlining the importance of urgently providing certainty for millions of workers and their families."" The government has also published the first ever ""exit checks"" data - a proper count of all people who are actually known to have left the UK. For the year to March 2017, the data shows that 97% of students from outside the EU with a visa to enter the UK are known to have complied with the terms of their visa by either departing the UK or remaining in the country by extending their visas. It is not clear what had happened to the remaining 3% whose visas had expired. This previously unknown figure runs contrary to repeated claims that international students are abusing the immigration system to stay illegally in the UK. Labour's shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it showed Theresa May's ""long-running campaign to malign international students"" was ""based on fantasy"". And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the NHS was facing recruitment problems due to the lack of EU workers - and the UK needed a migration policy based on the ""economic needs"" of the country. The Lib Dems called the overall drop in net migration a ""deeply worrying Brexodus of EU citizens"", blaming the government's failure to guarantee their rights to stay in the UK after Brexit.",Net migration has fallen to the lowest level for three years after a surge in the number of EU nationals leaving the UK since last June's Brexit vote.
"Transport minister Keith Brown said Abellio, Arriva, FirstGroup, MTR and National Express had passed the pre-qualification stage of the process. ScotRail provides passenger train services throughout Scotland. FirstGroup currently holds the franchise, which is due to expire on 31 March 2015. ScotRail operates more than 2,000 train services a day, delivering more than 76 million passenger journeys and 1.6 billion passenger miles a year. The franchise employs a total of 4,300 staff. Mr Brown said the five shortlisted companies had demonstrated, in their responses to the pre-qualification questionnaire, ""an understanding of, and a commitment to realise, our ambitions for a transformed rail service"". He added: ""I am convinced that this strong competition will deliver a great public rail service for the people of Scotland."" A draft invitation to tender will be published on 19 November.","Five rail companies have been shortlisted by the Scottish government to bid for the ScotRail franchise, which is due for renewal in 2015."
"The proportion of people rating their life satisfaction as seven or more out of 10 rose from 75.9% to 77.0%, the Office for National Statistics said. It said the Olympics and Diamond Jubilee may have ""influenced people's assessment of their... well-being"". The survey is carried out to help the government develop policies to improve people's well-being. The ONS also compared its data from 2007-2011 with European Union figures for that period and found that the British were happier than the French, Germans and Italians. The UK ranked 10th for life satisfaction out of 27 EU countries, according to the European Quality of Life Survey, with an average rating of 7.3 out of 10 in 2011. The ONS said the UK's rating was unchanged between 2007 and 2011, showing a ""picture of stability"" in contrast to a decline in happiness in many EU countries. Most content It also showed a small reduction in anxiety levels, with the proportion of people rating their anxiety at a higher level of six or more out of 10 falling from 21.8% to 20.9%. Women rated their anxiety levels higher than men. The average anxiety rating for women is 3.1 compared with 2.9 for men. Yet on balance, women were found to have higher life satisfaction, consider their activities to be more worthwhile and rate their happiness slightly higher than men. People aged 45 to 54 were the most dissatisfied, while younger people rated their happiness above average and retired people were the most content age group. Married couples or those in civil partnerships rated their life satisfaction highest, with the average score at 7.8 out of 10. The ONS pointed out that this was higher than for cohabiting couples who reported an average of 7.6 out of 10. Widowed and single people rated their life satisfaction lower than those in couples, at an average of 7.3 out of 10 and 7.2 out of 10 respectively. However, divorcees or separated people rated their life satisfaction lowest, at an average of 6.8 out of 10. Bank holiday The ONS said the reason for the small uptick in the nation's well-being between 2011/12 and 2012/13 was ""not fully understood at this stage"". Though measuring happiness was ""complex"", the ONS said the factors most associated with personal well-being were health, employment situation and relationship status. The survey found no significant changes in average ratings for life satisfaction for any of the self-reported health groups or among unemployed people - despite improvements in the labour market. It did however identify an improvement in average ratings for life satisfaction among people in all relationship statuses. The ONS said that over the past year, the UK had celebrated several special events, such as the Queen's Diamond Jubilee which included a special bank holiday and the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic games. Glenn Everett, programme director for measuring national well-being at the ONS, said the events may have boosted well-being because they were perceived as ""one-off"", ""once-in-a-lifetime"" events. ""The other part is that Britain did well in the Olympics and the Paralympics,"" he said. The first well-being survey was released by the ONS in 2012. Prime Minister David Cameron described it then as crucial to finding out what the government can do to ""really improve lives"" - but Labour ridiculed the survey as a ""statement of the bleeding obvious"". The government maintained that it wanted to take into account quality of life alongside its ""key priorities"" of creating economic growth, jobs and opportunities. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: ""Finding out what will really improve lives and acting on it is important and having evidence will help us to find the best ways of doing so. Today's figures published by ONS are a welcome further step towards developing trusted and accepted national statistics for well-being to inform our decisions.""","A UK-wide well-being survey has found ""small improvements"" in people's happiness over the year."
"By Vincent KearneyBBC NI home affairs correspondent Pledging to do everything possible to catch the killers, she said ""there should be no hiding place in any country for these people."" The Irish government was equally strong in its condemnation. Irish prime minister Charles Haughey said those responsible ""must be utterly repudiated and brought to justice."" But 25 years after the bombing, no-one has been convicted. The Historical Enquiries Team, which reviews all unsolved murders during the Troubles, recently completed its investigation of the attack and passed a file to the PSNI's Serious Crime Branch. The HET does this if it believes there are realistic evidential opportunities that have not been pursued. The families of the 11 people killed and the 63 who were injured hope the PSNI will launch a new investigation, but it could be months before a decision is reached. One former officer with detailed knowledge of the investigation says he does not believe there will be a conviction unless someone with direct knowledge of the attack comes forward and provides information about who was responsible. It has been claimed that Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness could be in a position to provide such information. Police sources say the IRA's Northern Command knew about plans for the Enniskillen bombing in advance and sanctioned it. It's claimed that Martin McGuinness was a member of Northern Command at the time. He has denied that was the case, and that he had any advance information about the attack. It has also been claimed that shortly after the attack, Martin McGuinness visited members of the IRA unit responsible to ask what had gone wrong and why so many civilians had been killed. He previously told the BBC that if he did go to such a meeting, he did so in his capacity as a senior member of Sinn Fein. Questioned about the bombing during the Irish presidential election campaign last year, Martin McGuinness denied he was a senior figure in the IRA and the time and said he felt ""ashamed"" by the attack. Unionist politicians and relatives of those killed and injured have said the deputy first minister should demonstrate his shame by co-operating with any police investigation. Daphne Stephenson was one of those who was injured. She was buried beneath rubble when the bomb exploded and still has flashbacks about what happened. She told the BBC she believes the victims of Enniskillen have been forgotten and that many questions remain unanswered. ""There was millions spent on the Bloody Sunday inquiry, it seems there is justice for some parts of the community and not for others. Why isn't there any inquiry for us?"" she said. ""We need to know why the police didn't search the reading rooms (where the bomb was planted) and we need to know what Martin McGuinness knows about this."" Libya In a statement to the BBC, Sinn Fein said Martin McGuinness has said many times in the past that he knows nothing about the Enniskillen bomb. The killings had huge repercussions for the IRA. In addition to public and political outrage at home and abroad, the bombing provoked heated debate within the IRA and Sinn Fein about future republican strategy. Many say that debate helped form the foundation for the peace process that eventually led to the IRA declaring a ceasefire and Sinn Fein taking seats at Stormont. Libya, which had provided the IRA with tonnes of weapons, including the military explosive Semtex, also withdrew its support. In a statement, Colonel Gaddafi's government said: "" Libya is aware of the difference between legitimate revolutionary action and terrorism aimed at civilians and innocent people. This action does not belong to the legitimate revolutionary operation."" Shortly before the Enniskillen bombing, a ship called the Eksund was stopped at sea with a huge consignment of weapons being sent to the IRA by Libya. The cargo included Semtex, surface to air missiles and 1,000 AK47 assault rifles. It was believed to be one of a series of consignments. It was also the last as no further shipments were sent after the bombing. The Historical Enquiries Team will not comment on what potential new lines of inquiry have been identified, but the BBC understands it may have been made aware of a potential new witness who could have information about what happened, and has not previously been interviewed by the police. The team has reviewed around 1,700 killings during the Troubles and has referred just 31 files to the police, so the move is not normal practice. It could be months before the police decide whether there are sufficient grounds for a new investigation. Even if the PSNI decides to launch a new investigation, one former officer who is familiar with the original RUC investigation says he does not believe there will be convictions unless someone with direct knowledge of the attack comes forward and provides information about who was responsible. The families of those who were killed and injured will clearly hope he is wrong.","A ""desecration"" and ""utterly barbaric"" was how British prime minister Margaret Thatcher described the Enniskillen bombing."
"Devon and Cornwall Police arrested four men aged 55 to 72 after being called to Newlyn, Cornwall, on Friday after people were seen getting into the back of a van from a boat. The van was stopped near Cullompton, in Devon, at about 09:00 BST. Police said a mix of men, women and children were among the 29 people. A force spokesman said: ""They currently remain in a specially-created centre where they are being taken care of."" The four men arrested on suspicion of immigration and modern slavery offences, including human trafficking, were a 72-year-old and a 55-year-old from Lancashire and a 63-year-old and a 62-year-old from Kent. Police said they had gained custody extensions on all four suspects, who remain in custody awaiting further questioning. 'Supporting the group' A spokesman for Devon Children and Families Partnership said agencies in Devon and Cornwall were supporting the group and arrangements for temporary accommodation will be made if any of the individuals are under 18 years of age, pending further decisions about their status. He added: ""The UK Government will decide what the next steps will be for these individuals."" A British Red Cross spokesperson added: ""Our volunteers are continuing to support a number of people who are the alleged victims of human trafficking. ""We are providing them with practical and emotional support at a rest centre while the police conduct their investigations. ""Our volunteers are neutral and impartial and are concerned only with the welfare of the people affected.""","The 29 people found in the back of a van stopped by police on the M5 are thought to be Vietnamese, officials say."
"The High Court told Pembrokeshire council to review its fees after four homes said they were not paid enough to meet their costs. The council is raising its payment from £390 a week per resident to £448. Leader John Davies said the rise was ""a significant challenge"" but the homes said the new rate was disappointing. The High Court told the council in December to review the fees it paid after four homes were successful in obtaining a judicial review. Pembrokeshire council said the increase would now be back dated to the start of the financial year and applied to all the privately-run care and residential homes in the county. It will also make an additional one-off payment to reflect the loss of interest which could have been earned if the new fee had been paid since April. Mr Davies, said: ""This new fee means an additional cost to the council of almost £1.5 million. ""This will inevitably result in a significant challenge to the council in ensuring that it continues to meet its statutory obligations to vulnerable individuals who have been assessed as requiring support."" He said prior to the review the council paid higher fees than some other local authorities in Wales. ""As a result of the review only four others now pay more"" he added. But the manger of the homes that took the case to court said he was disappointed by the revised rate they had been offered. Mike Davies said it left them under pressure and meant the threat of closure remained. ""We're still analysing how they've come to the new figure but the pressure is still on us,"" he said. ""We've not been able to increase wages for a few years and there are maintenance costs which have to be paid."" During December's judicial review lawyers representing the group of four homes argued the minimum rate should be £480. Mr Davies said they were considering whether to seek a second judicial review.",A council says a court judgement ordering it to pay higher fees to around 30 private care homes will cost it an extra £1.5m this year.
"Bus company First Glasgow said the introduction of the two vehicles was a ""statement of intent"" as Glasgow aims to become a ""net zero"" city. Electric trolley buses previously operated in the city until they were decommissioned in 1967. The new buses will run on the M3 route, connecting Milton and Springburn with Stobhill Hospital and the city centre. They were built in Falkirk by Alexander Dennis and they were bought for First Glasgow with funding from electricity distributor SP Energy Networks. Described as ""state of the art"", the buses have ""mirrorless smartvision technology"" - high definition digital cameras and an interior screen. The bus firm says it removes the need for wing mirrors, helps reduce blind spots and the effects of bad weather on their vision. They also have USB charging points, on-board audio-visual next stop announcements and free wi-fi. Low emissions zone Their introduction comes after Glasgow became the first Scottish city to have a low emissions zone, where emissions standards must be met by 20% of buses which pass through the city centre. All vehicles entering the zone from December 2022 will have to meet the standards. Operator First said it was already 40% compliant with the regulations and it has promised to introduce more low-emissions buses. Managing director Andrew Jarvis said the business wanted to make buses ""part of the solution"" to improve air quality in the city. The new buses will make bus travel easier and more convenient for travellers as well as being better for the environment, he said. ""Every customer journey on the route will save around 2kg of CO2 compared with driving on your own in an average car, making bus the best choice in reducing the impact on the planet,"" he added. Back to the future for electric traction Glasgow last had all-electric buses in the 1960s. The city started to develop a network of trolleybuses in 1949. It was hoped they could combine some of the advantages of trams with the ability to steer round obstacles such as parked vehicles. But in 1967 they were phased out for what was seen as a more modern technology - the diesel bus. One the last of the Glasgow trolleybuses ended up as an exhibit at the Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft in Lincolnshire. One of the new buses will be displayed at Glasgow's Riverside Museum over the weekend, before going into service on Monday. The project has been financed through SP Energy Networks' £20m Green Economy Fund. It is also backing the installation of 22 electric vehicle charging points in First Glasgow's Caledonia depot. Its chief executive Frank Mitchell said Glasgow's ambition to be the UK's first net zero carbon city by 2030 would require ""big changes"". ""The introduction of the low emission zone was the cities first big test and sets out a marker for its ambitions,"" he said. ""The introduction of this new electric bus technology which will ultimately improve air quality and noise pollution in the city centre and other communities.""",Electric buses are being launched in Glasgow on a commercial route for the first time since the 1960s.
"He died instantly. He was cycling from Land's End to John O'Groats with his brother-in-law and a friend - all three of them experienced cyclists. Since his death in 2011, his widow Kate has been campaigning for better road inspections. However, the RAC claims ""shocking"" new figures prove road conditions are worsening. New research has revealed more than half a million potholes were reported by members of the public to local authorities for repair last year. The data was obtained from Freedom of Information requests to the 212 councils responsible for roads in Great Britain, of which 161 authorities provided comparable figures. Kate, from North Somerset, said the pothole that killed her husband had been reported to the local council twice by a police officer and by their own inspection team. ""The local authority didn't take any action,"" she said. ""And the consequences of their inaction was the death of Martyn, devastation for his family and friends, and our future was stolen."" The A-road that they were cycling on was generally in good condition and was far better than others they had faced. After spotting a pothole around a drain, Martyn's brother-in-law called back to warn the others. But for Martyn it was too late. ""The first I knew was two police officers turned up at my work,"" Kate recalled. ""They turned up and they obviously said that Martyn had been killed. ""They couldn't tell me what had happened to my brother. He couldn't speak when he got home. He was so traumatised by it."" Kate had been planning a surprise trip to Scotland to watch the three of them cross the finish line. She said that people don't realise the threat that potholes can pose and said the latest figures were ""upsetting"". ""What is dangerous to a cyclist can be perfectly safe for a motor vehicle."" The government said it was spending £6.5bn on road repairs from 2015-2021. More than 512,000 potholes were reported to the 161 local authorities, up 44% on the 2015 figure of 356,000 potholes from 152 councils, the RAC said. Extrapolating the numbers to take account of councils unable to provide data, the RAC believes the increase in reports over two years is 33%. As well as being a danger to road users, potholes also caused problems to vehicles. Among the most common were damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels. Earlier this year, drivers breaking down after hitting potholes reached a three-year high, according to the RAC. RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: ""Perhaps motorists are more inclined to report pothole defects than they were a few years ago, but we believe the sheer size of the increase is further proof the condition of our roads is worsening."" He added the figures were ""just the tip of the iceberg"" as thousands of potholes go unreported every year. One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition and the frequency of road resurfacing has declined, according to the Asphalt Industry Alliance. In October's budget, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced an extra £420m of funding for councils to tackle potholes, on top of an existing fund of almost £300m. Martin Tett, the Local Government Association's (LGA) transport spokesman said councils were fixing a pothole every 21 seconds but needed more funding to ""embark on the widespread improvement of our roads that is desperately needed"". He said the LGA was calling on the government to reinvest a portion of existing fuel duty into local road maintenance to fund a ""£9.3bn road repair backlog"". Kate said the danger of potholes hadn't ever occurred to her before Martyn was killed, and that she was driven to speak out after hearing a segment on potholes on the local radio. ""People were ringing up and saying my alloy wheels were damaged and it made me really angry,"" she said. ""They're far more dangerous than that.""",Martyn Uzzell was on the latest leg of a charity bike ride when he hit a pothole and was thrown into the path of a car.
"The victim said James Farish dragged him by his hair at Underlay Hall School in Kirkby Lonsdale in the 1980s. Mr Farish, 58, of Oakwood, Kendal, is one of four former teachers on trial for alleged physical abuse at the school. He denies one assault charge. A fifth man has been acquitted. The witness said Underlay Hall was ""brutal"" and he ""hated"" both the school and his then teacher Mr Farish. Having received warnings about bad behaviour, the witness told jurors how Farish ""dragged me out of the classroom by my hair"". 'Almost passed out' He said: ""He was trying to calm me down and I wasn't calming down because I didn't like him. ""He grabbed me by the neck. He was squeezing that tight I almost passed out because I couldn't breathe. I was begging him to let go."" The man said Mr Farish started throwing him about ""like a rag doll"" and claimed the teacher also used a knuckle to ""whack me on the head"". He said he was left with ""little lumps all over my head"". The school's former owner Derrick Cooper, 77, of Hillberry Green in Douglas, Isle of Man, denies six assault charges and two of child cruelty. Fred Trevor Taylor, 75, of Lower Park Royd Drive in Sowerby Bridge, and David Hadwin, 71, of Raygarth Gardens in Kirkby Lonsdale, both deny one assault charge.

"By Vincent KearneyBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent The hugely contentious area of abortion is one of them. The previous justice minister, David Ford, tried and failed to change the law. When asked on Wednesday how she would deal with the issue, Ms Sugden said her approach would be ""subtle"". But subtle is not a word many would use to describe the debate on proposed changes to the law during the past year. The new minister was assured she has and will have the ""full confidence"" and ""full support"" of the first and deputy first ministers. That is something that Mr Ford never enjoyed. With the DUP and Sinn Féin diametrically opposed on the proposed changes to abortion law, that declaration of support will be strongly tested. On another contentious issue - same sex marriage - Sugden has said she plans to talk to executive ministers behind closed doors in attempt to change the approach to the issue. Of course, prisons are also highly contentious. As the daughter of a former prison officer, Ms Sugden will be more aware than most of the complexities and dangers involved. Two prison officers, David Black and Adrian Ismay, were killed during Mr Ford's time as minister, and the threat remains high. She will also be aware that her family background means every decision she makes about prisons, and the staff who work in them, will be subjected to intense scrutiny. A major reform programme has been under way for a number of years and a huge amount of work remains to be done. It was only seven months ago that a team of inspectors described Northern Ireland's high security prison at Maghaberry near Lisburn as one of the most dangerous in Europe. A follow up report in February said the situation had stabilised and improved, but it was far from a clean bill of health. Getting the funding needed to implement comprehensive reform, and improve the fabric of the prison estate, will be a huge challenge. It will also be another test of the promised support of Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Policing is another area of intense public and political scrutiny. 'Huge task' The chief constable is operationally independent, but it is up to the justice minister to set high level policy objectives and, most importantly, to determine the PSNI's annual budget. George Hamilton has said several times since his appointment that budget cuts have had a huge impact on the ability of his officers to do their jobs. So the new minister probably will not have to wait long for a chunky business case to land on her desk setting out why the PSNI needs more resources. Ms Sugden faces a huge task. Mr Ford has said publicly that he could only do the job of justice minister with the assistance of a very able Special Advisor (SPAD), and the support of his fellow MLAs and the Alliance party apparatus at Stormont. His successor does not have a party to turn to for advice or support. It is herself alone.",Claire Sugden will not have to look too far or wait too long for a controversial issue to raise its head in the world of justice.
"Thomas Ellison, 33, of Fenham, Newcastle, placed the lunchbox containing wires, a circuit board and a doll on the city's High Level Bridge. A member of the public called the police, leading to parts of the city centre being sealed off. Ellison admitted causing a public nuisance but claimed it was ""art"". Sentencing him at Newcastle Crown Court, Judge Edward Bindloss said he was ""naive"" but showed genuine remorse and had no previous convictions. The alert started when a member of the public saw the lunchbox on 15 August 2017. Several roads in the city were sealed off for two hours, but eventually police discovered there was no threat to the public. Trains were stopped and the emergency services attended, costing £3,500 overall. The following day Ellison called 999 and asked for the piece to be returned to him. Detectives were able to trace the phone box he was calling from and identified him by his fingerprints. The court heard Ellison had seen a similar exhibit in Prague, and wanted to do the same on Tyneside.","A student who left a piece of artwork on a bridge, sparking a major bomb scare, has been sentenced to 90 hours of community service."
"Daniel Mee, 25, and Jayden Dolman, 20, died on 3 July 2019 during a holiday in Alicante, Spain. The men had been ""larking about"" taking photographs when they toppled over a railing, the inquest in Taunton was told. Mr Mee was pronounced dead at the scene while Mr Dolman later died in hospital. Somerset coroner Tony Williams said their friend Lewis Higgins witnessed what had happened. ""He said he and his friends Jayden and Daniel were walking from the villa to the nearest beach. ""They were taking pictures while they were walking. Daniel embraced Jayden. He saw them both close to the railings. Then they fell."" Drinking during the day Mr Higgins told Spanish authorities the friends had been drinking during the day. The inquest focused on the death of Mr Mee, a plumber from Bridgwater, as Mr Dolman's body was not repatriated to the UK. It heard toxicology tests found the amount of alcohol in Mr Mee's blood was 215mg per 100ml of blood. The legal drink-drive limit is 80mg. Mr Williams said Mr Mee's cause of death was a head injury and recorded a conclusion of accidental death. He said: ""Daniel and Jayden are hugging close to the railings and during that, they have lost balance, they have gone over the railings and unfortunately fallen over where there is a steep drop of nine metres on the other side. ""Unfortunately, they have sustained injuries that have proved fatal.""","Two friends lost their balance while embracing near a seafront wall and fell nine metres (30ft) on to the beach below, an inquest heard."
"Greater Manchester's population of 2.8 million joined Liverpool City Region and Lancashire in England's highest tier of restrictions at midnight. And from 18:00 BST, the 3.1 million people in Wales will have to stay at home as a 17-day lockdown begins. It comes as a minister said there was a ""common purpose here to get the virus down"" so people could enjoy Christmas. ""I think few people expect it to be exactly as it would normally,"" said Chief Secretary to the Treasury Stephen Barclay - but ""the ability of families to spend Christmas together"" was ""something we all hope to be in a position to do"". Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething said the lockdown in Wales was happening now so ""we can have a much more normal Christmas season for businesses"". The UK recorded another 189 deaths and 21,242 new confirmed cases on Thursday. Warrington has become the latest place to be placed into tier three - or ""very high"" alert level. The measures will take effect next week. Nottingham and parts of Nottinghamshire are also expected to be moved into tier three next week, with the finer details such as whether or not gyms can stay open still to be decided as talks continue. The tier three alert level means people cannot mix with other households and pubs and bars will be closed - unless they are serving substantial meals. Some areas in the top tier have also gone further, closing businesses such as bingo halls, casinos, betting shops and soft play centres. Households are banned from mixing outdoors in private gardens or anywhere inside and people are advised against travelling into or out of the area. South Yorkshire will also move into tier three restrictions from 00:01 on Saturday, by which time more than seven million people will be living under England's tightest rules. Rising infections mean that Coventry, Stoke and Slough will move into tier two restrictions at 00:01 on Saturday. The ""high"" alert level means households are banned from mixing indoors and people are encouraged to reduce their use of public transport. In Wales, the ""firebreak"" means people are being ordered to stay at home and pubs, restaurants, hotels and non-essential shops will close until 9 November. Supermarkets have been told not to sell items such as clothes, as First Minister Mark Drakeford said it would be ""made clear"" they should only open the parts of their business that sell essential goods. And the Scottish government is to set out its own tiered alert system of Covid restrictions, which will come into force from 2 November. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would have five tiers, with the middle tiers corresponding roughly to England's three, plus a lower tier that is ""the closest to normality"" possible without a vaccine. She said an additional top tier would be ""closer to a full lockdown"" - and was added because England's chief medical officer had acknowledged tier three restrictions were not necessarily enough to reduce infections in all circumstances. The move in Greater Manchester comes after days of confrontation between local politicians and ministers over the level of financial support the area would receive. After the ""very high"" alert level was imposed, the government announced a more generous wage subsidy scheme, backdated to August, for areas that have been under additional restrictions. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds says ministers need to be clearer about how they decide what financial support areas will get and how long this will be for. ""Initially it was suggested there was some kind of a negotiation going on between government and local areas about support for businesses,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now it looks like actually there's a formula that's being used by government but they haven't published it anywhere, they've not discussed it, it hasn't been voted on for government."" In other developments:",Stricter coronavirus rules are coming into force for nearly six million Britons.
"But Roger Lewis said that buying the airport in 2013 was ""absolutely"" the right decision by Welsh ministers. In January, the Conservatives accused them of wasting tens of millions of pounds by purchasing it for around double an initial valuation of £20-30m. Mr Lewis said ""one will never know"" if the price was correct. Giving evidence to the assembly's public accounts committee on Tuesday, he said: ""Could one have paid less for it? Perhaps. ""Could one have paid more for it? Perhaps. One will never know. ""Because what's in the mind of the seller - and you need a willing seller as well as a willing buyer - one will never know."" Mr Lewis added: ""The headline for me, was this the right decision for Wales? Absolutely, absolutely. ""Can we enhance the value of the enterprise going forward? Yes."" 'Tipping point' Debra Barber, the airport's managing director, said the site was becoming ""worn down"" under its Spanish owners Abertis, and the idea of closing it had been raised at board meetings. Ms Barber, who worked for Abertis as operations director, said the airport had submitted a £3m programme for ""critical infrastructure"" that needed to be replaced. ""We actually got about a fifth of what we required, which just about enabled us to do the stuff that we were required to do by regulation,"" she said. Mr Lewis told the committee: ""Was it heading towards a tipping point where it could have headed for closure? The answer is yes."" Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has accused Labour of a ""stunning failure to safeguard taxpayers' money"" in paying £52m for the airport. A Welsh government spokesman said reporting of the £20m-£30m valuation had been ""entirely selective and misleading"" and accountants KPMG had ""modelled a range of scenarios during the due diligence process"".","It is impossible to know whether the £52m the Welsh government paid for Cardiff Airport was the right price, the airport's chairman has told AMs."
"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter In fact, as other MPs reminded me after his speech, Tony Blair's controversial amended version of Clause 4, included the phrase, ""The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party"". It was never an officially banned word, although no question, until Mr Corbyn's victory, talk of true socialism was not a popular subject at the conference lectern. Mr McDonnell had a long list of plans that would tickle the bellies of activists - a minimum wage of more than £10 an hour, a repeal of the Trade Union Act, more intervention to stop corporate bad behaviour, more borrowing to invest in infrastructure. But even before Mr McDonnell took to the stage to give his speech, another row had broken out and this time, a spat between one of Mr Corbyn's most loyal supporters, the shadow defence secretary Clive Lewis, and the leadership. Mr Lewis was seemingly furious, and hit the wall in frustration, when a line from his speech about the party's position on the nuclear deterrent was changed at the last moment. It is a big job for Labour to get back to being credible on the economy. It's a big job to pull this party back together after the leadership contest. Tonight after that row between one of their own loyal supporters and Mr Corbyn's team, it seems it is also a big job just keeping the show on the road. You can't underestimate how distracted and distressed different parts of the Labour Party are. And as this conference progresses, it's starting to show.","It felt like John McDonnell had been waiting for a long time to say it. Up on the conference platform, at the very end of his speech, he told delegates, ""you no longer have to whisper it, it's called socialism""."

"The socially-distanced protest called for the Velindre University NHS Trust to abandon £180m proposals for the Northern Meadows in Whitchurch. They say it will lead to a loss of green space, and over 10,000 people have now signed an online petition. The hospital trust said the fields were the only suitable location. Outline planning permission was granted for the hospital two years ago but problems in arranging site access have caused delays. Two new planning applications are hoped to resolve the issue. Tessa Marshall, who organised the online petition against the proposals, said local people needed access to green spaces in the city, especially during the ongoing coronavirus crisis. ""It's just incredible that we've managed to raise awareness for so many people,"" she said on Saturday. ""I think it shows that a lot of people, when they found out about the development on this site, they were against it."" Cardiff councillor Mia Rees is also opposing the plans and was one of several of the city's elected members who turned out for the protest. ""It's a fantastic turnout, and it is because they care about this green space in this part of Cardiff,"" she said. ""It's not an issue that we don't want the hospital to be built, we just don't want it to be built here - here is not the right place. ""It's a gorgeous place bordering a nature reserve.

"By James LandaleDeputy Political Editor, BBC News Ministers will announce that they will protect the Isle of Wight from some of the boundary changes designed to ensure that parliamentary constituencies have roughly the same number of voters. This was one of the key demands made by peers as the bill introducing the changes went through the House of Lords. The Isle of Wight is a large constituency with some 110,000 electors. Under the government's plans, it would have been divided into two constituencies - but with one attached to the mainland across the Solent. This prompted substantial opposition. The government has now decided that the Isle of Wight will be divided into two seats - but within the geographic boundaries of the island. On 19 January peers backed an amendment - by 199 votes to 122 - that would protect the Isle of Wight from being divided up. This was the largest defeat the Government had suffered in the House of Lords - there were 28 Tory and 14 Lib Dem rebels. Government sources said they would now accept the principle of the amendment that was passed in the Lords. The Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill would cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and change parliamentary boundaries so that constituency electorates are broadly the same - within a 10 percent leeway. The bill already excludes two constituencies from the changes because they are geographically large and distinct: Orkney and Shetland, and Na h-Eileanan an Iar (the Western Isles). Labour will accuse the government of bending the rules to create a new Conservative seat.",The government is to make a concession in an attempt to persuade MPs and peers to back its plans for a referendum on voting changes on 5 May.
"By Jim Reed and Sean ClareVictoria Derbyshire programme The Fire Brigades Union said during the fire ""access was an issue"", with ""huge difficulties"" getting past parked cars. Narrow streets and bollards also caused fire crews problems, witnesses told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. The council said it could not comment because of an ongoing inquiry. Access 'restricted' Plans to build a new academy school at the foot of Grenfell Tower were opposed by many residents, who felt the area was already congested. The council received 318 letters opposing the Kensington Aldridge Academy, and just two in support. An email sent in 2010 to councillors by local resident Francis O'Connor, a member of the Grenfell Action Group, said the plans meant emergency access to Grenfell Tower would ""certainly be compromised"". An 80-capacity car park was demolished to make way for the school in 2012. Campaigners said that pushed more cars on to the surrounding streets, making it difficult for large vehicles such as fire engines to access the site. A Grenfell Action Group blog post from January 2013 warned about access to the southern side of the tower. It read: ""There is barely adequate room to manoeuvre for fire engines responding to emergency calls, and any obstruction of this emergency access zone could have lethal consequences in the event of a serious fire or similar emergency in Grenfell Tower or the adjacent blocks."" The Fire Brigades Union said its members had reported a number of problems accessing the site. ""We're hearing from firefighters at the scene that lots of cars were parked where they shouldn't have been,"" said Lucy Masoud, a senior official. ""The fire engines couldn't get past."" ""The road is very, very narrow anyway, but they had huge difficulties getting to the dry riser [a pipe that sends water to different levels of the building] because of parked cars."" ""We'll want access issues and any changes to the area surrounding Grenfell - including the building of the academy - to be part of the public inquiry,"" she added. One anonymous firefighter wrote on the Save the UK Fire Service Facebook page in June: ""We arrived about 01:20, but, due to the way cars are parked in the streets and the fire engines that are arriving with us, we couldn't get closer than four to five streets away from the building."" Witnesses also spoke about fire trucks queuing to reach the tower. ""There were bollards blocking the fire brigade from coming into the green and parking,"" Mahad Egal told the Victoria Derbyshire programme hours after he escaped from the tower. The Reverend Mike Long, from Kensington Methodist Church, opposite the academy, said at least one parked car had been forced out of the way to allow access to the northern part of the site. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it was ""committed to cooperating fully"" with the ongoing public inquiry and did not ""think it was right"" to comment on areas relating to it. The London Fire Brigade said with 40 fire engines and more than 200 firefighters attending it was ""inevitable"" that not all vehicles would be able to park next to the scene of the fire. ""For that reason, we have tried and tested procedures, including rendezvous points and marshalling areas, that ensure our crews can be rotated in and out of an incident as quickly, safely and efficiently as possible,"" it said. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","Kensington and Chelsea Council was warned as early as 2010 that building a new secondary school at the base of Grenfell Tower could block emergency vehicles' access, the BBC has learned."

The Jo Cox Memorial Grant will be made to grassroots organisations on issues the Labour MP campaigned on, she said. Ms Mordaunt also called for everyone to ""raise their game"" to help make gender equality a global reality. More from Yorkshire Speaking in London earlier, Ms Mordaunt said: ""Jo was a dedicated humanitarian who fought for gender equality at home and in developing countries. ""Her passion and commitment will continue to support the world's most disadvantaged and disenfranchised women through these new UK aid grants.""

""It is only by everyone raising their game and making gender equality a reality that we will build a more peaceful, safe and prosperous world for us all."" Mrs Cox's sister Kim Leadbeater, said the late MP spent 20 years working in the voluntary sector and overseas. ""These grants are a reminder of that and a reminder of her passion and her determination to hopefully inspire others with similar desires,"" she said. ""Jo would be over the moon,"" she said.

"Baroness Newlove, the Victims' Commissioner, said many people who raised concerns about their treatment were left feeling ignored. Helen Newlove came to prominence after her husband was killed by a gang of youths outside their home in 2007. This is her first major review since being appointed as a commissioner in 2012. The report looked at the experiences of more than 200 victims who had complained about how they were dealt with by services including the police, probation and the courts system. 'Dismissed and confused' Almost 75% of those consulted said they were unhappy with the response they received and more than 50% found the relevant agency's complaints process difficult to use. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that victims need time, understanding and compassion. ""Victims will only be at the heart of the criminal justice system if you allow them to understand the journey they are going through,"" she said. Baroness Newlove said it was clear many victims were still not getting the service they deserved and there was a gap between what criminal justice agencies described and the victim's experience. ""All it takes is basic human decency to explain to a victim, in a sensitive and timely way, why something has gone wrong and what they can do about it."" she said. ""It is shocking how many victims told me how ignored, dismissed and confused they felt when they tried to raise concerns about their treatment."" One victim said the complaints process was so daunting that it ""was almost worse than the actual journey of being a victim"". Another told the review: ""I'm just frightened. I think they will harass me if I complain about the way they have treated me and my daughter."" The commissioner has laid out a new set of standards which she expects the government and agencies to adopt when responding to concerns from victims. Victims' Commissioner's Standards Victims' rights campaigner Maggie Hughes, whose son Robert was left in a coma after being attacked, said: ""We victims are not just complainers. ""If anything, we are thrown into a new world of rules and regulations and then into a dark labyrinth of the unknown. ""This important report shows just how crucial it is to listen to victims. If we feel that we are not satisfied with a service, then we should be able to get clear guidelines on how to complain, regular updates and a full explanation of the outcome."" Victims' minister Mike Penning said the government had already committed to giving victims legal rights, and strengthening victims' entitlements through the Victims' Code, and was reviewing whether new powers are needed ""so that they can better hold the system to account."" He said: ""I welcome Baroness Newlove's dedication and hard work supporting my goal to make the system better for victims. ""She recommends many sensible new standards in this important report, which I will carefully consider.""","Victims in England and Wales are still being let down by the justice system, according to an independent review."
"Baroness Vere of Norbiton said the proposed law would protect the ""bodily dignity"" of both men and women. She told the Lords this would include ""kilt upskirting"", as she briefed them about the government's plans. The government announced it was intervening after a backbench MP blocked an attempt to change the law. If passed, its new law would see someone who has secretly taken a photo under a victim's clothing face up to two years in prison. A bill will be introduced in the House of Commons on Thursday, with the government promising it will make progress before the summer recess begins. In the House of Lords, Labour's shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti welcomed the proposed new law. ""Our feminism is to be judged by deeds not words,"" she said. ""Not only statues but statutes protecting all women's bodily integrity and dignity."" In response, government spokeswoman Baroness Vere said: ""This statute actually protects all men and women and their bodily dignities, as it does indeed include kilt upskirting, which I only recently became aware of."" In Scotland, a ban - which refers to operating equipment under people's clothing - has been in place since 2009. Conservative backbench MP Sir Christopher Chope faced a backlash on Friday when he shouted ""object"" to a backbench bill that would have introduced a specific upskirting offence in England and Wales, which campaigners say is needed to fill a gap in the current law. He said his actions had been ""cruelly misunderstood"", saying he recognised the seriousness of the offence and that his objection was over the practice of approving a new law without any real debate - as he suggested could have happened on Friday.","Men wearing kilts will be protected from a new ban on ""upskirting"" in England and Wales, a government spokeswoman has said."
"About a quarter of school places are unfilled, while Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones in Amlwch is less than half full. Even the arrival of workers to build a nuclear power station at Wylfa would only bring 200 more pupils, they said. Anglesey council's ruling executive has given the go-ahead to a review aimed at saving £5m over three years. Council officers previously warned that up to 17 small primary schools might have to close to help balance the council's books. A report to councillors said secondary schools on Anglesey had room for 5,171 pupils, but due to falling numbers of school age children locally they only had 3,717 enrolled, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Ysgol Syr Thomas Jones posed particular concern, with room for 971 pupils but only 479 pupils on the register - representing 49% of its capacity. Arwyn Williams, the council's head of learning, said possible solutions might include federalisation, multi-site schools, and more ""super schools"" combining secondary and primary education. If sixth forms closed, courses could be offered at Coleg Menai, a further education college in Bangor. The arrival of workers and their families for the building of a new nuclear power station at Wylfa - due to start by 2020 subject to approval - would make little difference to the number of school places needed, the report added. Anglesey's deputy leader Ieuan Williams backed the need for reorganisation. He pointed to the austerity agenda and highlighted the need to make cuts. Councillor Robin Williams added: ""Head teachers are pushing us to modernise the education system with some haste, and it's important that we listen to those on the front line."" Public consultation over options for the way ahead will take place over the next 12 months.","Secondary schools on Anglesey might have to merge with primaries or lose their sixth forms to reduce empty places, council officers have advised."
"By Huw WilliamsBBC Scotland reporter The mammals, which were introduced by the Victorians to control rabbits, have a devastating impact on native birds - like the kiwi. There is a similar problem in Orkney, where stoats are not a native species, but were first spotted on the island back in 2010. The technique would alter the stoats' genes and make it impossible for them to reproduce. Professor Neil Gemmell, from the University of Otago in New Zealand's South Island, told BBC Radio Orkney: ""In New Zealand, and I'm sure the same is true in Orkney, our native birds didn't grow up with any mammalian predators. And particularly not stoats. ""And the stoats are an incredibly efficient predator. Literally, where there are stoats, New Zealand native birds do not prosper. ""And, in particular, they are really bad news for our native kiwi bird. So, where stoats are present, very few juveniles get to one year of age. In fact, probably, we lose 90% of individuals."" In New Zealand there has been a huge campaign to trap and poison stoats. And that's sometimes been controversial, because poison is applied - albeit in a targeted fashion - by helicopter. So the hope is that once the population has been reduced you could then - counter-intuitively - introduce more stoats. But they would be secret agents with genetic modifications. For example, they may be engineered only to have male offspring and to pass that characteristic on to their progeny. So, over time, it would be harder and harder for the population to reproduce itself. Releasing genetically-engineered creatures that can't breed into the landscape - that sounds familiar. Ah, yes. It's the plot of the Jurassic Park movies. And if they've taught us anything, it is that life will find a way. I was worried Prof Gemmell might laugh at the idea. But, in fact, he took it seriously. ""Nature will find a way"", he agreed. ""And the way is normally mutation. And that was exactly what happened in Jurassic Park."" But, he said, scientists can do a couple of things to counter-act that. ""You can put in back-up systems to make sure that the gene drive keeps working. And then, you have to go out and monitor things. You can't just walk away from it. You have to keep an eye on what's happening in the population. And he says there may be other factors that make such a scheme more difficult than expected. ""For example, what happens if female stoats don't find the male stoats that carry the damaged genes attractive, and don't want to mate with them? ""That would be a problem. And will these stoats, that have been bred in the laboratory, survive in the wild? ""So there's a fair bit we need to figure out first before we get to a point where we actually have genetically-modified stoats to deploy either in New Zealand or in Orkney,"" said Prof Gemmell.",Scientists in New Zealand say they hope to have a workable way of using gene editing to control pests such as stoats within the next eight years.

'Concerns and outrage' The science fiction and fantasy author has been criticised for ""endangering"" local people"". The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is the MP for the island, told the Sunday Times the author's journey was unacceptable. He said: ""What is it about people, when they know we are in the middle of lockdown that they think they can come here from the other side of the planet, in turn endangering local people from exposure to this infection that they could have picked up at any step of the way?"" Kate Forbes, SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch, also criticised the writer's actions. She said: ""The remarkable thing is that he posted a blog post about his travel to Skye - evidently oblivious to local residents' concerns and outrage about people breaking lockdown and putting their community at risk. ""The Highlands does not exist for anybody's personal self-isolation needs."" Mr Gaiman - whose main family home is in Woodstock in the USA - has owned the house on Skye for more than 10 years. The English-born author wrote on his blog that until two weeks ago he had been living in New Zealand with his wife, the singer Amanda Palmer, and their four-year-old son. He said the couple agreed ""that we needed to give each other some space"". 'Masked and gloved' The 59-year-old said he flew ""masked and gloved, from empty Auckland airport"" to Los Angeles. He then caught a British Airways flight to London before borrowing a friend's car and heading for Skye. ""I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and I've been here ever since,"" he said. ""I needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily. ""It's rough for almost everyone right now - some people are crammed together and wish they weren't, some are alone and crave companionship, pretty much all of us are hurting in one way or another. So be kind.""

"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent However work on them will be delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the improvements to be funded under the school enhancement programme (SEP). Mr Weir also told assembly members at Stormont that the Department of Education was in a ""difficult position"" providing income to substitute teachers. The SEP provides for new school buildings worth between £500,000 and £4m. Four post-primary schools, 10 primary schools and two special schools are the latest to benefit from the scheme. It provides money for parts of schools to be rebuilt rather than entire new school buildings. For instance, new teaching blocks to replace mobile classrooms or the refurbishment of sub-standard facilities. However Mr Weir said construction may not be able to begin on any of the schools for a number of years. Design teams will not be able to begin drawing up detailed plans for the work until the 2020-21 financial year. ""We're talking probably four years ahead before there'd be the direct boots on the ground of construction,"" the minister told MLAs. ""This is about ultimately trying to give certainty to those schools."" Mr Weir was also asked by the Alliance Party MLA Chris Lyttle about the hardship faced by substitute teachers. Around 3800 have lost work and pay, as schools are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The department has asked the executive for around £12m for a scheme to provide substitute teachers with a salary until the end of the current school year. How much they receive is expected to be based on their previous level of income from January to March 2020. ""I would like to bring this as quickly as possible to a conclusion,"" Mr Weir said. ""The problem is if I brought it to a conclusion immediately without any level of assistance from outside it would be a smaller package and a smaller level of support."" The funding announced from SEP is the fourth tranche from a call for applications to the school enhancement scheme made in 2017. Subsequently, 165 schools applied for building improvements. Today's announcement means that work at 74 schools in total will be carried out through the programme. The latest 16 schools to receive funding through SEP are: Christian Brothers' Primary School, Armagh Greenisland Primary School, Carrickfergus Hart Memorial Primary School, Portadown Kilbride Central Primary School, Doagh Our Lady and St Patrick Primary School, Downpatrick St Brigid's Primary School, Mayogall St Comgall's Primary School, Antrim St Patrick's Primary School, The Meadow, Newry St Peter's Primary School, Moortown Strandtown Primary School, Belfast Ashfield Boys' High School, Belfast Belfast Royal Academy Carrickfergus Grammar School Clounagh Junior High School, Portadown Hill Croft School, Newtownabbey Clifton School, Bangor",Sixteen schools across Northern Ireland are to receive building improvements worth about £40m.
"He is to meet Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, Liverpool's Steve Rotheram and Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen for the first time since their May elections. Mr Burnham and Mr Rotheram, both former Labour MPs, have warned the north is losing out over transport spending. But Mr Hammond insists record amounts are being spent on infrastructure. The government's decision earlier this summer to discontinue or downgrade a number of rail improvement schemes in the north of England, the Midlands and the Wales, while giving the go-ahead in principle for the Crossrail 2 link in south London, was greeted with dismay by political leaders in the North. They argue that the North has long been the poor relation in terms of its infrastructure, citing the continued use of the 30-year old Pacer train carriages on some routes. The Local Government Association has also warned that the government's devolution agenda, championed by Mr Hammond's predecessor George Osborne, has stalled in the past year with no announcements on the transfer of major powers since Theresa May became prime minister. What is the Northern Powerhouse? But Mr Hammond will insist that the UK's exit from the EU makes it is all the more important that every region of the country has the necessary tools to maximise their economic opportunities. ""Boosting productivity in the North is at the very heart of the government's ambition to build an economy that works for everyone,"" Mr Hammond said ahead of Monday's visit in Manchester. ""As we prepare to leave the European Union it is even more important that we support the Northern Powerhouse to reach its full potential. ""That's why we are investing record amounts in infrastructure, and working with metro mayors to encourage growth and create opportunities throughout the North."" The chancellor will inspect a new rail hub in Manchester and is expected, on a later visit to Leeds, to say that progress is made on agreeing a housing deal with the city that could be announced in the Autumn budget. The Greater Manchester, Liverpool City and Tees Valley mayoral positions were among six created earlier this year to lead their respective regions' combined authorities and to take over budgetary powers from Whitehall, including over transport, planning, health and social care. Separate devolution deals, spanning enterprise and economic growth, have previously been agreed with Leeds City Region, Nottingham, Newcastle and Sheffield City Region among others. But local council leaders are worried that ministers' attention has shifted elsewhere since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 and English devolution is no longer a priority. Also attending Monday's meeting will be Conservative Mr Houchen, who caused something of a surprise when he saw off Labour to be elected as mayor for Tees Valley, comprising Teesside, Darlington and Hartlepool. He has cited the recent agreement to create the South Tees Development Corporation as evidence of successful co-operation between national and local government.",Chancellor Philip Hammond has promised to keep backing the Northern Powerhouse ahead of a meeting with three of the region's leading politicians.

Jim Wilson said they had heard nothing from the department since her release from Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre. and she still cannot get her benefits and has to visit a Home Office reporting centre in Solihull. ""It's very difficult to tell what the sticking point is,"" he said. ""We've had no communication at all. They've had a letter saying we're applying to the court for a judicial review... they've seen documents showing she's been here lawfully."" Ms Wilson, who now lives in Wolverhampton, lived with her grandparents, when she first arrived in Britain.

Mr Wilson said her housing sickness and benefits were stopped and she is penniless. He wants the Home Office to ""acknowledge she is here legally"", entitled to benefits and that she was unlawfully detained. ""And on top of that, they need to explain why they have picked on a person in her situation and caused her such misery."" In a statement, the Home Office said there had been on-going discussions with Ms Wilson over the past three years about how she could regularise her immigration status, including contact with her MP.

"The authority wants to cut £90.6m from its budget, a quarter of its total spending, over the next three years. Major George Ferguson had planned to cut £80m but says greater savings are needed, and council job losses would be ""unavoidable"" as a result. The council's plan for making the cuts will be made public for a six-week consultation in November. 'Fast and deep' Mr Ferguson said: ""This will be a difficult budget, but I have to balance the books in the face of tremendous pressures from the falling government grant, coupled with increased demand for some services. ""We're looking at losing a quarter of our current budget: this will mean cutting deep and to a certain extent re-defining the role of local government."" He added that cuts would have to be ""fast and deep"" as the council ""cannot afford to drag this out"". Once the public consultation has been completed, changes can be made to the plans before councillors debate the budget in February next year.","Some 8,000 council staff in Bristol have been told to brace themselves for deeper cuts than expected."
"The men died after a 16-mile (26km) exercise in the Brecon Beacons in July 2013. Failings on the trek were described as ""some of the most significant"" a health and safety inspector had seen. A serving officer and former warrant officer deny negligence. Identifiable only as 1A - a captain in command of the exercise - and 1B - a warrant officer who has since left the Army - they are appearing before a court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire.

They were among the selection field required to cover difficult terrain in eight hours and 45 minutes. ""There were very serious failings, they were widespread failings,"" health and safety inspector Sarah Baldwin Jones told the court. ""Probably some of the most significant failures I've come across in many years in dealing with the Ministry of Defence. ""There was a complete and utter lack of training on JSP539 [the Ministry of Defence's guidance on heat illness]."" Ms Baldwin Jones carried out a detailed assessment of the incident and concluded: ""From my investigation and subsequent investigations I don't think there was any training provided to anyone in the Army."" She said a major issue was the fact the JSP539 document gave guidance that could the be ""interpreted by whoever's in control"". ""When you get to that level of assumption… there's a risk with that,"" she added. ""JSP539 does not cover any endurance event, it's not able to give any advice to anyone in command.""

The medic who was asked to look at the plan was a junior medic who was not familiar with the area."" Heat illness Ms Baldwin Jones said there was not enough awareness of JSP539 and guidance on interpreting it. ""That communication is vital because if you have a casualty, that could be heat illness, you should consider stopping the march,"" she added.

"The National Crime Agency has set up its third organised crime partnership in the region alongside collaborations with police in London and Scotland. It will feature a particular focus on exploitation and the dealing of hard drugs. Policing minister Kit Malthouse said the new scheme would ""dismantle"" gangs. Merseyside Police said it had seized more than £4m in cash from criminals in 2020, a record high for the force. Nikki Holland, the NCA's director of investigations, said: ""Along with other port cities and big urban conurbations, Merseyside is a location that has historically been targeted by criminals importing and supplying drugs and weapons."" She said the new partnership would build on the work of police to ""intercept"" and ""shut down"" so-called county lines drug dealing networks. The model involves urban gangs expanding their markets into smaller towns by setting up phone lines to help distribute their drugs, often with the help of children. Merseyside Police said it had shut down more than 150 county drug deal lines, arrested more than 700 offenders and protected more than 250 vulnerable children and adults from being exploited. Also, more than 90 people have been detained in Merseyside after a secret messenger platform called Encrochat was infiltrated in 2020.

"Nearly 1,000 staff members who were based in the 1970s-built Civic Centre moved into new offices in Bridge Street earlier.

All phone numbers remain the same. The council said the Civic Centre was ""at the end of its design life"" and was built using asbestos in some areas, which made it increasingly expensive to maintain. The 15-storey centre has now shut in preparation for demolition and the wider regeneration of the area. The Bridge Street offices, with three floors, is nearly half the size.

"Scientists at the Scottish Association for Marine Science (Sams) predict the cold water species will vanish from the west coast by the year 2100. The researchers suggest the fish are already nearing ""edge of their temperature tolerance range"". However, they add that global warming will see other species replace them. The Scottish government said it was following scientific advice on how to support Scotland's fishing industry. Cod, herring and haddock are commercially important species to Scotland. The researchers at Sams, which is near Oban and part of the University of the Highlands and Islands, warn that climate change could lead to the fish moving away to colder waters further north. 'Sustainable fisheries' But over the forthcoming decades these species would ""gradually be replaced by more abundant communities"" of saithe, hake and whiting, the scientists said. They said that from 1985 to 2013 the population of saithe and hake had increased four-fold off Scotland's west coast. Sams research has been published in the journal Scientific Reports. The paper's lead author, marine ecologist Dr Natalia Serpetti, said: ""These results highlight the importance of considering environmental change, as well as fishing quotas, to achieve sustainable fisheries management at an ecosystem level. ""We initially tested the impact of current advised fishing quotas, along with predator/prey interactions, within the ecosystem. ""Cod, whiting and herring stocks, that historically showed declining trends due to high fisheries exploitation and predation, recovered under a sustainable fishery management. ""However, we subsequently tested the impact of rising temperature under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) climate change scenarios, while keeping fishing rates consistent with current advised maximum sustainable yields, and found that there would be a collapse of cold water species stocks."" 'Stocks collapse' She added: ""Our results showed that warmer climate could jeopardise sustainable fishery management: rising temperature showed strong negative impact on cold water species such as grey seals, cod, haddock and herring, which all declined by 2100 under the worst case climate warming scenario. ""Even under the best case climate change scenario, cod and herring stocks were predicted to collapse off Scotland's west coast."" Dr Serpetti's research updated an existing marine model of the west coast of Scotland ecosystem, situated in the north-east Atlantic from the coastline to the edge of the continental shelf. Her model looked at how rising temperatures would affect 41 groups of species, from top predators such as whales and seals to many fish species and animals such as crabs and snails living on the sea floor. The research is part of the Marine Ecosystem Research Programme, funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Scottish government said it recognised that climate change was ""a major threat"" to Scotland's marine ecosystems and was following scientific advice to support a sustainable fishing industry. A spokesperson said: ""Scotland is recognised as being at the forefront of the global fight against climate change and continues to lead the UK in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ""To continue this progress, our Climate Change Plan and Energy Strategy will include the bold new commitments for low-carbon transport, infrastructure and energy efficiency that we set out in the Programme for Government, policies aimed at driving down emissions by 66% by 2032.""","Cod, herring and haddock could migrate away from Scotland's west coast waters because of warming sea temperatures, according to researchers."

"The UK prime minister cut short her holiday for talks at the French president's summer retreat. It came after UK Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab held talks with his counterparts in Paris on Thursday. Ahead of the talks, the UK's former ambassador to France warned Mrs May not to expect a Brexit breakthrough from the meeting. Lord Ricketts told the BBC that Mr Macron was ""the last person"" to want to break ranks with the rest of the EU to push for a softer stance from Brussels. Mr Macron ""doesn't believe in softening"" the position on Brexit as ""he is a passionate pro-European"", the peer said. The two leaders met at Mr Macron's summer residence in Fort de Brégançon, on a small island off the French Mediterranean coast. A cry for help? By BBC Paris Correspondent Lucy Williamson Mrs May's visit has been described in the French press as a ""cry for help"". The meeting with President Macron at his summer retreat - reportedly at her request - is seen as a bid to circumvent the European Commission and, according to the editorials here, exposes ""obvious"" British anxiety. The centre-right Le Figaro has a particularly colourful editorial which pictures Mrs May trying to wrest the steering wheel of the Brexit car from different factions of her party back home, as it ""jolts over the London potholes and skids on the oil slicks of Brussels"". Never mind ""take back control"" the paper says, Britain has lost control of Brexit. After Michel Barnier's chilly response to Mrs May's Brexit plan last month, this visit - which cuts short her summer walking holiday - is part of a charm offensive by the British government to see what progress can be made with individual European leaders. Many here in France believe the chance of a ""no deal"" Brexit is growing. But that pressure is unlikely to deliver the kind of concessions the prime minister would like. Mr Macron is a pragmatic man, but he has staked his presidency on a strong EU, and has so far stuck fast to core principles on the single market. France may show a little flexibility later in the game, one former French official told me, but not the kind of flexibility on which Britain is currently banking. After the hastily arranged talks, Mrs May and her husband, Philip, joined the president and his wife Brigitte for a five-course private dinner. They dined on tomatoes and saffron flavoured langoustines; thyme-flavoured sea bass; chicken with vegetables; cheese and finished with a choice of dark chocolate creme brulee or fruit. The prime minister ended her break in the Italian Lakes a day early for the talks, although she will fly to Switzerland for a second break later this month. Ahead of her meeting with Mr Macron, Mrs May spoke by phone to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker about Brexit and global trade. 'The biggest risk' On Thursday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier signalled a willingness to be flexible in Brexit negotiations around the Northern Ireland border. Calling the issue ""the biggest risk"" caused by Brexit, Mr Barnier said he was ""ready to improve"" the EU's proposals. The EU wants Northern Ireland to be part of a common regulatory area for goods and customs if a trade deal has not been reached by the end of the planned 21 month post-Brexit transition period - something the UK has rejected. Mr Barnier was also positive about reaching a free trade deal ""unprecedented in scope and depth"". He warned that any deal must not undermine free movement of goods, capital, services and labour within the EU single market by setting up free movement in goods only. But he added: ""I remain confident that the negotiations can reach a good outcome. ""It is possible to respect EU principles and create a new and ambitious partnership.""",Theresa May has met Emmanuel Macron as she stepped up her efforts to win backing for her Brexit plans.

"The prime minister said he appreciated people were ""disillusioned"" with the EU and he ""absolutely understood and received the message"". He told the BBC that only Conservatives offered a referendum on UK membership. The BBC's Nick Robinson said this ""simple message"" instilled confidence for many within the party. UKIP gained 23 MEPs, with the Tories having 19, behind Labour which has 20. The Conservative share of the vote was 23.9%, behind Labour on 25.4% and UKIP on 27.5%. Some Conservative MPs have expressed dismay at the performance and Mr Cameron said he was ""disappointed"" for the MEPs - including its former leader in Brussels Martin Callanan - who lost their seats. 'Clear message' But he said the vote reinforced his belief that the UK's relationship with the EU needed to change. ""I take a very clear message from the election. People are deeply disillusioned with the EU. They don't feel the current arrangements are working well enough for Britain and they want change. ""I would say that message is absolutely received and understood."" While he was an instinctive ""reformer"" who, in the referendum would ""give the choice to the British people of whether to stay or go"", Labour backed the ""status quo"" in Europe and the Lib Dems did not want any change. Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that UKIP's victory was a snub for the Westminster elite in general and for Mr Farage's different campaigning style, saying the UKIP leader was a ""consummate politician"" who was already discussing tactics for the 2015 general election. He again dismissed any talk of pre-election pacts, at either a national or constituency level, saying he was ""100%"" focused on delivering an outright Conservative victory. He said Labour had got a lower share of the vote in the 2004 European election and managed to comfortably win a general election the year after. ""It is possible to win from here,"" he said. ""We have just got to have a real focus on what really matters which is completing our economic plan and turning our country round."" Foreign Secretary William Hague said the rise of Eurosceptic parties should serve as a wake-up call to European politicians. 'Free hit' UKIP's support would switch for next year's general election, he told BBC News. ""They can have a free hit; they can have a vote that does not have the consequences of bringing the wrong government in,"" he said. ""So it is very different to a general election."" But backbencher Bernard Jenkin wrote on Twitter: ""Some of us who opposed Maastricht 20 years ago predicted it would lead to the rise of the right in the EU: and here we are."" And Clacton MP Douglas Carswell added: ""So maybe those of us who sometimes banged on about Europe were on to something?"" The European election results come just days after the Conservative Party lost more than 200 seats in local polls, prompting ministers to promise tougher curbs on immigration. Home Secretary Theresa May said they were considering deporting people who came to the UK to work, but who could not find a job after six months. They were also looking at cutting the length of time migrants could claim benefits from six months to three months, she said. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps said the election results were ""a command for Britain to get a better deal"" in Europe - but he rejected calls by Tory grandee David Davis to bring forward a proposed in/out EU referendum to 2016, saying negotiations on this could not be rushed.",David Cameron has insisted the Conservatives can win the next general election despite being pushed into third place in the European elections.
"Ovarian Cancer Action said the Scottish Medicines Consortium's decision on olaparib was ""ground-breaking"". The SMC approved the drug after hearing that patients tended to be younger women with family and work commitments. Cancer Research UK said trials have shown that olaparib can extend lives by an average of seven months. Olaparib is already approved for use in England for people who are suffering with cancer for a third time. In Scotland, it will be used by women who have relapsed with cancer for a second time. Clinical trials Katherine Taylor, chief executive of research charity Ovarian Cancer Action, said: ""The SMC's decision to approve the routine use of olaparib is ground-breaking; a huge leap towards more personalised treatment for women facing ovarian cancer because of a genetic mutation."" The drug targets ovarian cancer in women with a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 gene mutation. Last year Angelina Jolie had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after she was found to be at an increased risk of ovarian cancer due to a ""faulty"" BRCA 1 gene. Ms Taylor warned that women in Scotland would only qualify for olaparib if their BRCA status is known. She said: ""NHS Scotland must continue to make sure that all patients are offered a BRCA test at diagnosis so they can be treated with the best drugs available."" Gregor McNie, of Cancer Research UK in Scotland, said the charity was also funding clinical trials to asses the potential for olaparib in the treatment of brain tumours and pancreatic cancer. End of life He added: ""Cancer Research UK scientists played a pivotal role in discovering and developing olaparib and it is great news that the drug will now offer new hope to some women in Scotland with advanced disease. ""We look forward to further good news on olaparib in the future, with clinical trials showing it also has potential in other types of cancer."" Olaparib was approved by the SMC after being considered by its Patient Clinician Engagement (PACE) process which is used for medicines that treat end of life and very rare conditions. Prof Jonathan Fox, chairman of the SMC, said: ""As the first maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer, olaparib is an important development, and we know from the evidence given by patients and clinicians through our PACE process that it will be welcomed.""",Cancer charities have welcomed a decision to approve a new drug for treatment of a rare form of incurable ovarian cancer.
"The two-bedroom property in Haringey has a reception room, kitchen and bathroom, as well as a roof terrace. The terraced house is believed to have been built on a driveway between two homes and is due to be sold at auction on 1 October with a guide price of £235,000. The agents selling the house said it was ""very unique"". James McHugh, from McHugh & Co, said: ""It's a very unique house, to say the least, in a great location. ""The property would certainly appeal to an owner-occupier or rental investor."" In May, planning inspectors ruled that a 6ft (1.8m) wide house in Leyton, east London should be returned to its original use as a garage. The two-storey building, between terraced houses, was branded ""singularly out of place"" and ""wholly unsatisfactory"" by a planning inspector.","A north London house, believed to measure just 6 ft 11 inches (2.1m) wide has been put up for sale for £200,000."
"In a report, the cross-party Political and Constitutional Reform Committee said that the lobbying bill had been ""unnecessarily rushed"". The legislation failed to cover much of the lobbying industry, it said. But a Cabinet Office spokesman said the bill would improve transparency and boost public confidence in politics. Charities and other organisations have warned that the government's proposals to reform the lobbying industry, which include tighter rules on political spending, could hamper their work. 'Confusion' The Transparency of Lobbying, non-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Bill would set a £390,000 cap on the amount any organisation - excluding political parties - could spend across the UK during elections. But the committee of MPs said: ""We do not believe that the government has... provided a satisfactory account of the basis on which the new levels for registration and expenditure by third parties have been set."" Their report added: ""The definition of spending 'for electoral purposes' as currently drafted is likely to cause confusion."" The legislation will also create a statutory register of lobbyists, aiming to identify whose interests were being represented by consultant lobbyists and those who were paid to lobby on behalf of a third party. The committee argued that the register would ""exclude in-house lobbyists, which was the government's intention, but as currently drafted it would also exclude the vast majority of third-party lobbyists, and particularly the larger organisations"". Committee chairman and Labour MP Graham Allen said: ""This bill is an object lesson in how not to produce legislation. ""There was little or no consultation with those affected. There was no pre-legislative scrutiny. And the bill is now being rushed through the House in a way that indicates a lack of respect for Parliament. ""We can all agree on the need for transparency about lobbying and effective regulation of third-party spending. But this bill contains serious flaws."" 'Confidence' The committee concluded that the ""bill must not become law in its present form"" and called for the proposals to be withdrawn while a special committee is created to work on improving them. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""We welcome the fact that the committee agrees with the need for this legislation and we will of course consider the findings carefully and respond in due course. ""This bill is about creating even greater transparency in the way people and organisations interact with government and politics, to give the public more confidence in the way third parties interact with the political system."" Lobbying organisations ""play an important role in the political process, helping to inform policy making and ensuring views are heard by those in government"", he continued. ""This bill will ensure that we know who lobbyists lobby for; how much money is spent on third party political campaigning; and make sure trades unions know who their members are. ""We look forward to working with the opposition and others as the bill passes through Parliament to make sure we have a system that works in the long term."" The House of Commons approved the legislation in principle by giving it a second reading on Monday, with 309 votes in favour to 247 against - a reduced government majority. It will now undergo more detailed scrutiny from MPs.","The government's lobbying reforms are ""flawed"" and should be withdrawn for six months while they are improved, a committee of MPs has concluded."
"Riley Siswick was found dead at his home in Huddersfield in 2016 and his mother's boyfriend Kyle Campbell, 27, was later convicted of his murder. Riley's mother Kayleigh Siswick was also convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child. The review will examine the extent of contact between the boy's family and social services before his death. Kirklees Council said: ""This tragic case is the subject of a serious case review, commissioned by the Kirklees Safeguarding Children Board. ""It would not be appropriate for us to comment at this time however the review will be published later this year."" During the trial at Leeds Crown Court, the jury heard Riley was found dead in February 2016 two days after he had been hit by Campbell. The assault came ""either from a fist or by jumping or stamping on him or by striking him with an object"". The blow severed his bowel and causing peritonitis, which led to a ""slow and painful death"", the court heard. Campbell, of Heys View, Huddersfield was found guilty of murder and of causing or allowing the death of a child and two counts of causing actual bodily harm. He was jailed for life and will serve a minimum of 20 years. Siswick, 27, also of Heys View, was jailed for seven years.

"By Lucy AdamsBBC Scotland correspondent Aberdeen University's Prof Mohamed Abdel-fattah has published a correction to his original research paper almost seven years on. The change follows a complaint to the General Medical Council about him. The doctor who made the complaint said it was ""shocking"" the funding had not been declared at the time. Prof Abdel-fattah denied that there was any link between the funding and the study. Mesh implants are used by surgeons to treat conditions which some women suffer after childbirth. The synthetic mesh is used to repair damaged or weakened tissue in the woman's body. Many women have been left suffering chronic pain following the surgery. Tens of thousands of women across the UK have been given them over the past 20 years. However, the use of mesh in Scotland was suspended in all but ""exceptional circumstances"" in 2014 after it emerged some women had suffered painful side-effects. Prof Abdel-fattah was the lead clinician on a 2012 study that concluded that no patients were suffering thigh pain three years after their surgery. His study had compared two types of ""transobturator"" mesh tapes. In his original declaration Prof Abdel-fattah said funding, about £65,000, came from The Henry Smith Charity - but he did not mention the £100,000 received from the manufacturer of one of the devices used in the study, Coloplast. Figures show around 40,000 women across the UK have had the transobturator mesh procedure. It was the most commonly performed bladder surgery in Scotland and is also used in England. A complaint was made to the GMC in 2018 with allegations of research misconduct at various levels. Prof Abdel-fattah has now published a correction to his 2012 report admitting funding from the manufacturer but denied any link to ""any aspect of the study at any time from design to publication"". He said the research grant from Coloplast was ""inadvertently omitted"" from the original disclosure. The correction also contains a link to Prof Abdel-fattah's own declaration of interests. These include receiving money from a number of mesh manufacturers for being a consultant and trainer for mesh manufacturers including Ethicon and Coloplast. What is vaginal mesh? It is an implant used to treat incontinence and repair pelvic organ prolapse. The mesh - which can be synthetic or biological - can support the vaginal wall or internal organs. How many women have had the implants? It is estimated more than 100,000 women have had a mesh fitted in the UK. About 27,000 were in the past 10 years - but 211 women have had it removed. Why are some women angry? Some say the implant has caused them severe pain by cutting into internal tissue. More than 800 women are taking legal action against the NHS and mesh manufacturers over the mesh. However, the vast majority have suffered no side-effects. What do health bosses say? In Scotland, health boards were ordered to stop the use of implants last year. Health guidelines in England say women should only be offered mesh surgery as a last resort, or for research purposes. What are the alternatives to mesh? Physiotherapy and traditional surgery are also an option, depending on the severity of the problem. 'Highly influential' Dr Wael Agur, a consultant urogynaecologist and expert in mesh, made the original complaint to the GMC. He said Prof Abdel-fattah's study was ""highly influential"". Dr Agur said it was ""shocking"" that the funding from Coloplast had not been declared at the time. He said: ""This study had reassured us seven years ago that the use of mesh is safe - so we continued using it. ""Now we find out that the researchers had received £100,000 from the mesh manufacturers. Why was this money never declared at the time? ""The women trusted us to do the right thing and we thought at the time that we were doing the right thing."" 'Life ruined by mesh' Lorna Farrell had transobturator mesh fitted in 2008. She says she now lives in constant pain and uses a wheelchair to get about. She says her life has been ""ruined"" by mesh. Lorna told BBC Scotland: ""We need to have research into it but how can it be that the research is part-funded by the manufacturers? ""If they want to fund research why don't they speak to those who have been damaged by what they have done."" Restricted use The GMC said it could not comment on individual cases. But the BBC understands a failure to declare funding from a pharmaceutical company in a research study could potentially raise an allegation about the fitness to practise of a doctor. A statement from Aberdeen University said: ""Prof Abdel-fattah has been informed by the GMC that they looked into a complaint made against him but the investigation has now been closed as of December 2018. ""Neither Prof Abdel-fattah nor the university are aware of any further ongoing investigation."" The statement added: ""The GMC did not ask him to make the amendment to the paper, he did so of his own volition in the interests of increased transparency. ""The amendment clearly stated that Coloplast had no input to the study in any form and at any stage."" The university pointed out that transobturator tapes had been the most common procedure of this sort worldwide since at least 2009. The use of mesh in Scotland has been controversial. It has been used hundreds of times since the partial suspension in 2014. Last year, transabdominal mesh was cited as an underlying factor in the death of a Scottish woman and the Scottish government called for an immediate halt to its use until a new ""restricted use protocol"" is drawn up. NHS England has also recently curbed the use of mesh on safety grounds, although it is still available as a treatment of last resort for some.","A high-profile academic has admitted he failed to declare £100,000 from the manufacturer making one of the types of vaginal mesh implant he was assessing."
"An estimated 20% of the population are disabled, but only 1.5% of councillors are known to have a disability. Disability Wales said more should be done to remove barriers to people standing to improve representation. The Welsh Government said it was committed to tackling under-representation in public life. Disability Wales said about 600,000 people in Wales have a disability, but very few councils hold data on how many councillors are disabled. BBC research showed of the 1,254 councillors elected in May, just 19 are known by local authorities to be living with an impairment or long-term health condition. Anita Davies, a councillor for Coity Higher Community Council in Bridgend, is registered blind and said people often made prejudgements on her ability to do her job. She said she had sat in meetings where no-one introduced themselves or read out presentations, and she had not been sent important documents in the right format to make a decision. ""If I've got my cane with me and I'm on my own, some people will actually avoid talking to me because they are not quite sure what to say or how to introduce themselves,"" she said. ""[If I'm with a resident at a meeting] sometimes they think I'm a relative... the last thing they would have thought of is that I may be a councillor, because I have a visual impairment."" Conservative AM for north Wales, Mark Isherwood, who is partially deaf and chairman of the assembly's group on disability, said he purposely wore large standard NHS hearing aids so people could see. ""When my hearing started deteriorating I was the last person to admit it, I had a bit of an experience where people assumed I was stupid,"" he said, ""I now wear it to make a statement, I am deaf but I am proud of it."" Disability Wales said people were being barred from accessing democracy due to meetings often being held in buildings which lack hearing loops or ramps. Council chambers such as City Hall in Cardiff are listed buildings and are difficult to adapt for people with mobility issues, but many councils said they had improved facilities and provided support to help accessibility. A Disability Wales spokeswoman said: ""Disabled people are being prevented from entering public life due to negative, archaic stereotyping by members of the public. ""We are perceived as not being fit for the job due to having an impairment or health condition. In fact, these lived experiences bring us vital qualities needed for public life; empathy, problem solving and objectivity."" The organisation called for the Welsh Government to introduce a version of the Access to Elected Office Fund - introduced in Scotland for the local elections in 2017 - to help disabled people who want to stand for election with the costs. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""While the Access to Elected Office Fund did not extend to Welsh elections, we are currently considering options for establishing a similar fund for Wales as part of our ongoing work to promote diversity amongst elected members.""","Disabled people are being blocked from politics in Wales due to ""negative, archaic stereotyping"" and inaccessible buildings, campaigners have said."
"Data from the Church in Wales showed 115 Anglican churches have closed over a 10-year period, about 8% of the total, with 1,319 still in use. There are currently 11 properties advertised for sale on the church's website. The Church in Wales said closures were a ""significant issue"" and while the sale rate had stayed steady, it was unlikely to slow down. Head of property, Alex Glanville, said there was a move to take a regional look at churches rather than let each one deal with the issue on its own. ""We're grouping a lot more parishes and congregations together, about 10-15 churches in an area, and thinking which ones can we sustain. ""There's a little bit more strategy - what's a sustainable congregation and where's the best place to do it?"" The National Churches Trust said the rate of closures in Wales was relatively higher than England, given relative population size, where about 20 close each year. Mr Glanville said one of the issues in Wales was a large number of buildings in very small communities, along with a lot of ""very remote places"" and falling church attendance. The last census revealed Wales had the highest number of people with no religion in the UK. He added: ""A smaller congregation doesn't necessarily mean a church closing. People are innovative and think of many ways to get the church to perform a different function in the community."" A recent survey carried out by the National Churches Trust for places of worship in Wales - including non-conformist denominations, Catholic churches and Church in Wales properties - found the biggest problem facing them was falling congregations and attracting new worshippers. They identified attracting more people into the building and introducing new facilities as key to helping them stay open. The trust's head of communications, Eddie Tulasiewicz, said he believed chapels were closing at the rate of about one a week, but the number of denominations made it hard to be exact. He said the future for under-threat buildings depended on factors including location and population size, but admitted there was ""no future for some buildings"". ""What may have been built in the 19th Century for a population of 6,000 to 10,000 people has shrunk to 2,000 or 3,000 and there's no one left to go there. ""The thing is to think about what can be done with these buildings over and above their religious purpose. They can hold meetings; concerts can take place. ""The other thing is history and tourism. A lot of churches and chapels are exceedingly beautiful and people do want to visit them."" National Churches Trust is among the bodies that award grants to help renovation projects, giving out £500,000 in Wales in the past five years.","More than 10 churches a year are closing in Wales, figures have shown."
"Ms Williams accused the force of ""racially profiling"" her and her partner when they were handcuffed and separated from their baby son in July. Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick apologised to the athlete after footage of their car being stopped went online. The Met referred itself to the police watchdog. Scotland Yard said the force would improve its ""training, policy and processes"" following the review, which makes 10 recommendations. Ms Williams welcomed the plan for new training, but said further ""effective"" racial bias training was also needed. ""The handcuffs were painful and it was incredibly humiliating to be separated from my baby, in handcuffs outside my home with neighbours walking past,"" she said. ""While I welcome better training in the Met on the use of handcuffs, the trauma of the incident did not start or end with the handcuffing. It was racial stereotyping and prejudice. ""I would like to see some effective bias training in the police as well as better training on the use of force and not just in relation to handcuffs."" The Met said it will now develop a specific policy on handcuffing pre-arrest ""that will set out clear guidance for officers, including the requirement to justify any initial application of handcuffs as well as their continued use during an interaction."" Recommendations included ""additional legal training, extended officer safety and improved personal safety training for police officers, de-escalation tactics and more community input to understand the respective experiences of each during encounters"". The Met has also amended its stop and search e-form to include any use and justification for handcuffs pre-arrest. 'Extremely corrosive' Deputy assistant commissioner Matt Twist, who led the review, said: ""Ensuring the trust and confidence of the public is reliant upon the quality of our interactions and our communication before, during and after any stop where handcuffs are believed by officers to be needed."" The review included consultations with young black men, aged between 16 and 25, as well as frontline officers. It found that searches of the same people, where nothing is found, are ""extremely corrosive to the person's and wider communities' trust and confidence in policing"". ""The public are concerned that the use of handcuffs can be degrading and, whilst accepting there is a place for it, handcuffs should not be the first resort, and more effort should be made in communication and explanation that might make the use of handcuffs unnecessary,"" it said.

"About 1,000 protesters took part after protesters claimed selling the 200-year-old Cowbridge cattle market site for housing would be ""devastating"". They say it will be bad for businesses and would force farmers to make a 90 mile round-trip to Abergavenny market. The Vale of Glamorgan council, which owns the site, said it is consulting on plans to build houses there. The council said it would then allocate land at nearby St Mary Hill for a new, replacement cattle market. Farmers, local businesses and residents joined the protest, which starts at the town hall on Friday afternoon before moving to the cattle market. The market has been in Cowbridge for over 200 years, with farmers selling their livestock there every Tuesday. But during the rest of the week its operators, who lease the site from the council, open up the site for the public to use its car parking spaces. Cowbridge Chamber of Trade said that businesses are worried that the loss of these spaces will mean visitors to the town will struggle to park - and they will go elsewhere. ""The market is a huge part of what Cowbridge is about - it's a market town,"" said chamber of trade chair Alun John. ""And it does bring in a certain amount of trade on Tuesdays, which is a quiet day. ""But the big issue for us is the loss of the 200 car parking spaces. Lack of car parking is already a big problem in the town. ""We've already got restaurants saying they have had people cancelling, saying they can't park. That's not unusual."" Mr John added: ""The council has outlined another site but there seems to be no will from the council to invest any of the money they will get from the sale of the current site."" He said he hoped the demonstration would force the council to re-think the plans. Dave Harris, local NFU Cymru group secretary, said: ""Our members are up in arms about the proposal to sell off Cowbridge cattle market,"" he said. ""This market has been here for about 200 years and if it goes farmers and animals will have to travel a 90 mile round-trip to the nearest market in Abergavenny. ""Once it's gone it will be gone forever."" 'Feedback awaited' The Vale council said it had been ""progressing work"" on the local development plan for the county, which seeks to plan the way land is used for the next 15 years. It said that along with new housing, it planned to create "" a scheme to provide for public car parking"". ""The responses to the consultation on the local development plan will be carefully considered,"" a spokesperson said. ""The leader of the council held a meeting late last year with farming representatives and other interested parties on the future of a cattle market in the Vale of Glamorgan. ""Feedback is still awaited from those representatives that attended the meeting. ""The leader is a strong supporter of the farming community and is committed into appropriate and meaningful discussion with interested parties on the future of the site.""",A demonstration has been held over the planned closure of a livestock market at Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan.
"Deputy mayor Beverley Hughes said recent testing had revealed the stronger strain and drug abuse support professionals had been ""alerted"". The warning came after a drug testing machine developed by Manchester Metropolitan University was placed at a Manchester city centre police station. Greater Manchester Police said the scheme is the first of its kind. Strains of Spice in circulation are monitored by the Greater Manchester Drug Alert Panel, which combines input from agencies including the police and the NHS. Ms Hughes said: ""Tackling the use of Spice is very complex and there is no easy or single solution. ""However, the work of the panel enables the police, the city council and partner organisations to respond quickly and we are doing all we can to combat the problem and get the drug off our streets."" Police and MMU have been working together on tackling the effects of psychoactive substances for the past 18 months. The new machine analyses substances within an hour, and allows the information to be sent to police officers and healthcare workers. Supt Chris Hill said it would allow police to test unknown substances ""as quickly as possible"" and react speedily if there was ""an ongoing danger or threat"". He added: ""It's really important that we have all of the information possible so that we can continue to tackle the drug issues across Greater Manchester but also work with partners to keep people safe.""","A new ""more dangerous batch"" of Spice is being sold on the streets of Greater Manchester, authorities have warned."

Aircraft Carrier Alliance (ACA), which operates the ship, said the sea trials would be testing the vessel's radar and communications systems, power and propulsion as well as monitoring air flow patterns around the flight deck. Captain of Portsmouth Naval Base, Capt Bill Oliphant said the trials were an ""extremely significant milestone"" in the life of the ship.

"By John Campbell & Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI The move was announced by the Department of Finance, as part of a reallocation exercise known as a monitoring round. The health service has been given an additional £40m of funding that will be used to address ""inescapable"" cost pressures and tackle waiting lists. The education department gets £10m and the Department of the Economy gets £1m. The five health and social care trusts had been told they had to make savings of £70m. A public consultation into which services could be cut closed last week. It is understood that draft savings plans into the remaining £30m of cuts are still to be considered at trust board meetings on Friday. The Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said the additional £40m announced by the Department of Finance will allow it to stand down almost all of its major and controversial proposals. The Department of Health said the money is hugely welcomed and will help towards reducing the amount of savings needed. But in a statement a spokesperson said the financial issues it faces this year will only ""grow in intensity as we move forward"". Avoid adverse impact The Department for Infrastructure gets an additional £11.2m in capital spending in the funding reallocation, mainly to repair damage caused by flooding in the north-west last month. That department also gets an extra £3m for day-to-day spending. The Department of Finance said the reallocation of funds was in line with the powers granted to the department's permanent secretary under the Northern Ireland Act. The proposed allocations will need to be reflected in a Budget Bill, whether it is passed by a new Northern Ireland Executive or a direct rule minister at Westminster. The departments are being told of the proposed allocations now to avoid any adverse impact on services. Stormont has not passed a budget for this financial year due to the collapse of the executive in January, so civil servants have been operating emergency procedures. Last month, the Northern Ireland secretary warned that time was running out for the parties to reach an agreement. ""If this does not happen within a short number of weeks, we risk greater political decision-making from Westminster, starting with provision for a 2017-18 budget this autumn,"" said James Brokenshire.",Health and education are to benefit from the reallocation of money across Stormont departments.
"Mr McVeigh, 19, from County Tyrone, was one of 16 murder victims known as the Disappeared, who were killed and secretly buried by republicans. Despite numerous searches, three of the victims have not been found. They are Joe Lynskey, Mr McVeigh and Capt Robert Nairac. Excavators are returning to Bragan Bog near Emyvale, County Monaghan, to resume the search for Mr McVeigh, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR) said. Mr McVeigh, from Donaghmore, was kidnapped in November 1975. The most recent search took place for the teenager's remains at a section of Bragan Bog last September and was temporarily stopped in November. Several previous searches in the bog have not uncovered his remains. At the scene Julian Fowler, BBC News NI South West Reporter The latest search at Bragan Bog began last September and was temporarily stopped in November, as the weather closed in. Investigators from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains have identified an area of about an acre where they believe Columba McVeigh was buried. They are about halfway through the search. The weather conditions and the difficulties of the terrain means investigators have not put a timescale on their efforts - they will stay as long as it takes to complete the search. Jon Hill, senior investigator with the ICLVR, said it had taken some time for the bog to dry out sufficiently to enable the use of machinery for Tuesday's search. ""We've managed to do some preparatory work in advance of today and so we're able to get down to the search proper straight away,"" he added. ""As I explained back in September we are searching an area of about one acre in total, which is smaller than some we have worked on in previous Disappeared searches but this is challenging terrain."" Mr Hill said he would not put ""a precise time frame"" on how long it would be at the site. ""Obviously our hope is that we find Columba at an early stage but as ever we'll have to wait to see,"" he said. ""What I can absolutely guarantee is that the highly skilled contractors and forensic archaeologists working here will do everything they humanly can to get the result that we all know will mean so much to the McVeigh family and all those who support them."" Last month, it emerged a reward of almost £50,000 is being offered for new information that results in finding the bodies of the Disappeared. The anonymous donation of $60,000 (£47,191) has been given to the independent UK charity Crimestoppers. Crimestoppers takes calls anonymously by telephone or accepts information through an anonymous online form. It says any information that it receives will be passed only to the Independent Commission for the Location of the Victims' Remains (ICLVR).

The authority said AEW's lease stated the seafront arena ""should be in use at all times."" 'Strong demand' AEW, which previously said the rink was not ""financially viable"", has put the arena up for sale at £3.5m or rent of £140,000 a year. The Raiders, the island's only ice hockey club, said since the rink's closure the team had been forced to fold. In a statement, the team's manager, Geoff Underwood, said ""There is a very strong community demand for the rink. ""Ice hockey is only one sport that relies on the rink, but The Raiders organisation will do everything we can to help get the rink back into use. ""I sincerely wish that AEW could see the damage that they have done to our community, and come to their senses."" AEW UK has not yet responded to a BBC request for a comment.","A debt-ridden ice rink which has been closed for almost a year will reopen, councillors have vowed."
"Thousands of people developed Hepatitis C and HIV after being given infected blood in the late 70s and 80s. In 2015, the Welsh Government announced extra financial support for patients who had received contaminated blood. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said only the UK government had the power and the information to hold an inquiry. In Wales, 280 people were infected, leading to 70 deaths. 'Black cloud' David Thomas, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, was infected with Hepatitis C after being given contaminated blood products as a teenager in the 1980s. He said it has put a ""black cloud over my life"" for the last 20 years since he was diagnosed. ""Your access to things like life insurance is denied and the compensation that has been offered by the government to date has been adequate at best,"" he told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. Mr Thomas said he was given a one-off payment of £20,000 in 1990 and a recent revision of the scheme means he receives £3,500 annually, but maintains this is ""not enough"". ""There is a possibility... I could develop cirrhosis so you have to change your lifestyle,"" he said. ""Some people are forced out of work due to ill health and are scrabbling around for charity payments when really they should be having meaningful compensation."" He said he ""fully endorsed"" the calls for a public enquiry, adding: ""I think it's the only way we will get to the truth."" What is Hepatitis C? What is cirrhosis? Source: NHS Labour AM for Cardiff North, Julie Morgan, who is chairwoman of the cross-party group on haemophilia and contaminated blood, raised the issue in the Senedd on Wednesday. She said UK government support for patients was ""not sufficient"" and a £10,000 payment to families of someone who had received contaminated blood and since died was ""totally inadequate"". ""I think that the haemophilia community wants to know why this happened, why blood transfusions weren't stopped when it was well known at that time that there was a real risk of contaminated blood, why did documents go missing? ""There are a lot of questions to be answered and I don't think this issue will ever be laid to rest until there is a full blown public inquiry."" Mr Gething told AMs he backed the call for a UK inquiry, saying: ""Only the UK government has access to the information, and the powers for the scope and the depth of an inquiry that is required to help people to get to the truth."" Last January, the UK government proposed increasing the amount of money on offer for those affected. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ""The department is more than doubling its annual spend on the scheme for people affected by this tragedy so that we can provide an annual payment to all infected individuals for the first time.""","The ""tainted blood"" scandal which led to the deaths of 70 people in Wales should be the subject of a UK public inquiry, a group of AMs has said."
"The National will now rename the Cottesloe Theatre after their benefactor, whose gift will kickstart the £70m redevelopment of the Grade-II listed building. Hayden Phillips, the National's chairman, described the donation as a ""supremely generous gift"". The money he hoped would act as an ""inspiration to other philanthropists"". Mr Dorfman described himself as a ""huge fan of the energy and innovation the National has achieved in recent years"". He said he was delighted ""to lead from the front in supporting its redevelopment"". 'Faith in the arts' The theatre hopes some of the rebuild will be completed by 2013 but a spokeswoman could not say when the project would be finished. It had hoped to raise £50m from the private sector and £20m from other sources like the the National Lottery. The design, by architects Haworth Tompkins, includes plans to refurbish the theatre on all sides, drawing more people in with green spaces and gardens. The building will also feature a new education centre, allowing an extra 50,000 people a year to engage in learning and training activities at the theatre. Mr Phillips said the donation was the largest ever made to the National Theatre. ""I hope it will also act as a spur and inspiration to other philanthropists, as a powerful demonstration of faith in the performing arts,"" he added. First opened in March 1977, the Cottesloe is the smallest of the National's three auditoriums. It takes its name from Lord Cottesloe, chairman of the South Bank Theatre board and a one-time head of the Arts Council.",The founder of Travelex Lloyd Dorfman has donated £10m to the National Theatre.
"The Scottish government says patients should not wait longer than six weeks for one of eight key diagnostic tests. The latest statistics showed that only 78.7% of patients were seen within this timeframe between March and June this year. This compares with 80.6% in March 2018 and 82.9% a year ago. The figure stood at 92.2% two years ago. The six-week standard applies to tests including endoscopies, colonoscopies, MRI and CT scans - which are often used to detect cancer. The NHS report said the latest figures showed an ""increasing trend in the number of patients waiting longer than six weeks over the past two years"". It said a total of 87,482 people were waiting for one of the eight diagnostic tests at 30 June - of whom 18,644 had been waiting longer than six weeks. This represents an increase of 300% on the 4,750 patients who had to wait longer than six weeks in June 2016. Recovery chances The overall decrease in performance was largely due to a sharp increase in average waiting times for endoscopies, with only 56.6% of people waiting for an endoscopy being seen within six weeks. An endoscopy procedure involves a tiny camera on a long, thin, flexible tube being passed into the body. These procedures are often used to detect bowel cancers. Cancer charities have warned that early detection can be crucial to a patient's chances of recovery, with Cancer Research UK saying the statistics suggest that the NHS in Scotland ""does not have enough staff to be as effective as possible in diagnosing cancer"". The charity also said the figures were particularly concerning as demand for tests was only going to grow due to an ageing population and efforts to diagnose more people at an early stage. Can't find your health trust? Browse the full list Rather search by typing? Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker, click or tap here. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the Scottish government had recently invested £6m in efforts to reduce waiting times for endoscopies, with a focus on the most urgent patients, including those with suspected cancer. Other NHS statistics released on Tuesday showed that the percentage of patients being seen within the legally-binding 12 weeks for planned inpatient and day care treatment had fallen to a new low. The figures said 74.6% of patients were seen within the 12-week treatment time guarantee (TTG) in the three months to June, compared with 75.8% during the previous quarter and 81.2% in the same period last year. This is the lowest since the TTG was introduced in 2012 and a sharp drop from the 92.7% of eligible patients who were seen within the 12-week TTG in March 2016. The TTG gives patients a legal right to treatment within 12 weeks for conditions such as knee and eye operations. The statistics also showed: Scottish Labour claimed that the figures revealed ""the pressure our health service is under thanks to years of SNP mismanagement"". But the Scottish government pointed to research which suggests hospital patients continue to rate the care they receive very highly. In the latest Inpatient Experience Survey, 20,000 people answered a range of questions covering topics such as hospital environment, staff and operations. The results showed that 86% rated their full experience positively, with more than a third of people giving their care full marks. Ms Freeman said: ""NHS investment and staffing are at historically high levels, and the record high inpatient satisfaction rates published today are a testament to the hard work of our frontline NHS staff."" She also said the government was introducing a package of measures, including £50m of additional funding to reduce long waits for treatment.",The number of NHS patients in Scotland who have to wait longer than they should for crucial medical tests has continued to grow.

"Royal Tank Regiment corporals Matthew Hatfield, 27, and Darren Neilson, 31, died in the blast in Castlemartin, Pembrokeshire, in June 2017. A seal to stop explosive gases escaping into the crew turret of the tank was not in place, the inquest heard. Two other soldiers survived the blast with injuries. Army training officer Sergeant Alexander Ahtom told the hearing he was ""not aware of any former incident like this before"" and he ""never thought it possible"". Even during high-tempo combat operations in Iraq, this type of incident had never occurred, the inquest heard on Tuesday. But the tank specialist agreed with Senior Coroner for Birmingham and Solihul, Louise Hunt, that a ""misunderstanding"" was possible when a new crew took over a tank. Both Cpl Neilson, a father of one from Preston, and Cpl Hatfield from Wiltshire, were highly-trained gunnery instructors and were taking a soldier out on a ""guest shoot"", the inquest heard. Their tank had been used by a previous crew earlier that morning, before the four soldiers took it to the firing area in the afternoon. The bolt vent axial (BVA) seal was not present and ammunition may have been ""incorrectly stowed"", the inquest was told. Sgt Ahtom said there was no regulation in place to recheck the Challenger 2 tank barrels after use, but ""absolutely no-one"" raised this circumstance as a concern. But in the previous six weeks, training procedures were changing to include a frequent gun-proving drill, which rechecked the tank barrel and the BVA seal, the inquest heard. 'Direct action in Iraq' Sgt Ahtom told senior coroner Ms Hunt that he was ""concerned"" that people were not doing the gun-proving drill as expected. Simon Antrobus QC, representing tank-maker BAE, said that ""a whole series of rigorous development trials to look at reliability, firing and manoeuvres"" had been conducted. ""During which thousands of rounds were fired and it saw direct action in Iraq against Iraqi tanks,"" he added. Sgt Ahtom also said that he ""completely"" disagreed with the Ministry of Defence (MoD) joint service inquiry panel's conclusion into the blast. The panel proposed that it could be possible to miss that the airtight seal was not present if checking for another key part. The inquest, which is set to last three weeks, continues.","An explosion that killed two soldiers in a British Army tank had never happened in the history of the model's 20 year service, an inquest was told."
"A report for Gwynedd council's language committee provides an update on a ""language champions scheme"" and the use of Welsh at leisure centres in Bangor, Tywyn and Dolgellau. It says some staff lacked confidence or were reluctant to use Welsh. Cllr Louise Hughes, from Llanegryn, near Tywyn, said: ""You cannot force people into how they speak"". The report concentrates on the language champions scheme in leisure centres in Welsh-speaking areas. It says the ""situation has improved at the Bangor and Tywyn Centres,"" adding that ""11 out of the 30 members of staff at Bangor were attending lessons and attempting to speak more Welsh, and it is reported that more Welsh is also being spoken at the Tywyn centre, where the manager can now follow the discussion through the medium of Welsh at meetings"". It says ""problems continue"" at Dolgellau Leisure Centre where ""some members of staff lack confidence or are reluctant to use the Welsh language, despite efforts to persuade them to at least greet customers in Welsh"". It adds: ""The department is continuing to press on staff who are reluctant to use the Welsh language, and consideration will be given to disciplinary measures in some circumstances."" A council spokesman said no action had yet been taken and the local authority was trying to comply with legislation passed in 2011 which states people living in Wales should be able to live their lives through the medium of Welsh if they choose. Louise Hughes, an independent councillor in Llanegryn, said: ""I'm reminded of the situation when they insisted that a seasonal litter-picker should speak Welsh, which led to the beach at Aberdyfi being un-swept for two years. ""My Welsh is reasonable but some who are not fluent are made to feel second class."" She added: ""We now live in a multi-cultural society. Things cannot be preserved in aspic and you cannot force people into how they speak.""",Disciplinary action could be taken against council leisure centre staff who do not greet customers in Welsh.
"The former Wham! star was moved out of Pentonville Prison on Friday after abandoning plans to apply for bail. The 47-year-old, whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou, moved to Highpoint Prison in Suffolk. The singer was jailed on Tuesday for eight weeks after crashing his Range Rover while under the influence of cannabis. Michael was found slumped at the wheel of a car after it smashed into a branch of Snappy Snaps photo store in Hampstead, north London, in July. The singer admitted driving while unfit through drugs and possessing two cannabis cigarettes when he appeared at London's Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in August. Michael, who had a previous conviction for the same offence, was told by District Judge John Perkins there was no option but jail. On Friday, a bail application on his behalf was cancelled. Michael is expected to serve four weeks in prison. Pentonville Prison, where former inmates have included Oscar Wilde and fellow 1980s singer Boy George, houses close to 1,000 male convicts. A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the department did not discuss the movement of prisoners.",Jailed pop star George Michael has been transferred to a softer Category C prison.
"RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) Ltd has been given until 15 June to reduce the pile in Brierley Hill to no higher than 8m (26.25ft). A way forward acceptable to both parties has been agreed, Sanders & Co, law firm for the company, said. The agency said it was pleased with the outcome after a High Court hearing. An agreement which was made during informal talks was ratified at the hearing in Birmingham on Thursday. Residents claim the pile, made up of household and industrial refuse, is a health hazard. The agency said it was about 13m (42.65ft) high. It had planned to get a High Court injunction preventing the firm from bringing any more rubbish on to the site in the Black Country. A directions hearing has been scheduled for 18 June to ensure the agreement has been complied with. Environment manager for the agency David Hudson said: ""We now have a timetable for reducing the waste on the site.

"The 21-year-old's body was found in the Humber estuary on Wednesday, seven weeks after she went missing following a night out on 1 February. Detectives said she could have been killed but ""would not be releasing results of a post-mortem examination for investigative reasons"". Det Supt Martin Smalley said ""one man remains under investigation"". He said: ""In regards to our investigation, while we have considered throughout the missing person inquiry that Libby may have come to some harm, Libby's death and the recovery of her body now leads us to solely investigate as a potential homicide. ""The post-mortem examination concluded late last night and at this stage, we will not be releasing any results for investigative and operational reasons."" An inquest into her death is due to open and adjourn on Monday. Det Supt Smalley said specially trained officers were continuing to support Ms Squire's family. ""Our thoughts remain today with Libby's family and friends at this incredibly sad and devastating time for them,"" he said. ""Libby captured the hearts of not just the people in Hull, but across the country, and as I have said before, the support shown has been overwhelming and my sincerest thanks to absolutely everyone who has been involved."" Libby's body was recovered at around 15:30 GMT on Wednesday close to Spurn Point and taken to Grimsby Docks. A major police inquiry saw hundreds of officers and about 50 detectives search for the student. On the night of her disappearance, police believe Ms Squire got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house in Wellesley Avenue at about 23:30 on 31 January, where her mobile phone was found. They think she did not enter the house and have said her phone ""has not provided any further insight as to her movements that night"". She was spotted on CCTV 10 minutes later near a bench on Beverley Road, where it is thought a motorist stopped to offer her help. The bench has become a focal point for those wishing to remember Ms Squire, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and floral tributes have been left at the site.","The death of Hull student Libby Squire is being treated as ""a potential homicide"", Humberside Police has said."
"They will walk out from 1000 to 1800 on Saturday 23 October and Monday 1 November after 79% of Fire Brigades' Union (FBU) members voted for action. They say the dispute centres on plans to scrap current rotas and force staff to sign new contracts or face the sack. London Fire Brigade said changes were needed so that the public would remain protected while budgets were squeezed. The union had given managers until Friday afternoon to drop their proposals. 'Hate being bullied' FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said the union was ""ready to talk, but not to be bullied"". ""Lift the sackings now and there will be no strike in London,"" he told managers. But Brian Coleman, who chairs the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, called on the FBU to ""stop blocking"" the changes, which were first put forward five years ago. ""Firefighters are going to be striking over plans to reduce a 15-hour night shift by three hours, and add those three hours to a nine-hour day shift."" ""That is all these proposals seek to do - no station closures, no increase in hours and no change to the four-day rest period between shifts. ""This is about making more time in the day for vital training and fire-prevention work.""",Firefighters in London are to stage two eight-hour strikes in a row over proposed changes to working practices.
"Cars from ""all over the country"" were in gridlock in Devon, police said. In Cornwall, Perranporth beach had hundreds of people on it, while the warm weather also brought people out to Southend seafront in Essex. In Merseyside, people visited Sefton's beaches despite pleas to stay away, and there was a reported 40-minute queue for a toilet in Skegness. In Devon, Saunton Sands beach car park, near Braunton, was described as ""looking like August"", with nearby Woolacombe described as ""a particular pinch point"" for traffic. Police warned motorists against abandoning cars elsewhere, saying they should follow advice to avoid becoming trapped on narrow lanes. Public toilets and other amenities in the area remained closed, drivers were reminded. In Sefton, footage filmed by a resident in Formby showed large numbers of cars parked on a residential road as people headed to the nearby beach, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Sefton Council said its message was for people to stay away as spaces were unable to cope with a high level who could ""put each other, our local communities and council staff at risk"" of spreading and catching coronavirus. And despite calls to keep people away from Lincolnshire's beaches, the sole open disabled toilet at Skegness saw a 40-minute-long queue. In Norfolk the Hunstanton Coastguard Rescue Team said there had been more than 30 rescues in the past two days. They included a family of three being cut off by the tide at Brancaster on Wednesday afternoon. One Devon police officer said the area's elderly population would be ""very anxious over the selfish actions of these individuals"". Another officer said vehicles were parked on double yellow lines between Woolacombe and Mortehoe and cars mounted pavements ""to get by whilst pedestrians try to cross the road"".

Some Perranporth visitors told the BBC they were from Liverton in Devon, about 80 miles (130km) away; while others said they travelled from Plymouth, 55 miles (90km) away. Tourism bosses in Cornwall and Devon were united in saying visitors should ""stay away"" as Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were eased in England. Under the new guidelines, households are able to drive to other destinations in England, such as parks and beaches. However, tourism body Visit Devon said people should restrict journeys ""to no more than one hour and only visit our region for short day trips"" as the county's rural communities ""lacked the infrastructure and NHS facilities to be able to cope with an influx"" of coronavirus cases. Devon and Cornwall Police Commissioner Alison Hernandez said such travel was not illegal but people were being encouraged to ""come back later, just not yet"".",Beaches across England have been seeing high numbers of visitors apparently defying coronavirus concerns.
"In a Facebook post for which he later apologised, Jon Wright claimed that caring for a newborn would prevent one candidate, Labour's Catherine Atkinson from being ""a voice for the people"". But in 2015-17, women made up 29% of all MPs, and about 30% of candidates for the coming general election are women - a record high. Many of these women have or are likely to have young families - so what is it like to run for office with a newborn? The BBC spoke to two politicians about juggling briefing books and breast pumps. 'He was sick in my hair' Clifford may well be the youngest baby on the campaign trail. His mum, Andrea Jenkyns, became the Conservative MP for Morley and Outwood in 2015, famously ousting Ed Balls who was then shadow chancellor. She gave birth to Clifford, her first son, in March, but what she didn't know was that just three weeks later, a general election would be called. While people were adjusting to the idea of another election, Andrea was suddenly faced with the task of defending her seat while caring for her baby. Life with a newborn is hectic for any parent - new babies can need feeding every two hours, and there's also the sleep deprivation. Most new mums spend this time on maternity leave, but this is no longer an option for Andrea who needs to campaign if she wants to be re-elected. Her fiance, Jack Lopresti, is also an MP but they spend long hours apart as he lives 200 miles away in his constituency of Filton and Bradley Stoke. ""The biggest challenge was going into election mode when he was three weeks old, I was recovering from my Caesarean that I had to have due to complications and was still taking morphine for the pain,"" Andrea told the BBC. Campaigning in a general election means gruelling and physically demanding days - there are voters to meet, doors to knock on and speeches to give. You may also like: Andrea has managed to take baby Clifford to some events, including the Conservative manifesto launch in Bradford where he met Theresa May, and when she is delivering leaflets. ""The funniest moment was when the prime minister was due to visit a business in my constituency, and an hour before, I was winding Clifford and he was sick in my hair! ""People are always keen to meet Clifford and he always gets a warm reaction, people also say hello and one little four-year-old girl asked for a photo with him. ""I've also been canvassing on the doorstep when people have asked how he is doing, which is really lovely,"" she explained. ""Seeing my little boy's beautiful face and the way it lights up when he smiles has kept me going through the tiredness and sleepless nights. ""Being a mother is an absolute real joy.""

""In a politician's life when an election happens everything stops,"" her mum Tulip Siddiq, the Labour candidate for Hampstead and Kilburn, told the BBC. Azalea was just eight weeks old at the start of the EU referendum campaign in May 2016, and now Tulip is defending her seat in the general election. ""You stop cleaning your house. You stop buying food and you start keeping odd hours. ""But when you have a baby, the baby can't skip naps. The baby needs food and milk. ""I have to be super-organised, but Azalea knows that things are different now,"" says Tulip. MPs are not legally entitled to maternity leave which puts extra pressure on politicians trying to balance childcare and work. Tulip returned to work when Azalea was three months old and she found breastfeeding and expressing milk particularly challenging. Some people thought her daughter's feeding routine prevented her from committing enough time to the EU referendum campaign, but midwives and doctors advised her to breastfeed. ""I am sure there are people around me who thought I was disruptive or not being helpful because I was breastfeeding,"" she said. On referendum day, she fed her daughter in a cupboard at a polling station to avoid making others feel uncomfortable. Azalea is now weaned so Tulip has been able to be a bit more flexible with her campaign commitments. But like many working mums, she worries about what she may miss. ""The other day she stood up and wobbled her first steps and I was screaming with happiness because I had had a rough day on the doorstep and it was just brilliant to be there and witness that,"" she said.

"Thousands of people were expected to attend the 19th annual event in Birmingham, the last one to benefit from £20,000 council funding. Plans to axe financial support for major public events in the city were confirmed last month. The £20,000 equates to about 30% of the £70,000 running costs. 'Fraction of cost' And the situation is set to get worse in 2017, when the city council is also expected to withdraw logistical support previously offered free and valued at a further £6,000. But festival committee head Anne Tighe said: ""Obviously the council funding was nice but that was a fraction of what it cost. ""We are absolutely not looking at a smaller scale festival."" Birmingham City Council announced plans to stop funding major public events as part of moves to cut £113m from its 2015/16 budget. Pride and Vaisakhi are among the other council funded events affected. Ms Tighe said they were looking at other fundraising streams for St Patrick's Day and planned to apply for additional grants to make up the shortfall. She also said they would seek extra sponsorship and wanted to develop a scheme where businesses pay to be a friend of the festival. ""We also want the Irish community to put their hands in their pocket to support it,"" she said. ""If we want to go on we will need to build up a reserve fund so there's money in the bank if we are struggling."" The event on Sunday, themed the Irish Contribution to Birmingham, is expected to feature 20 floats. Nine bands will take part in the parade and a stage in Bradford Street will house performances from six groups. Father Pat Brown, who traditionally starts the St Patrick's Day celebrations in Birmingham with a mass at Anne's Church in Digbeth, said: ""There is a strong Irish heritage in Birmingham and a strong sense of Irish culture. I don't think that will dwindle. ""The people here are proud of their Irish roots and want to maintain this tradition.""",Organisers of one of the biggest St Patrick's Day parades in the UK have said it will retain its quality despite council funding cuts.
"Part of Clifton Street School in Swindon, which was built in 1884, was torn down last year even though permission had not been granted. Developers G&D Estates, which wants to build 10 flats on the site, said it was an error. Campaigners say it is a valuable part of the town's heritage and want the demolished part restored. Yvonne Neal, who signed the petition, said: ""I used to go to that school. It's part of Swindon's heritage and should be saved."" The school closed in 1987 and was used as offices and then by an electronics company until 2014. Part of the building was torn down last February before work on the project was stopped. G&D Estates said it believed it had permission to do so, but had been mistaken. Retrospective permission was refused by Swindon Borough Council in June. Sally Hawson, from Save Swindon's Heritage, said: ""If we don't start caring soon, then sadly [Victorian buildings] will be all gone and then there will be nothing we can do. ""It adds character to an area, it tells you a lot about the history of our town, and people love it because lots of generations of family have gone to school here."" A new planning application to build flats on the site has been submitted to the council and a consultation period is due to end next week.","A petition to save a Victorian school partially demolished by mistake has attracted almost 1,100 signatures."
"By Stephanie MiskinBBC News, West Midlands Mya and Kia Cross were among thousands who lost their waitress jobs as the hospitality industry was hit hard by coronavirus restrictions. But the 20-year-olds from Erdington said it eventually spurred them on to launch their own separate online businesses. Mya was originally on track for a career in social care, studying at Coventry University, but several months into the course followed her gut feeling that it wasn't for her. She decided to quit - but shortly after, was also made redundant from her part-time job. Mya spotted an opportunity with her newly-acquired free time. Web seminars, a mentor scheme, the creation of a business plan and a loan application followed, after a friend tipped her off about what she could gain from the Prince's Trust. She could finally start her much dreamed-about eyelashes business, Eyes on Eve, and she wasn't alone in her entrepreneurial plans. In 2020, more 16-20-year-olds started a business than any other year, with an increase of 72% on the previous 12 months, according to research by the Partnership Accountancy. It also suggests that 60% of those used social media sites such as Facebook or Instagram to launch their businesses and build a clientele. University 'thrown to young people' ""With business, people think it is too hard and it's not for them. It really isn't,"" said Mya. ""I didn't have a business mindset or know the terminologies. I've learnt as I've gone along. I have just put myself out there."" The 20-year-old said it had been empowering to make big decisions, but that there's a need for more help and support for other like-minded young people. ""I think there are a lot of options for young people like me, but it's just not advertised as much as it should be. The Prince's Trust - I didn't realise what they did until a friend told me. ""University - I feel like it is just something that's run out to young people and it's something that we are expected to do rather than utilizing our skills, going out there and branching out. ""I think there's a lot more options for us, but we're in a system which says 'you need to go and get a degree and study for four years'."" 'I need to chase it and take a risk' Kia admittedly ""had a moment"" of worry when she lost her job, but decided to focus on her love of art instead. The second-year Birmingham Institute of Art and Design student used redundancy money to buy equipment to reproduce and print her artwork on merchandise. ""I didn't see it as me wasting money. I will get it all back eventually,"" she said. ""This is my passion so I need to chase it and take a risk. ""I just thought, I'm going to do it because I've wanted to do it for a while, but this coronavirus kind of pushed me."" She is among 11,000 people to have set up their own business in Birmingham in the past year. 'This is my passion' Kia has launched an online shop and social media pages, KMC Artz, while also creating personalised sportswear over the past year - enough to help her afford to buy her first car. ""This is my passion, the money is like a bonus. I'm never going to be a millionaire overnight."" So what help would Kia like to see for other young business-minded people as local elections loom? ""I'd like to see more opportunities for young people - so we can get more experience. It needs to be practical, so something like mentoring, as not everyone has supportive friends and family. ""We are always going to make mistakes but having someone there to guide you can make a big difference."" How will mayoral hopefuls help young entrepreneurs? Helping young people thrive in business is a key challenge for the West Midlands mayoral candidates as the region attempts to make strides post-pandemic. If elected, what would each one do to support them? Liam Byrne, Labour I started my first business in my 20s. It wasn't easy. It's like a rollercoaster. It's a life of great highs and low lows. You have to juggle cash, time, enthusiasm and creativity. But there was one critical lesson: businesses need customers. I want our region to lead Britain's green and clean future to bring back industry. That will provide our young business people with the local customers they need to succeed. The green industrial revolution will create thousands of jobs and businesses across our region. From supply chains for electric cars to 'green van men and women' in trades fitting renewable energy to homes. Years after selling my business I wrote the book Dragons: Ten Entrepreneurs Who Built Britain. It's an incredible story. The message is clear. Entrepreneurs make history by inventing the future. And today's young people will build tomorrow's West Midlands' green future. Steve Caudwell, Green Party Eight in 10 businesses in the West Midlands are small and medium enterprises so it's essential we support young entrepreneurs as we recover from Covid and seek to defeat the climate crisis. We need to make sure businesses in all sectors are providing apprenticeships, as that's where so many young people get their first taste of work environments, and learning the skills that they can then use in their own endeavours. We also need to look at how we incentivise start-ups through enterprise zones, so that the tax burden on new, young businesses doesn't stop them getting off the ground. We can use the Combined Authority's own purchasing power to prioritise local businesses too. Finally, by addressing the climate, housing and poverty crises we face as soon as possible, we will automatically generate opportunities for new young entrepreneurs to start up and prosper better in the West Midlands. Pete Durnell, Reform UK Lockdowns have hit young people and the poorest in our society the hardest. We must repay the huge sacrifices these groups have made over the last year. This will be one my top priorities. As Metro Mayor, my first step will always be to engage and listen. After I've heard what young entrepreneurs tell me they need, I will get business experts and already successful young entrepreneurs together and work out the best way to deliver it. Facilitating collaboration, providing access to mentors, finance, market intelligence and local support networks, the Metro Mayor can and must get involved with ""all of the above"". I would review existing youth entrepreneurship programmes, assess if any new ones are needed and ensure that resources are always focused on the start-ups with the best chances of succeeding. I believe every sixth-form and college in the region should offer high-quality training in entrepreneurship. Andy Street, Conservative Here in the West Midlands we have a huge number of businesses that are driven by young entrepreneurs, running all kinds of SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises] that contribute enormously to our economic success. Birmingham has been the top city for start-ups outside of London for seven years in a row, with a 27% increase in the year before the pandemic - thanks in part to the schemes I have pioneered as mayor, from digital boot-camps to encouraging the growth of shared co-working spaces for new start-ups. This is a young, vibrant and innovative place which has always been a hotbed for entrepreneurs. My manifesto sets out how I will not only help get our entrepreneurs back on track after the pandemic, but how we will continue to see this highly successful part of our economy grow. Jenny Wilkinson, Liberal Democrats As one of the youngest regions in Europe, it's vital that we invest in young talent - our future engine for innovation, ingenuity and entrepreneurship. There are three key areas I would focus on: • Encourage closer working between schools and businesses to bolster financial and business education, so that our young people have the foundation skills they need to start up in business. • Implement a Universal Basic Income trial to provide young people with a guarantee of financial security and thereby the space to pursue their ambitions, as well as providing targeted grants and access to capital for young people setting up in business. • Set up a mentoring programme to connect current business leaders across the West Midlands with our future business leaders, as well as promoting a young entrepreneurs network, bringing together young people starting out in business, as well as providing a programme of seminars and skills training.

"Commercial TV broadcaster STV decided to close its loss-making second channel after a strategic review. The company said its local TV licences had been sold to a company which runs local stations south of the border. The business - called That's TV - has still not announced its plans for Scotland. Compulsory redundancies STV announced a total of 59 job losses in May - some were the result of the closure of STV2 while others were because of a restructuring of its news operations. Journalists have voted to take strike action if there are compulsory redundancies. However they have put the threat of action on ice amid hope that these can be avoided. Although STV's moves have been condemned by politicians, the company's share price has gone up by a third since the strategic review was announced. An activist investor - Crystal Amber - is continuing to build its stake in the firm and is its biggest shareholder. STV has denied the changes it is making are in preparation for a sale to ITV plc which runs the rest of the Channel 3 network. STV2 has only been on the air for a year but grew out of local services targeted at Glasgow and Edinburgh. Separately, the communications watchdog Ofcom gave its final approval to BBC Scotland's plans for a dedicated TV channel earlier this week. The new channel will start in February. The size of its planned budget is far in excess of the amount which was being spent on STV2 and its editorial remit is different.",STV2 goes off the air for the final time on Saturday night after bosses pulled the plug on the free-to-air television channel.
"The Law Commission says the regulations that govern weddings are ""no longer meeting the needs of many couples"". It has proposed private gardens, beaches, parks and cruise ships as potential suitable venues. Rather than force couples to choose between civil and religious marriages, it believes there should be scope for ceremonies reflecting other beliefs. Professor Nick Hopkins, family law commissioner at the Law Commission, which reviews legislation, said wedding days were one of the most important events in people's lives but current laws were not fit for purpose. ""Our proposals would give couples the freedom to choose the wedding venue they want and a ceremony that is meaningful for them. By doing so, we hope to make the laws that govern weddings reflect the wishes and needs of today's society,"" he said. A spokesman for the Church of England said it would study and respond to the proposals. ""Our research shows that being married in a place that has meaning is still important to couples and their families,"" they said. ""The moments of waiting to walk down the aisle, standing at the steps and exchanging timeless vows that can only be said in a church, and turning to walk out of the church as a newly-married couple, are cherished."" What are the current rules? In England and Wales state a wedding must be either a religious ceremony or a civil ceremony. For religious weddings: For civil ceremonies: Civil ceremonies can include readings, songs or music, but must not include hymns or readings from religious scriptures. The commission says wedding regulations are ""out of kilter"" with the more modern approach to weddings in Scotland, Ireland and the Channel Islands. Scottish weddings are not governed by location restrictions. It means couples have been married in isolated glens, on uninhabited islands and in ancient castles. In addition, the Marriage (Scotland) Act 2002 stipulates marriages be conducted by any ""authorised celebrants"" - not necessarily a minister of religion or a registrar. In Northern Ireland, where same sex religious marriages became lawful on Tuesday, there is no restriction on the location of a religious marriage. However, civil marriages can only take place in approved venues. In England, the Marriage Act 1994 allowed civil marriages to be take place in certain ""approved premises"" other than churches and register offices. This opened up hotels, theme parks and even Oxford Street's Virgin Megastore as official wedding venues. What's proposed? The Law Commission says planning and postponing weddings during the Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the restrictions faced by couples in England and Wales. It wants non-religious belief organisations, such as Humanists, to be able to conduct legally-binding weddings. It also wants to allow weddings to take place remotely during any future national emergency, such as another pandemic. It says such changes would allow for ""simpler, less expensive weddings"". The commission will consult on the proposals until 3 December and aims to publish a report before the end of 2021.",Proposals to allow couples in England and Wales to marry outdoors or inside family homes have been put forward.
"Party leader Gerard Batten wants rules to be changed so the former English Defence League (EDL) activist can join, and has proposed members vote on it. The stance is backed by UKIP assembly leader Gareth Bennett. Mr Batten said North Wales AM Ms Brown was ""ill-informed"" and wrote to members that Robinson would be an ""asset"". South Wales East AM David Rowlands added he did not think Mr Robinson should be allowed to join, saying the former EDL leader joining UKIP may encourage members to leave the party. Ms Brown said she is surprised ""any Welsh politician"" would support Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. Currently the party has a blanket ban on former members of the far-right British National Party and the EDL - meaning the anti-Islam campaigner is barred. The party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), is expected to discuss a proposal on Sunday for a party wide ballot on whether the activist can be specifically allowed in. In an email to members Mr Batten said Mr Robinson would be an ""asset to the party"". Ms Brown is not opposed to the ballot in principle, but said: ""Allowing this former BNP and EDL member to join would be a gift to our opponents, who for once would have some substance behind claims the party is moving to the far-right."" Mr Robinson has criminal convictions for assault, drugs offences and fraud, the AM said. ""Even without his BNP and EDL past, he is not suitable to be a UKIP member,"" Ms Brown added. Mr Rowlands said Mr Robinson's membership could lead others to leave. ""There are a number of members in the party that do not want him to be included,"" he told BBC Wales. Gareth Bennett, who has recently replaced Ms Brown as a voting member of the ruling body, said: ""It's absolutely right that UKIP party members should have their say on this issue, and I for one support Tommy's wish to join the party. He added: ""As Gerard Batten has said, we in UKIP have a unique opportunity to transform into a mass movement truly representing ordinary people."" Mr Batten said Ms Brown was ""entitled to her view, but I think she's entirely mistaken and ill-informed."" Gerard Batten, who was appointed to the role in April and is known for making controversial statements on Islam, has said the party should become ""radical"" and ""populist"". He was recently accused by former assembly leader Caroline Jones of moving the party to the far-right. One party source, who said they could not be in the same party as Mr Robinson, described the potential ballot as a ""referendum on Gerard Batten"". In response to Ms Brown, a spokesman for UKIP Wales said: ""Nobody is proposing that we change the party rules unilaterally; it's simply about whether the members which to give the NEC the ability to make a one-off exception to the rules in this case."" Allegations of contempt of court against Mr Robinson were recently referred to the UK government's most senior legal advisor, the attorney general. Ms Brown was excluded from the assembly without pay for a week earlier in 2018 as punishment for using a racial slur about a Labour MP.","Allowing Tommy Robinson to join UKIP will give substance to claims the party is moving to the far-right, UKIP AM Michelle Brown has said."
"Its teams dealt with 340 incidents and rescued 146 people on Saturday. Saturday was the second day of a mini-heatwave for parts of the UK, with temperatures hitting 34.5C (94.1F). A woman in her 30s died on Sunday after getting into difficulties in the sea off the coast in Waxham, Norfolk. She was recovered from the water but was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital, said Norfolk Police, adding that the death was being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. The latest figures from the coastguard came just over a week after the coastguard reported its previous record of 329 incidents. HM Coastguard's head of coastguard operations, Richard Hackwell, said there had been ""a big rise"" in incidents this weekend ""as more people visit coastal areas and head to the beach"". ""We understand that people want to have fun at the coast and enjoy the heatwave but we urge everyone to respect the sea and take responsibility in helping to ensure the safety of themselves, friends and family,"" he said. Separately, the RNLI called for people to wear life jackets if going out on the sea, after a number of kayakers needed rescuing off the Devon coast on Sunday. The warnings came on another sweltering day for many Britons on Sunday, with a high of 34C recorded in East Sussex, according to BBC Weather. Earlier, it reached 24.3C in Scotland (Achnagart), 23C in Wales (Hawarden) and 21.6C in Northern Ireland (Ballywatticock), BBC Weather said. There will also be little relief from the warm weather overnight, particularly in south-east England, where some face a so-called tropical night - when temperatures stay above 20C. Crowds packed out beaches along the coast for the third day in a row on Sunday as the hot weather continued. Thanet District Council warned four of its beaches in Kent - Margate Main Sands, Viking Bay, Joss Bay and Ramsgate Main Sands - were ""extremely busy"", with high tide likely to make social distancing difficult. And Dorset Council urged people to avoid Lulworth and Durdle Door by midday due to large numbers in the area. Some seafront car parks in Dorset were full by mid-afternoon, and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council warned beachgoers - via a new mobile app - of congestion on much of its 24 beaches. Meanwhile, a woman has died following a collision between a water bike and a boat off Anglesey, in Wales. 'Significant' increase The coastguard co-ordinated search and rescue responses to a wide range of incidents on Saturday, including people being cut off by the tide and children swept out to sea on inflatables. In total, the service responded to 186 emergency 999 calls, rescued 146 people and assisted a further 371. Saturday's incident count represents a ""significant"" 145% increase compared to the average number of call-outs recorded throughout August 2019, the coastguard said in a statement. Mr Hackwell stressed that beachgoers should ""check and double check tide times as even the most experienced swimmer or keen watersports enthusiast can get caught out by currents and tides"". And he encouraged people to plan their days out, ""always exercise caution"" and to make sure they have a way of contacting the coastguard if they get into trouble. The hot weather is likely to continue into next week, with humid nights, according to BBC Weather. Forecasters have predicted ""oppressive"" highs of 34C in the south-east during the day on Monday, with sunny spells expected elsewhere in the UK. However, there is a growing risk of thunderstorms. There is a chance of sharp showers that could turn thundery for some areas in western England and Wales on Monday. Yellow thunderstorm warnings have been issued for all parts of the UK for Monday through to Thursday, with the Met Office stating ""not everywhere will see them, but where they do occur they could be significant and disruptive"". Large parts of England and Wales have been warned there may be torrential rain, large hail, frequent lightning and strong gusty winds. Downpours could see rainfall of 20-30mm in an hour, with some locations potentially receiving 40-60mm in three hours. These would be fairly isolated instances, according to the Met Office. Friday saw the hottest August day in 17 years, with the mercury hitting 36.4C at London's Heathrow Airport and Kew Gardens. Last week, the Met Office warned that climate change driven by industrial society is having an increasing impact on the UK's weather. Its annual UK report confirmed that 2019 was the 12th warmest year in a series from 1884, and described the year as remarkable for high temperature records in the UK.","The UK's coastguard has issued a new warning urging people to be careful in the sea, after recording its highest number of call-outs in a single day for more than four years."
"John Grimshaw, founder of Sustrans, said the city should lose its Cycle City status if current proposals for the Rapid Transit Scheme go ahead. He claimed the plans would split the cycling route ""into bits"" and the connections would not work. Bristol City Council said it accepted that additional provision would be of benefit and plans would be reviewed. 'Boost' Councillor Tim Kent, who is responsible for transport at Bristol City Council, said he had agreed with council officers that some of the cycling provision would be put back in. ""The scheme will bring back in substantial additional cycling provision, including extra bridges and extra cycle ways. It's a real boost for cycling in this city,"" he said. ""But in looking at the plans we do accept that additional provision would be of benefit to cyclists and what we are trying to do at the moment is identify exactly what we can afford to put back in and where we can find that funding."" Mr Grimshaw, who no longer has any role with the charity, said that Bristol had made a permanent commitment to ensure any new transport scheme would improve things for walking and cycling. ""The original proposals, in 2009, for this bus-way did that quite well. ""But they did 'value engineering' and in my language 'value engineering' is removing everything of value for the community. ""The cycling route has been split into bits, the connections don't work and it's too narrow."" Three schemes serving Bristol will make up the Rapid Transport Route project which is expected to cost in the region of £200m. That funding will be split across three authorities along with a government contribution of £112m. The plans are currently under a public consultation and the routes are expected to be operational in 2015.",Cycling provision in Bristol will be reviewed after a transport charity's founder criticised new bus route plans.
"The company had applied for the injunction after the union urged its members not to do overtime. A work to rule began on 20 July, coinciding with major engineering works at Nottingham station. EMT said it was taking the action to protect passengers from what it claimed was unlawful strike action. It urged the RMT to put customers first and have constructive talks to end the dispute. However, the union said the train company should stop wasting money on legal action. EMT is applying to the Court of Appeal following the ruling from the High Court, last week. A spokesman said: ""The RMT has deliberately targeted passengers during a £100m major set of improvement works, which has meant disruption to customers' normal journeys. ""We have worked with our railway partners and other organisations in the region to put a comprehensive plan of alternative services in place."" The company added: ""Instead of supporting that work, the union seems intent on making life as difficult as possible for passengers - causing the direct cancellation of services and delays."" RMT leader Bob Crow said: ""It's a shame that East Midlands Trains have wasted time and money dragging RMT into court under the cloak of the anti-union laws. ""They should have been trying to resolve this dispute which is all about treating RMT members on this franchise with dignity and respect."" He added: ""The industrial relations climate on East Midlands has sunk to a new low with the company attempting to bulldoze through changes off the back of an engineering blockade. ""This has been planned over the long term and is now being dressed up as a bogus emergency to try and justify ignoring procedures and ripping up working agreements."" Work at Nottingham station is taking place until 25 August.",East Midlands Trains (EMT) has said it will appeal against a High Court ruling preventing it blocking industrial action by the RMT union.
"Motorists reported being held in traffic for hours after the blaze erupted on the A14 near Fenstanton, Cambridgeshire. Firefighters posted a photo of the scene showing boxes of underwear which had been removed from the lorry. The road, which was closed in both directions at about 09:30 GMT, finally re-opened at 20:00. Cambridgeshire Fire Service said the fire was out by about 15:00 but the HGV needed to be emptied and moved. The road had been closed between Cambridge and Huntingdon, with one frustrated driver posting on Twitter to say she had been stuck in her car for four hours. Fire service group commander Stuart Smith said: ""I appreciated people are stuck in traffic on both sides of the carriageway and. I'd ask anyone who needs to travel in the area to avoid it and take different routes."" The service said the road would need to be resurfaced once the HGV had been recovered.",A lorry full of bras brought a major road to a standstill when it caught fire.
"By Paul MartinBBC Wales political reporter Ex-MPs Mark Reckless and Neil Hamilton, and Nigel Farage's head of media Alexandra Phillips are all applying to stand as regional list candidates. Ken Beswick, UKIP's general election candidate in Torfaen, said Welsh members should run the party in Wales. UKIP said it wanted the ""best quality of representation possible"" for Wales. If the party maintains recent levels of support in Wales it is likely to get several regional list AMs, as they are elected via a form of proportional representation. The regional list candidates will be picked by a central committee, whereas the party's 40 constituency candidates will be selected by local branch votes. The successful regional list candidates will be announced in October. One former candidate, who did not want to be named, told BBC Wales he was ""extremely angry"" and he and others were considering quitting the party over the way the selection is being run. Another said if Mr Reckless, Mr Hamilton and Ms Phillips were selected they would ""go down like a lead balloon"" with voters. Ken Beswick said: ""They're being brought in from the outside with little knowledge of the area or the people, or the customs, or the assembly for that matter - you need local people. ""UKIP is going to have a hard enough time anyway fighting the Conservatives and Labour and to have candidates coming from the outside that no-one knows, and they're not Welsh, is not going to go down well. ""The autonomy the party should have in Wales isn't there - they're being dictated to by head office."" UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said his party was ""committed to ensuring that the people of Wales have the best quality representation possible"". ""It is for this reason that UKIP has designed a rigorous process for selecting regional list candidates that will ensure that the right people are put forward by the party at next year's elections."" A UKIP spokesman said all major decisions were made by a National Executive Committee to which any UK member could seek election.",Former UKIP election candidates have said allowing high profile figures from outside Wales to apply to stand in the assembly election will put off voters.
"Owner Intu said it plans to spend £114m on changes to almost half of the 55,000 sq m site, which will include more restaurants, cafes and a cinema. The company, which also owns the nearby Victoria Centre, said it would create 2,200 jobs once complete, plus hundreds during construction. No date for when work will start has been announced. Plans to improve the 1970s shopping centre have repeatedly been submitted and approved over the past 15 years but no work has been carried out. The latest proposed changes would see some demolition and rebuilding work with an overall reduction of shopping in favour of food and drink areas and a cinema. Adam Tamsett, centre manager, said: ""We are pleased that Nottingham City Council has awarded planning permission for what is undoubtedly a very important scheme for the city. ""We will review the decision of the planning committee and we look forward to working with the city council to move the project forward."" Plans for the Broadmarsh refurbishment have been criticised for replicating what is already on offer elsewhere in the city. However, councillor Nick McDonald, who is responsible for jobs, growth and transport at the city council, said the centre would bring more people into the city. He said: ""Retail is changing, and the way in which we attract people into cities is changing. ""We think the development is a bonus for the city and we need to get behind it and make sure it happens as quickly as possible.""",A multimillion-pound refurbishment of Nottingham's Broadmarsh shopping centre has been approved.
"Number 10 confirmed the comment by a government lawyer in the High Court represented the ""government's view"". The vote would take place after negotiations have taken place and with Brexit already triggered using Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Campaigners have been calling for a vote before Article 50 is triggered. Open Britain, formerly the Remain campaign, said the government's comments were an ""encouraging sign"" but renewed calls for a debate and vote earlier in the process, before Article 50 begins two years of formal negotiations. The UK is expected to leave the European Union in 2019. Prime Minister Theresa May opposes a vote before Article 50, saying those calling for one are ""trying to subvert"" the outcome of June's referendum. The issue is currently the subject of a landmark legal challenge, with the government defending what it says is its right to invoke Article 50 without Parliamentary approval. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Ben Wright It's the question pre-occupying many MPs as Britain prepares to leave the EU. What role will they have in shaping and approving the final withdrawal deal the UK reaches with Brussels? Theresa May plans to begin talks with the EU by the end of March and negotiations will last for two years. The government's legal team have now clarified what they believe happens then. James Eadie QC said it was ""very likely"" the UK and the EU would agree a new treaty that would have to be ratified by Parliament. A law passed in 2010 gave MPs the power to block a treaty indefinitely. But in practice, would Parliament at that point derail the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU? David Pannick QC, acting for one of the claimants in the High Court case, said even if Parliament refused to approve the final Brexit deal, the UK would have to leave the EU anyway - with or without an agreement. That is why, he argued, parliament needed to vote before formal talks began. Judges who heard the case said they would give their decision ""as quickly as possible"". An appeal to the Supreme Court later in the year is expected, whatever the outcome. During the High Court hearing, government lawyer James Eadie QC moved on to what was likely to happen at the end of the negotiations, in 2019, saying: ""The government view at the moment is it is very likely that any such agreement will be subject to ratification."" If this vote ends with MPs rejecting the Brexit deal, the UK would still leave the EU, Lord Pannick, who is acting for the campaigners challenging the government, told the court. ""Parliament cannot reverse the notification,"" he said. The UK would either leave with no agreement or reach a new one, he said, adding: ""But the new agreement cannot restore the rights that are irretrievably lost, and whether there is a new agreement is out of the hands of Parliament."" Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: ""A vote so late in the day would put MPs between a rock and a hard place. It would ask us to choose between a deal on the government's terms or leaving the European Union with no deal at all."" UK voters opted in favour of leaving the EU by 51.9% to 48.1% in a referendum in June.","Downing Street has said it is ""very likely"" MPs will be able to vote on the final Brexit agreement reached between the UK and the European Union."
"By Ruth CleggBBC News Some 60% of those who rely on social care told a YouGov survey they were finding it hard to obtain at least one of their necessities. Charity WellChild said people felt more ""forgotten than they ever have been"". But ministers say the needs of disabled people were being considered. The Department of Health and Social Care says it has sufficient stocks and patients should contact their local care provider. Like one in 20 of those survey respondents who receive social care, Fi Anderson, a mother of two with muscular dystrophy from Bolton in Greater Manchester, said she has faced problems obtaining breathing apparatus. Her local hospital told her to re-use the filter for her portable ventilator, recommending she boil it, because supplies were so short. UK's disability rights law at 25 She ended up using a dirty filter for six months when it should be changed every day. ""I appreciate the government is in a difficult position and is trying to increase the supply, but it's not happening fast enough. It's putting us at increased risk of hospitalisation,"" she said. ""I'm scared I will end up with pneumonia from using dirty filters too long and the girls will end up without a mum."" Disabled people who rely on social care - which funds equipment and other support to allow them to live independent lives - also said they had struggled to obtain personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks. Many of them receive funding directly to employ carers in their home, so they also need to provide them with PPE during the coronavirus crisis. The survey, which the BBC commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of the Disability Discrimination Act, asked more than 1,000 people about life in the UK with a disability and how it has changed in the shadow of a pandemic. More than 65% felt their rights had regressed, and 71% said disabled people's needs had been overlooked. What questions do you have about the DDA? The Coronavirus Act, which granted the government emergency powers, gave local councils the ability to reduce care, education and mental health provision for disabled people if it became necessary during the pandemic. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, nearly six out of 10 deaths from Covid-19 were of disabled people. 'Lack of contingency planning' Tara Parker, director of programmes at WellChild, criticised the government for failing to recognise the needs of disabled people. She said: ""It's a complete lack of contingency planning and thought about disabled people and their families. ""They've struggled with the right PPE, access to their usual therapies, respite, across the board, there has been a lack of clarity for disabled people what their path should be through this pandemic."" Many of the nurses at Wellchild working with disabled children and young people who use ventilators report that they are experiencing problems with the supply of vital equipment, Ms Parker said. She said this has happened despite reassurances from the government that there would not be problems in the event of a second wave. Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, defended the government's record and said it had sought to create ""good awareness"" of disability issues to ensure ""our support is inclusive"". He said the government is developing a national strategy for disabled people, which is setting challenges for each department to ""remove barriers in society and help create a more inclusive society"".","Some disabled people in the UK have been struggling to obtain essentials such as medication and breathing equipment during the Covid pandemic, research for the BBC suggests."
"By Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor BBC News NI understands Ms Thompson had been prepared to continue in her post, but the first and deputy first ministers have decided against that. As victims commissioner she has had to comment on a number of disputed legacy issues. Those included the delay to the payment of troubles pensions and the definition of a victim. Her period in office was extended for a year by the Northern Ireland Office last year, when there was no power-sharing executive in place. So far it is not clear why Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill have decided not to re-appoint Ms Thompson. Some families of victims of non Troubles-related offences have expressed the view that Northern Ireland should have a commission equivalent to the bodies which operate elsewhere in the UK, which represent all victims of crime. Ms Thompson drew criticism last year over advice she presented to the Northern Ireland Office about a Troubles pension. It gave no distinction between victims of terrorist attacks and those who had been hurt while carrying out attacks. The DUP and Sinn Féin remain at odds over the definition of a victim and progress on paying the pension for victims, or appointing a department to administer it, has stalled. The two parties do agree that the scheme should be funded by Westminster, but NI Secretary Brandon Lewis has insisted the cost - estimated to be at least £100m in its first three years - rests with Stormont. What is the Troubles pension? It was drawn up in 2019 by the UK government, when the Stormont assembly was not functioning. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated another 40,000 people were injured. The scheme aims to provide pension-like payments to victims of the Troubles, every year for the rest of their lives, with payments ranging from £2,000 to £10,000. Victims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010, the date that responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to Stormont. The scheme will be open to those injured anywhere in the UK - no matter where they are from - and to those who normally reside in the UK but were injured anywhere in the world as a result of the Troubles. Paul Gallagher of the WAVE trauma charity said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" at the news. He said: ""I thought she presided over a great forum, a strong forum that provided good, sound advice to politicians."" He said he was worried ""a gap will be left"" for victims and that it could have an impact on victims' pensions. ""We'll continue to fight, but we can't do it alone,"" he said. Mr Gallagher also described the role of victims commissioner as ""a poisoned chalice"". ""It's the most difficult job out there... hampered by arguing over the definition of a victim."" However, Mark Thompson of Relatives for Justice said Ms Thompson's leadership had been ""poor"". He said: ""The commission, under her stewardship, has lost its way and hasn't provided any added value - it hasn't been a proper advocate. ""If anything, it's got in the way of groups across the board progressing matters."" Mr Thompson said the executive ""should have a conversation"" about whether a victims commission is needed.",Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson will not be reappointed when her term finishes at the end of August.
"The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was a ""wake up call"" which supported their call for a targeted badger cull. Welsh Conservatives said ministers had ruled out badger culling ""for political rather than scientific reasons"". The Welsh government said the cattle slaughter figures were disappointing, but had fallen from a peak in 2009. The NFU comments come after Defra - the UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs - released figures showing the increase in cattle slaughtered because of TB in Wales compared to 2011. A total of 9,307 cows were culled in Wales in 2012. The farmers union said the figure meant Wales has seen the figure rise 22%, more a fifth, since 2010, despite farmers ""adhering to strict cattle controls"". NFU Cymru deputy president Stephen James said the figures should be a ""wake up call"" for the Welsh government that tackling the disease with cattle-only measures was not enough. He said: ""These figures show that a policy that fails to adequately tackle and remove the disease from the wildlife population will never get on top and ultimately eradicate this disease from our countryside, instead the disease continues to escalate. ""This has to a wakeup call to Welsh government and highlights the urgent need to implement a science-led policy of badger control in endemic areas of the country rather than the Welsh government's vaccination policy based on conjecture."" The Welsh Conservatives' rural affairs spokesman Antoinette Sandbach AM said the Welsh government trial vaccination programme ""remains a costly gamble"". 'Wildlife infection' She said: ""Culling is the only proven method to tackle the reservoir of wildlife infection, yet badger culling has been ruled out by Labour ministers for political rather than scientific reasons. ""In Wales, the increase in the number of cattle culled due to TB is 15% - more than double the increase in England. ""This significant increase in cattle culling only reinforces the need for the Welsh government to get to grips with TB."" The NFU said more than 48,000 cattle have been culled in Wales in the past five years, with only 1,046 being culled in 1998. The Welsh government said it remained committed to tackling bovine TB. ‪""These figures are disappointing but do still reflect a significant reduction against the 2008/2009 peak in the number of cattle slaughtered in Wales as a result of bovine TB,"" said a spokesperson. ""We remain committed to tackling bovine TB given its impact on farmers and rural communities. ""However we know there is no quick fix to tackling this disease. ""It demands a sustainable and long term approach that includes a range of different measures including strict bio security controls and cattle movement restrictions."" The spokesperson said the Welsh government was continuing with its ""comprehensive"" bovine TB eradication programme, which tackled all sources of infection.","A farming union claims a 15% rise in the number of cows in Wales slaughtered due to bovine TB shows the disease is ""out of control"" in the countryside."

"His aide Norman Lamb threatened to quit over the ""very risky"" pace of change. But Mr Clegg said Mr Lamb agreed with him and did not want to ""reopen the Pandora's Box"" of the basic plan to give GPs more financial powers. The plans would give GPs in England control of 60% of the NHS budget and let more private firms provide care. But although the legislation has completed much of its passage through the Commons, the government has agreed to a two-month ""pause"" to listen to concerns - including from NHS staff - following widespread criticism of the plans - including from the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing. Liberal Democrat party members overwhelmingly rejected what they called the ""damaging and unjustified"" shake-up of GP services, including more scrutiny of GP consortia in a vote at their spring conference. A petition designed to put pressure on Lib Dem MPs to make good on the motion has attracted the signatures of 1,200 Lib Dem members. 'Devil in detail' On Sunday Mr Lamb - one of Mr Clegg's closest advisers who spoke for the party on health issues when it was in opposition - told the BBC that plans to give GPs control of budgets should not be ""rushed into"". He added that primary care trusts - due to be axed under current plans - ""have to stay"" for a transitional period and that he would step down as Mr Clegg's parliamentary private secretary if some changes were not made. Asked if the question of whether primary care trusts could remain was up for argument, he said: ""There's no point having a pause unless you are prepared to make substantive changes at the end of it, where those substantive changes are necessary."" He said the ""status quo needs to change"": ""Everybody agrees it is right to put more financial responsibility into the hands of GPs who know the patients best, but how you do that is - the devil lies in the detail there. ""Yes it is unusual that a government is saying look, we're going to have a pause and listen and reflect and change things where necessary, but I think it's a good thing we are listening."" He said the government was prepared to make changes if needed on issues like how GPs should be made more financially responsible ""how are the consortia composed, at what period of time"". ""We're not going to allow GP consortia who are not ready to take on these commissioning functions. If they are not ready by the April 2013 deadline"" But he added: ""We are not saying, Norman is not saying, the Liberal Democrats were not saying at our Sheffield conference, that we are going to reopen the Pandora's Box of the basic design of a new system where you are giving GPs more financial responsibility, where you are stripping out layers of bureaucracy and you are giving local authorities, accountable to local people, much greater say in the way that the whole health system works. ""Those basic building blocks are still in place, but the details of how you make those principles work in practice are of course things we want to get right."" Speaking at the Royal College of Nursing's annual conference, general secretary Peter Carter said the reforms as they were designed at the moment were a real risk to the NHS. He said he supported the basic principles of giving patients more power and involving NHS staff more in decision-making. But he added: ""Despite the honourable principles behind the bill, it could well turn out to be the biggest disaster in the history of our public services. ""The sheer size of the changes must not be underestimated. Even during the good times, when the sun was shining and the money was flowing, these reforms would have been huge. Now that the clouds of economic gloom hang over us and the cupboard is empty reforming the NHS like this begins to look very difficult indeed.""","Deputy PM Nick Clegg says the ""basic building blocks"" of controversial NHS plans will remain, but changes could be made on how they work ""in practice""."
"By Hamish MackayBBC News According to figures from the British Transport Police, 2018 has seen a 20% rise in members of the public intervening to stop people killing themselves on railways. In May, while out walking her dog, Gillian became one of those people. ""At first I didn't know what it was,"" she tells the BBC, recounting her journey back home past the bridge. ""But as we got closer, I realised it was a person. ""They were crying, hysterically crying and making noises."" 'I had to have a plan' At that moment, Gillian decided to investigate, but it would not be until months later that she would realise the true impact of her actions. ""I knew I had to have a plan,"" says Gillian. She feared the man might be aggressive, either verbally or physically, but says she knew that, no matter what, she ""wasn't going to walk past him"". Slowly, with her dog, she approached and called out to ask if the man ""was OK"". ""No I'm not,"" he shouted back. ""I could see that he was in a really bad state,"" says Gillian. ""He was angry but he was crying as well."" She says she decided ""she was going to be brave"" and approach him. Gillian persuaded him to sit down with her on the Tarmac in the middle of the bridge with ""him on one side, me on the other and the dog in between us"". From experience of her daughter's anxiety, Gillian knew of the importance of ""grounding"", so began to ask basic questions such as his name and where he was from to ""break his emotion"". His name was Tommy. He was 23 years old. After ""10 or 15 minutes"", Tommy began to calm down but was ""still monosyllabic"". At that point, a train passed below them. It made Gillian wonder whether he ""would have gone"" if she had not been there. Information and advice If you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support through BBC Action Line . Tommy told Gillian why he was on the bridge, but that, she says, is a matter that will remain between them. Eventually, she persuaded Tommy to call his parents and let them know where he was. She waited until they arrived - about 25 minutes after she first approached Tommy - then retreated. ""I was a bit blown away, thinking: 'Did that just happen?'"" Gillian only spoke to her mother and a friend about her experience - but later in the year realised people she had never met were discussing her story online. One Sunday morning, her husband showed her a Facebook post. It began: ""I know I'm asking the impossible, and I know this is like looking for a needle in a haystack, but four months ago I tried to take my life and and a stranger stopped me with her dog..."" As she read the post, Gillian realised she was the stranger. She decided not to reply on the thread - ""I thought, it's not about me and it shouldn't be about me. It was about him."" Her husband sent Tommy a private message, explaining the stranger was his wife. The pair spoke on the phone that day. Three days later they arranged to meet in a local pub. ""I saw him walking from the other side of the pub, he flung his arms around me and I thought: 'Bless him.'"" He clung to her for more than a minute, saying: ""You saved my life. You saved my life."" 'Overwhelming' They spent an hour together, which Gillian describes as ""special"". ""Since then we've walked the dog a few times and we're in contact two or three times a week,"" she says. ""It is the most overwhelming feeling I've ever had, other than giving birth. ""He's in my heart now. The bond is there and it is unbelievable. ""It's a very unusual bond - it's not spiritual, it's just an invisible and not tangible thing in my heart."" Tommy is still waiting for counselling on the NHS, Gillian says, but the pair have planned a trip back to the bridge where they met ""to make a nice, new experience"". Gillian Assor is supporting Samaritans' Small Talk Saves Lives campaign.","""I'm not a hero,"" says Gillian Assor, six months after preventing a suicide on a railway bridge near London. ""I just happened to be walking past."""
"Aya Hachem, 19, died when shots were fired from a passing car on 17 May. Five people have appeared in court charged with her murder while officers have been granted more time to question another murder suspect. Police have also appealed for dashcam footage from anyone traveling along the A666 between Bolton and Blackburn between 14:00 and 16:00 BST. ""I appreciate this is quite a long period of time but knowing who was moving along that road at those times is key to us,"" said Det Supt Andy Cribbin, from Lancashire Police. Ms Hachem was walking along King Street to the supermarket when she was hit by one of two bullets fired from a car. Ms Hachem's parents paid tribute to her as the ""most loyal devoted daughter"" who ""dreamed of becoming a solicitor"". The Lebanese-born teenager, who was a second-year student at the University of Salford, was buried in the town of Koleileh on Saturday. Her mother Samar Hachem, who had travelled to Lebanon for the funeral, recalled the moment she was informed of her daughter's death.

"By Debbie JacksonBBC Scotland The death of maths teacher Gerry McHugh, 58, on Saturday, shocked the school community at Greenock's Notre Dame High. Due to lockdown restrictions, pupils were unable to leave flowers or attend a funeral. Instead they wore red and posted images in memory of the lifelong Manchester United fan. When his death was announced on Saturday, many pupils expressed their sadness online that they would not be able to pay respects at his funeral because of lockdown restrictions. They soon came up with a way to remember the much-loved teacher while observing social distancing - creating the social media hashtag #redforgerry. Mr McHugh regularly attended Man United games at Old Trafford and his classroom was decorated with memorabilia. Those who wanted to show their appreciation were urged to wear red and post a picture using the tag. The hashtag was launched on Sunday and hundreds of pupils and friends posted tributes to the inspirational teacher described as ""a lovely man inside and out"". The hashtag ended up trending on Twitter. One of those who posted was Greenock boxer Rhys McCole. A former pupil, he said: ""Mr McHugh was a great man and teacher who encouraged and included everyone, he was always checking on me and wanting me to achieve the best I could. ""I will continue to follow his wise words."" As well as posting a photograph of him with the teacher, he posted a picture of himself wearing a red boxing outfit and gloves as part of the tribute. Others wore red T-shirts and recounted their memories of the teacher, while Inverclyde Council turned its usually blue logo to red in remembrance. Another former pupil, Karen Hunter praised Mr McHugh for inspiring her to study maths and become a teacher herself. She told the BBC: "" I was a pupil of Gerry's for Higher maths, I then went on to study maths and then secondary teaching. ""I did a placement in Notre Dame with Gerry as principal teacher and then worked with him for more than a year before moving to my current school where I have been for 21 years where I am now depute. ""He was an incredible man who inspired a number of students to go into teaching - if we can be as half as good as he was then we are doing well."" 'A true gentleman' Notre Dame head teacher Kate Couttie announced the news of Mr McHugh's death on Saturday. She said: ""It is with the greatest of sadness that I have to report that Mr Gerry McHugh passed away this afternoon. His family cared for him deeply and are very proud of him and what he achieved. ""This loss will have a devastating effect on our entire school community, our mathematics department who loved him dearly, the wider staff who found him a rich source of experience and knowledge as well as our pupils and parents (past and present) all of whom respected him so highly."" She added: ""Every teacher hopes that they can make a connection with young people - Gerry had a unique gift in being able to inspire every single pupil who walked through his classroom door. ""Pupils at Notre Dame High School loved learning mathematics because of him. Gerry had a kind word for everyone he spoke to, he was also funny, committed and caring in everything he did for our school - a true gentleman.""",School pupils in Inverclyde have found a safe way to honour a teacher who died with coronavirus during the lockdown.
