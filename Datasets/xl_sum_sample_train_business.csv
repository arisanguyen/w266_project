"Centrica made a loss of £849m in the year ended 31 December compared with a £987m profit the year before. That sent the share price tumbling by 15% in early trading on Thursday. Chief executive Iain Conn said: ""It's true that 2019 was going to be a difficult year, with the first year of the implementation of the price cap, and it did hit us by £300m"". ""But we also had the falling price of gas, which affected our North Sea businesses, which we're selling,"" Mr Conn told the BBC Today programme. However, he added that its customer divisions ""did well"" in terms of underlying profits. The price cap on electricity and gas bills came into effect in January 2019 and was a flagship policy of former Prime Minister Theresa May to end what she called ""rip-off"" prices. Last week, energy regulator Ofgem told suppliers to cut average standard bills and pre-pay bills by 1.4% from 1 April as wholesale prices had fallen between August 2019 and January 2020. Centrica, which has a 20% stake in Britain's nuclear power stations, added that outages at two nuclear plants last year had also hit earnings. Centrica woes Julie Palmer, partner at consultants Begbies Traynor said: ""These latest results suggest Centrica is running out of gas, with the government's price cap on energy bills, strong competition from start-ups and the search for a new chief executive hampering the firm's performance. ""The energy supplier has had to cut tariffs for millions of its customers, leading to thousands of job losses as the company aims to reduce costs and improve its profitability."" She said that investors will want to know the long-term strategy as the UK aims for net zero carbon emissions by 2050. ""With Centrica's stakes in numerous fossil fuel businesses, it will need to reshape its portfolio to get itself back on its feet,"" Ms Palmer added. Customers have been dropping away from the six biggest suppliers on the UK energy market, and experts hailed 2019 as the year that the group's stranglehold on the market was finally broken for good. Centrica's rival SSE was bought by one of the smaller challengers, Ovo Energy, which only entered the market a decade ago. Ovo and other challengers spent the second half of the last decade stealing customers away from the bigger rivals, cutting Centrica's market share from 24% when Mr Conn took over, to 19% towards the end of last year, according to figures from Ofgem. ""British Gas is really struggling with the onslaught from small suppliers, the price cap, and falling natural gas prices hitting them hard,"" said Mark Todd, co-founder of Energyhelpline.",British Gas owner Centrica has blamed a big loss in 2019 on the energy price cap and falling gas prices.
"By Shahzeb JillaniBBC News The good news is that its economy is not about to collapse. The bad news is that, without basic reforms, it is likely to be stuck in a slow and steady decline Last week, Pakistan's economic managers sought to play down worries that the country may be at risk of failing to make debt repayments to the International Monetary Fund. ""We have adequate foreign exchange reserves,"" declared the governor of the Pakistan's central bank, Yaseen Anwar. ""Any decline in reserves will be off-set by expected rise in remittances and foreign investment,"" he said. The assurance was part of a damage-control exercise. Last week, in an interview published in the Wall Street Journal, the governor was quoted as saying that Pakistan's failure to control its budget deficit could force it to return to the IMF for assistance. Given the perpetually vulnerable state of Pakistan's economy, that is a possibility most analysts do not rule out. But it is quite another matter for a bank governor to openly warn of such a risk. As expected, his reported comments caused panic in Pakistan's fragile foreign exchange market. Over the next two days, an already weakening Pakistani rupee plunged to a record low. It came as Pakistan's finance minister, Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, conceded that the economy had missed its target growth rate of 4.2%, and would expand instead by about 3.7% in the current fiscal year ending 30 June. Figures released last week confirmed that investment was at its lowest in decades, fuelling joblessness and pushing more people into poverty. All this, at a time when the country is reeling from 11 years of militancy from al al Qaeda and the Taliban, worsening power black-outs and double-digit inflation. In May, Pakistan's inflation rate reached a 10-month high of 12.29%. Populist budget? Analysts say the root-cause of Pakistan's economic ills is a ballooning fiscal deficit, projected to be around 7% of GDP this year. The government says it aims to reduce the deficit to 4.7%, although many analysts are unclear how the government intends to go about achieving this. Last week, the government became the first elected administration to survive long enough present its fifth consecutive budget. Officials described it as an historic day for democracy in Pakistan. But that did not stop critics from decrying the budget as populist and devoid of necessary structural reforms. It was, they argued, designed to help woo voters ahead of elections expected in six-to-nine months. Taxes were cut, salaries of public sector employees raised, and additional funds allocated for the construction of roads, schools and hospitals. ""The government will be in a hurry to spend much of that money before the polls,"" says Dr Hafeez Pasha, a leading economist and a former finance minister. ""One can't say whether these funds will be managed properly and fairly,"" he said. The government also announced the creation of 100,000 new jobs in the public sector. At a time when many of Pakistan's Public Sector Enterprises - such as Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Railways - are already struggling for survival due to over-staffing, mismanagement, and political meddling, it's not clear how the government plans to absorb this additional workforce. ""It's the same old approach: political governments trying to take on the role of an employment agency,"" says Prof Ashfaq Hasan Khan, dean of the National University of Sciences & Technology, in Islamabad. ""Instead, what they should be doing is to frame policies to help create new jobs,"" he said. Structural reform Most analysts agree that the lack of structural reform and poor governance, and an apparent policy paralysis, has hampered the country's economic potential. Pakistan is sometimes referred to as the 'sick man' of South Asia. ""Unless Pakistan changes course and corrects its structural imbalances, we will have to go back to the IMF,"" says Dr Pasha. And the sooner the better, he believes. ""That way, we'll able to avoid a full blown crisis."" After all, as experts point out, Pakistan's track record in implementing IMF conditions is not particularly good. The last time the IMF bailed out Pakistan, with $11.3bn (£7.3bn), was in 2008. That programme ended when Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's government rejected demands for reform and walked out of the arrangement prematurely. ""This time, the conditions are likely to be even tougher and harsher,"" says Dr Pasha. ""For that reason, I don't see the present government negotiating with the Fund and implementing its conditions before to the elections. ""They appear to be on course to leave a big economic mess behind which the next government will to grapple with,"" he said.",Pakistan is a nuclear weapon state with a population of 200 million. Its economic health is of huge significance.
"The plan, covering stores including Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Wallis, was approved by Arcadia's creditors. After a week's delay and five hours of discussion Arcadia's landlords finally agreed to rent cuts, 23 store closures and 520 job losses. Once the plan is in place another 25 stores and 500 jobs will be axed. Ian Grabiner, CEO of Arcadia Group, said he was ""confident about the future of Arcadia"". ""From today, with the right structure in place to reduce our cost base and create a stable financial platform for the Group, we can execute our business turnaround plan to drive growth."" What just happened? Arcadia's landlords were voting on the company's rescue plan, known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA). This is an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. In the case of Arcadia it will involve store closures and reduced rents across 194 of its 566 UK and Irish stores over a three-year period. Last week, Arcadia secured the backing of pensions trustees, the Pension Protection Fund and most of its suppliers, for its plan. However, it came up against stiff resistance from one of its biggest creditors, the shopping centre operator Intu, which called the deal ""unfair"" and voted against it. Intu owns and manages some of the UK's biggest retail properties. A spokesperson for the group said: ""We firmly believe that the terms of the Arcadia CVA are unfair to our full rent paying tenants and not in the interests of any of our other stakeholders, including Intu shareholders and the 130,000 people whose jobs rely on the success of our prime shopping centres."" Lady Tina Green, Sir Philip Green's wife and Arcadia's majority shareholder, has also committed to pay £25m annually into the pension funds over three years, plus an additional £25m. Rt Hon Frank Field MP, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""Now that, thankfully, Arcadia's life has been extended, the Committee will try to ensure that the Pensions Regulator gets an effective programme in place to ensure that Arcadia staff receive in full the pensions that Sir Philip and Lady Green have promised them."" Why was the vote so important? If the CVA had not been passed Arcadia had said it would have been forced to go into administration. Troubles at the group came to a head when it announced that sales in its stores open for more than a year fell 9% in 2018-19. Profits this year are expected to be £30m, compared with £219m two years ago. Faced with fixed charges of £100m a year, the group said it was struggling to pay its way - so it decided on a CVA. A CVA is a renegotiation of terms with a company's creditors as part of an insolvency procedure. Arcadia had argued that it was ""over-rented"", paying too much for the space it occupied and the CVA initially called for cuts of 30% to 70%. However, after stiff resistance from the landlords it softened its demand to rent cuts of between 25% and 50%. What went wrong with Arcadia? Retail analysts say Arcadia's misfortunes are due less to rentals than to its failure to compete. They say it has been losing out to contemporary ""fast-fashion"" retailers, ranging from High Street chains, such as Zara and H&M, to pure online players such as Asos. Chloe Collins, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Most of its brands such as Dorothy Perkins and Miss Selfridge have lost relevance in today's retail landscape due to their uninspiring fashion ranges and weak multichannel offer. ""Even Topshop, which used to be Arcadia's star player, has lost appeal."" While many believe Arcadia needed more investment the Green family stands accused of taking billions out of the group at the point when it need it most. In 2005 a £1.2bn dividend, the largest corporate payout in UK history, was paid by Arcadia's parent company, Taveta, to the Green family. Will the CVA save Arcadia? Lady Green has agreed to invest £50m of equity into the group, in addition to the £50m of funding already provided in March. However some analysts believe it may be too little too late. The investment would be ""too thinly spread"", GlobalData's Chloe Collins said. ""The agreed closures still leave Arcadia with an estate of around 500 stores which have been neglected for far too long and are now unable to match competition which moves in favour of experience-led shopping,"" she added. Ed Cooke, chief executive of retail property organisation Revo, said: ""It is clear that a CVA alone will not be enough to save the jobs of 18,000 hardworking Arcadia employees, and we hope the restructuring plans for the brands will be enough to ensure they have a sustainable future."" The restructuring has to be done quickly. Catherine Shuttleworth chief executive and founder of Savvy Marketing warned ""the clock is ticking - if they don't act fast they will be back with another CVA"". She said: ""They have to invest heavily in online. Shoppers at Topshop and Topman are more and more dissatisfied - they have to create a more seamless online shopping experience. ""They may also have to speed up the store closure programme, to have fewer but better stores, and they may sell off brands. They have been saying they already have some buyers interested."" As for Sir Philip's involvement Ms Shuttleworth said: ""So long as he produces the money, that's all that matters. Otherwise he should just let his management get on with it and stay away.""",Sir Philip Green's Arcadia retail empire has been saved by a rescue deal that will trigger the closure of 48 stores and a thousand jobs.
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter But he had to stump up £1,000 for flights home on Thursday, which is three times as expensive as the return flights he had already paid for. ""I never thought they would re-impose quarantine after giving Portugal the all-clear,"" John told the BBC. ""The airlines have us over a barrel and don't seem to have any sympathy."" He's one of the many holidaymakers scrambling to get out of Portugal amid reports it is about to be taken off the government's safe travel list. Many have been hit with surging flight prices, but feel they have no choice but to pay as they cannot afford to isolate for 14 days on their return. John said: ""We'd been waiting six months to visit our villa in the Algarve, and as soon as the government said it was OK to travel, we booked our flights."" The single dad from Bristol paid £320 for return flights from Bristol for himself and 12-year-old daughter Georgie, arriving last week. Once he heard rumours of the new travel restrictions he felt he had no choice but to spend £1,000 to get home before the potential deadline. He said: ""My daughter was in tears yesterday at the thought of not being able to go back to school and see her friends. ""She has already missed most of year seven [at school] and I can't let her miss the first two weeks of year eight."" Despite having booked on flights returning to Bristol for this coming Saturday, he said he didn't want to risk being forced to self-isolate. But there were no earlier flights available to Bristol, so he had to buy Easyjet flights to Gatwick at just over £1,000. Easyjet denied that it was taking advantage of worried holidaymakers. ""As with all airlines, our pricing is demand-led, which means that as more seats are booked on a flight the price will rise, so our fares start low and increase the closer it is to the date of departure,"" the airline told the BBC. ""The fare highlighted is the direct result of high demand for flights. We do not artificially increase ticket prices."" 'Mad stampede' Many other holidaymakers have contacted the BBC with similar stories. Jodie Hudson-Cox, from Essex, was originally going to fly back to Southend from the Algarve on Saturday, but has also changed her plans. ""I re-booked early this week for flights coming back into East Midlands airport on Friday. We booked the flights so we weren't sat here worrying about it all week,"" she told the BBC. Londoner Wayne Scott is due to fly to Portugal for work in two weeks. ""I´m a street entertainer and the summers are prime time for getting work and travelling to different countries and festivals around the world to make my living, so this rare chance of work is very important,"" he said. But he is already currently in quarantine after returning from working in Spain. ""I can´t risk another two weeks of quarantine,"" he told the BBC. ""The government must give us more warning so that we can make other plans."" Meanwhile, Neil Millington, of south London, is currently on the Portuguese island of Madeira, which is more than 1,000km away from the Portuguese mainland. He reckons it would be ridiculous for the island to face travel restrictions. ""Madeira has only had 157 cases altogether and they have a fantastic system here for Covid-testing,"" he said. ""There are an awful lot of English people here and there will be a mad stampede to get a flight back if restrictions are announced.""",John Cushing is cutting his Portugal holiday short to make sure his daughter gets home to the UK before being hit by expected new quarantine restrictions.
"By Peter Whittlesea & John OwenVictoria Derbyshire programme Nicola McKenzie is one of hundreds of people complaining they have been incorrectly punished by the US firm Concentrix, used by the government to cut tax credit fraud and overpayment. She is struggling to feed her son, she told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. The government said Concentrix would ""not be paid"" for wrong decisions. The Treasury has revealed 120 cases since last October where the company did not ""fully"" meet the performance standards laid out in its contract. But it is feared the actual number may be higher. The Facebook campaign group Concentrix Mums, which has 5,600 members, says hundreds more people have been affected by errors. 'Make contact' Labour MP Louise Haigh is demanding that Concentrix be stripped of its contract, saying: ""They've stopped people's benefits on a quite incredible scale in order to chase profits."" Ms McKenzie, a 19-year-old single mother from West Yorkshire, received a letter from the company saying her child tax credits would be cancelled. ""Basically they were accusing me of being married to a 74-year-old bloke that used to live here way before I did, saying that it's a normal thing for my kind of age,"" she said. ""When I spoke to the council, they said he was deceased and died on 5 July 2016,"" Ms McKenzie added. ""Then they said 'Well, you still need to get him to make contact with us'. And I said 'Well, heaven doesn't have opening hours, so what do you want me to do about that?'."" Ms McKenzie said she had lost £64 a week, which meant she was finding it difficult to provide nappies and food for her two-year-old son. In May last year, Concentrix won a £75m contract to try to save the government more than £1bn in incorrect or fraudulent tax credit payments. Tax credits - the Child Tax Credit and the Working Tax Credit - are government payments made to households on low incomes. Concentrix's government contract is based on a payment-by-results model, with the ""maximisation of revenue flows"" as one of its key requirements - meaning it makes more money if it cuts more payments. 'Very personal' Sharon Scargill, a mother from West Yorkshire, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme her tax credits had been cut after she received a letter from the company saying she was living with another woman of whom she had never heard. ""I've got £20 to last me two weeks, as of yesterday, to feed me and my daughter and for the bills that I'm supposed to pay and the gas and electric,"" she said. Ms Haigh, MP for Sheffield Heeley, said some people receiving the letters were confusing them with a phishing scam, as they asked for ""very personal details"", such as bank statements and information on partners' details. The problems with Concentrix were on a ""grand scale"", she added. But an HM Revenue and Customs spokesperson said support was ""available for those who need it"", adding: ""We take great care to make sure that correct tax credit payments are made to prevent customers getting into debt, which they may struggle to repay. ""Payments to Concentrix are based on the quality and accuracy of their work. They will not be paid if the decisions they make about claimants' awards are wrong."" A Concentrix spokesman said: ""We recognise that the re-evaluation of individual tax credits claims can be difficult for all concerned. ""We adopt a rigorous process at every stage to ensure we manage this process responsibly, and in full accordance with the protocols and guidance set by HMRC."" The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","A teenage mother had her child tax credits stopped after she was wrongly accused of being married to a dead 74-year-old man, the BBC has learned."
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent And next week, the state of today's education standards across the developed world will be revealed with the publication of the results of the OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment, better known as the ""Pisa tests"". This mammoth, three-yearly exercise, will produce international education rankings for more than 60 countries and dozens of regional administrations, based on tests in reading, maths and science taken by more than 500,000 15-year-olds. And in the future it could get even bigger, with Mr Schleicher saying he wants to develop OECD rankings for universities. Global league table This latest world cup of school standards will reveal whether the Asian school systems, such as in Shanghai in China, Singapore and South Korea, remain world-beaters. And will the old Western powers, such as the US, the UK and France, remain stuck in the ""must do better"" category of this global classroom? But what's the point of this vast piece of number crunching? Mr Schleicher, now courted and quoted by education ministers, says the idea began in the 1990s with the simple recognition that governments were being compared on how much cash they were spending on education, rather than levels of achievement. It was all about what was going in and nothing about what was coming out. So the idea was launched for pupils in different countries to take pen and paper tests in core subjects and see how they compared. And the name Pisa was chosen, not for any link to the Italian city, but because it was an acronym that was spelt the same in English and French. Pisa topping Mr Schleicher says that in a globalised world the key comparisons are with other countries - and this is true for education as much as economics. ""Your country's competitiveness and your individual job prospects are heavily influenced by what happens in other countries,"" he says. ""In a global economy improvement by national standards is not a measure of success. You compete globally."" Only relying on national exams, where the grades seem to keep improving, is a dishonest disservice to young people, he argues. ""It's like telling a disadvantaged student in your classroom, 'It doesn't matter how you compare with people in other schools, I'll give you a good mark because you're doing the best you can.' ""That's very nice, but once the student gets out into the labour market they're going to feel the brunt of reality."" ""It is very important to know how well our students are prepared for a global economy."" Bringing bad news This hasn't always made Pisa many friends. It can puncture the idea that everything is getting better. The first victim of ""Pisa shock"" was Mr Schleicher's own country, Germany, a country that had nurtured a self-image of a high-performing education system. But the Pisa results from 2000 suggested that it was only mediocre, causing a storm of controversy and national soul-searching. A German newspaper described the experience as an ""instructive disaster"". Among the starkest revelations has been the decline of the US school system. This former education superpower has been caught up and left behind by many other countries, particularly in Asia. This was distasteful medicine and Mr Schleicher says that the US administration was deeply unhappy with the 2006 results and was trying to apply pressure on the OECD. The US politician who intervened to defend the importance of publishing the results was Ted Kennedy, says Mr Schleicher. Kennedy, who had chaired the senate committee on education, had become very supportive of the Pisa project. ""It was Senator Kennedy who saved my life at the OECD,"" he says. In Italy, the 2009 results revealed another hidden weakness. While top grades in national exams were spread evenly across the country, the Pisa tests showed that pupils in the north were performing at a much higher level. This meant that it was much easier to get a high grade in the south of Italy - and since public jobs depended on such grades, it represented an ""incredible unfairness"". Without the external measurement of Pisa such problems would remain invisible. There are other critics who warn against the impact of the narrow focus of Pisa - which ranks school systems on a very limited number of measures. The influential UK head teacher, Anthony Seldon, warned of governments becoming ""increasingly mesmerised and bedazzled"" by the Pisa tests. ""Such tests are deeply flawed and their impact is profoundly damaging to young people,"" he says. Rise of Asia The tests have also revealed the changing face of the education world. Pisa has recorded the rise and rise of countries and cities in Asia, such as South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, where investment in education has been used as a way of fast-forwarding their economies. Looking to England, Mr Schleicher says he welcomes the readiness of Education Secretary Michael Gove to ""open all the cupboards and see what's inside, see what the problems are"". ""That's an essential starting point. You can debate about some of the medicine, but at least there's a serious search for the issues and challenges."" He says schools in England should move away from an ""industrial mindset"" and teachers should be given a ""high degree of professional autonomy"". But Mr Schleicher remains unconvinced by changes to the national curriculum. So how can international comparisons in education standards ever be really fair? Is it meaningful to compare countries as different as Finland, Peru and Vietnam? Mr Schleicher is a robust defender of such comparisons, saying whether or not they are fair, young people from all those countries are competing with one another in a globalised economy. The skills they learn are going to be hugely important to their life chances. ""It's not about the elite, it's the poor who are affected by globalisation, they are the ones who are going to lose their jobs because they're not keeping up with the skills on the other side of the world."" In terms of the methodology, the test results are based on a representative sample of around 5,000 pupils in each school system, overseen by the OECD. Some have bigger numbers, with more than 12,000 in the UK and 38,000 in Italy. The tests are designed by Australian researchers with the requirement that questions are culturally neutral, as relevant in Tunisia as Estonia. The forthcoming results will also provide a much more detailed picture of regional differences. It will show how US states such as Massachusetts or regions within Spain and Italy would have scored if they were ranked as countries. But this isn't just one giant data fest. There is a human purpose to all this, says Mr Schleicher. These tests show the gaps in some basic skills needed by young people. And once these youngsters have left school without these skills, he says, it is ""very hard to fix retrospectively"". ""In the US the whole pipeline is broken and in Europe there are 80 million who can't read better than a 10-year-old child. ""What are you going to do with these people. That's the real challenge. ""The countries with good school systems have great assets.""","""Your education today is your economy tomorrow,"" says Andreas Schleicher from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, who has become one of the world's most influential figures in education."
"Gala Bingo operates 130 bingo clubs with 1.1 million members and claims 38% of the UK retail bingo market. The move is the latest in a series of ownership changes in the betting sector this year. Gala Coral, Gala Bingo's parent company, is itself in the process of being bought by rival betting business Ladbrokes. Gala said the sale of the clubs would help to pave the way for the deal, which is subject to approval by regulators. Other tie-ups in the sector this year include Betfair and Paddy Power, and online firm 888 with rival Bwin. Gala Coral will keep ownership of the online bingo website, galabingo.com.

"The probe relates to 2008 when Barclays was raising money from Middle East investors during the banking crisis. The Financial Services Authority had said in July it was looking at issues around Barclays' deal with the Qataris. Separately, in June Barclays was fined £290m for rigging Libor interest rates. Investors will be closely watching Barclays share price when the London stock market reopens for trade on Thursday morning. Its shares had closed down by 1.38% at 186.35 pence on Wednesday. Semi-nationalised The SFO confirmed that the Barclays statement was correct but declined to release further details of the investigation. Barclays also refused to comment. But it is understood that after the FSA investigation was begun in July, information was made available to the SFO prompting it open a formal investigation. Barclays has not revealed which payments between it and Qatar are being investigated by the SFO. The bank raised some £2bn from Qatar Holding in 2008. Funds raised from investors in Qatar and Abu Dhabi that year allowed Barclays to avoid being semi-nationalised along with Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds. In July, the Financial Services Authority said it was investigating both the bank and four current and former senior employees, including finance director Chris Lucas. Resignation Barclays is currently experiencing one of the most stormy times in its recent history. It was fined £290m by UK and US regulators for manipulating Libor, an interbank lending rate which affects mortgages and loans. Chief executive Bob Diamond resigned in the wake of the affair. Barclays has also been caught up in another investigation, relating to the mis-selling of complex financial products - interest rate swaps - to small businesses.","Barclays says the UK's Serious Fraud Office has started an investigation into payments between the bank and Qatar Holding LLC, part of sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority."
"The annual report from consumer group Which? found that in most cases, less than half of all passengers were pleased with their journeys. The most common complaint was ticket prices, with eight in 10 people saying fares were too high. But train companies insisted that most passengers were satisfied overall. Other frequent complaints included delays, having to stand, and poor toilet facilities. The Which? survey found that 11 of the 19 train companies it investigated had customer satisfaction rates of less than 50%. The poorest operators were Greater Anglia and Southeastern, both of which scored just 40%. However, Merseyrail, which runs services in the Liverpool area, scored well, with 70% of its customers saying they were happy with the journey they had just undertaken. Satisfaction levels steady The industry body, the Rail Delivery Group, responded by saying that most passengers were happy with the standard of service. Referring to January's survey by watchdog Passenger Focus, it said ""four out of five passengers were satisfied with their overall journey"". ""We are always keen to get feedback from customers, whether good or bad, which has helped the industry attract record numbers of passengers and cut complaints by three quarters in a decade,"" a spokesman said. The twice-a-year National Rail Passenger Survey from Passenger Focus showed that overall satisfaction levels have remained steady since 2009. Some 83% of passengers questioned in the autumn of 2013 said they were satisfied with their total journey. Of these, 89% of leisure travellers were happy, but only 77% of commuters were satisfied, the survey indicated.","Customer satisfaction with Britain's train services is ""shockingly low"", according to a survey of more than 7,000 passengers."
"It prompted the airline to accuse them of sabotaging rescue talks with potential investors. The airline filed for insolvency in August after its main shareholder, Gulf carrier Etihad, withdrew financial support. Domestic and international flights have been affected, stranding passengers. 'Playing with fire' Lufthansa's low cost subsidiary, Eurowings, which is renting aircraft and pilots from Air Berlin, also had to cancel flights. Chief executive Thomas Winkelmann said the pilots in question were ""playing with fire"". Some 200 of its 1,500 pilots suddenly called in sick. Reports in the German media have said that the airline is in a dispute with its pilots about the transfer of staff to a new owner. The action comes ahead of a Friday deadline for interested bidders to submit offers to take over parts of the carrier. Mr Winkelmann said: ""This day is costing us several million euros. ""We are in the middle of final negotiations with potential investors. Stable operations are a prerequisite for the success of these negotiations. ""That's the only way we can secure as many jobs as possible,"" he added. 'Fear and anger' The airline has been struggling for some time and over the past two years has announced losses amounting to 1.2bn euros (£1.1bn). In an internal memo, chief operations officer Oliver Iffert said: ""We must return to stable operations. That is crucial in order to bring talks with investors to a successful conclusion. ""Today is a day that threatens the existence of Air Berlin."" Germany's giant services sector union Verdi expressed solidarity with the absent pilots and warned that more workers could call in sick. Verdi board member Christine Behle said: ""All the conversations surrounding insolvent Air Berlin are always about its economic interests, never about the jobs of its more than 8,000 employees. ""The fear and anger among Air Berlin staff is escalating because the future of whole families are at stake."" The German government has agreed to provide a bridging loan of 150m euros to keep the airline flying for three months during the busy summer season.","Insolvent airline Air Berlin, Germany's second-largest carrier, has cancelled around 100 flights after a large number of its pilots called in sick."
"The Bank also left interest rates unchanged at 0.5%. Incoming Bank governor Mark Carney has said he is open to reviewing the UK's monetary policy framework. The Bank of England sets interest rates to achieve a certain level of inflation, but some believe its remit should include focusing on growth. The Bank has a 2% target for inflation on the consumer prices index (CPI) measure, and has leeway of one percentage point either side of that. Mr Carney, who replaces Sir Mervyn King in July, told a panel of MPs on Thursday: ""Flexible inflation targeting, in my opinion, is the most successful monetary policy framework that has been in existence. And so the bar for change to that framework, the overall framework, is very high. ""But I would note that there seems to be an appetite for some debate about what exactly the framework is, and what alternatives could be to it, and that should be encouraged."" On Wednesday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the Bank should consider injecting more money into the economy if growth remains weak. However, some policymakers have questioned the effectiveness of QE - which involves the central bank pumping billions of pounds into the financial system, creating money to buy back government bonds. Bank statement The UK economy shrank by 0.3% in the final three months of 2012, and the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it had taken that into account at its most recent meeting. ""The committee discussed the appropriate policy response to the combination of the weakness in the economy and the prospect of a further prolonged period of above-target inflation,"" it said in a statement. ""It agreed that, as long as domestic cost and price pressures remained consistent with inflation returning to the target in the medium term, it was appropriate to look through the temporary, albeit protracted, period of above-target inflation."" Inflation has remained above the Bank's 2% target since the end of 2009. The Bank added: ""The MPC's remit is to deliver price stability, but to do so in a way that avoids undesirable volatility in output. The committee judged that its policy stance was fully consistent with that remit. ""The committee agreed that it stood ready to provide additional monetary stimulus if warranted by the outlook for growth and inflation."" Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said no change in interest rates or on quantitative easing was no surprise. ""The weak fourth quarter is unlikely to have swayed further members into more QE action and, if anything, some survey indicators have been a little better at the start of the year,"" she said. Meanwhile the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (Niesr) estimates that UK economic output was unchanged in the three months to January. Niesr, which correctly predicted the 0.3% fall in output in the three months to December, expects annual growth of 0.7% this year and 1.5% in 2014.","The Bank of England has chosen not to inject any more money into the economy, leaving its quantitative easing (QE) programme at £375bn."
"The planemaker's chief executive, Tom Enders, said Airbus ""will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK"" in the event of no deal. He said it was a ""disgrace"" that firms could still not plan for Brexit. His remarks were welcomed by Business Minister Richard Harrington, who said Airbus was correct to warn of the dangers of a no-deal scenario. ""Crashing out is a disaster for business,"" Mr Harrington told a meeting at the German embassy on Thursday morning. ""Airbus is correct to say it publicly about and I'm delighted they have done so,"" he added. In all, Airbus employs 14,000 people in the UK. That includes 6,000 jobs at its main wings factory at Broughton in Wales, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Mr Enders said: ""Please don't listen to the Brexiteers' madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong."" Responding to Airbus's statement, a government spokesperson said: ""The UK is a world leader in aerospace. We are the home of the jet engine, the wing factory of the world and are world-renowned for our skills and capabilities in the most technically-advanced parts of aerospace manufacturing. ""It remains our top priority to leave the EU with a good deal; a deal that is good for business, will protect jobs and prosperity, and provide the certainty that business needs."" Recent moves Airbus's latest intervention follows announcements by two other companies that they were moving their headquarters out of the UK. Sony said it would transfer its European HQ from the UK to the Netherlands to avoid disruptions caused by Brexit. And appliance maker Dyson announced it was moving its headquarters to Singapore, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire, although it said the decision had nothing to do with Brexit. However, another firm, Japanese technology company Fujitsu, told the BBC it had ""zero intention"" of moving its operations out of London. Duncan Tait, Fujitsu's European boss, said it had ""a thriving business in the UK"", adding: ""We're recruiting people every week."" Mr Enders said that while the world's second-largest aerospace group could not ""pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately"", Airbus could be ""forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""And make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft,"" he added. ""Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital."" Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president of Airbus in the UK, reinforced Mr Enders' message. She told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" for her business, with ""chaos at the borders"" that would hold up delivery of vital components. This is not the first time that Airbus has warned of the consequences for its business of a no-deal Brexit. Last year, it issued a risk assessment saying that if the UK left the EU without a withdrawal deal, it ""would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK and its long-term footprint in the country"". However, Mr Enders' latest remarks suggest that the firm has toughened its stance since then. MPs are putting forward alternative plans to Theresa May's Brexit plan after it was voted down by Parliament last week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year. Analysis by Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent The gloves are off. That's the clear message from Airbus' pugnacious chief executive, Tom Enders. Opposition to Brexit from Airbus is not new. The company warned of the potential dangers to its business even before the referendum had taken place. Since then, the rhetoric has been steadily ramped up. Last year, the company published a ""Brexit Risk Assessment"", in which it warned that leaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic"" for its business. We've had warnings about the risk to future investment before, but now the threat is much more explicit and the language is much more forthright. The failure to come up with a clear plan is a ""disgrace"". Other countries would ""love"" to build the aircraft wings currently made at Broughton. There's even a warning not to listen to ""the Brexiteers' madness"". The time for diplomacy, it seems, is past. So what's changed? The company clearly believes that the risk of ""no deal"" is growing, thanks to the impasse in the House of Commons. And as a business which relies on the rapid transfer of parts from the UK to assembly lines in France and Germany, it is very exposed to any delays in shipments - or problems getting new safety certification. Meanwhile, Tom Enders is due to leave his job in April. So perhaps he's in a very good position to talk tough, without worrying whom he's upsetting in the process.

"By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News You'd imagine that any secret service worth its salt would be interested in who buys what maps from specialist UK retailer Stanfords. Home to the world's largest collection of maps, travel books and globes, its customers include governments and armed forces from around the world. So if two countries really don't get along, and one of them is buying a lot of detailed maps of the other from Stanfords, it might be time for alarm bells to be going off in the second of those two nations. ""We have a number of military customers around the world,"" says current boss Vivien Godfrey diplomatically. Based in Covent Garden, in the centre of London, family-owned Stanfords is a 166-year-old British institution. Opening its doors in 1853, it harks back to the great expeditions of the 19th and early 20th Centuries. Its famous customers from that time included David Livingstone, who explored much of Africa, and Ernest Shackleton, who led expeditions to Antarctica. Even fictional character Sherlock Holmes was a fan. Vivien, 58, has been chief executive and chairman of Stanfords since March 2018, but her connection to the business has been a lifelong one. Her family have been majority owners since 1946, and she is now the third generation to lead the company. She describes Stanfords as having ""been part of my entire life"". However, when she graduated from Oxford University with a degree in geography in 1983, her father wouldn't let her join the family firm. ""He very firmly told me 'no, you should go off and work for other companies, and get other experiences',"" she recalls. ""He said that at some point I was going to get more involved in the Stanfords business, and I would be more valuable if I had other experiences."" So after Oxford she spent seven years working for management consultancy group McKinsey, where she helped clients ""almost entirely in retail and consumer goods"". ""Part of the reason I asked to work almost solely with retail clients was that I thought it would give me the greatest benefit [for Stanfords in the future],"" she says. In 1991 she moved to US, where she spent eight years based in Minnesota, working for then retail group Grand Metropolitan (later Diageo). Two of the main brands she focused on were canned vegetables business Green Giant, and ice cream subsidiary Haagen-Dazs. Vivien's decision to finally take up the top job at Stanfords 19 months ago came as the business was having some difficulties. Its old, three-storey store on Long Acre, Covent Garden, which had been open since 1901, was by then far too big for the company. As a result, Stanfords was making a loss, and its future was at risk. The company's former chief executive had resigned, and Vivien had tasked herself with finding both a replacement boss, and a new, smaller premises. But as she got more involved, she says she realised that it was finally time for her to take up the top position. ""I just felt that it was the right moment, that I was ready to do this,"" she says. So taking charge she successfully found a new smaller premises for Stanfords' main store, in a new development just 100m away. The company moved in January of this year. Vivien adds that the business, which is set to see revenues of up to £10m in its current financial year, has already now returned to profitability. ""We are now trading in roughly 5,000 sq ft (465 sq m) and previously we were at about 7,000,"" she says. ""Some of our regular customers were disappointed. But when either I, or members of staff, explained to them that it was a question of either remaining where we were and going out of business, or leaving and thriving, everyone understood."" More The Boss features: While Stanfords has long had an online and telephone sales operation, bricks and mortar still account for 80% of its sales. In addition to its core London shop, it has a second store in Bristol, and an outlet at the headquarters of the Royal Geographical Society, also in the UK capital. Another small store also recently opened in a new market development in Covent Garden, and a shop is planned for Manchester. Currently the business employs 55 people. ""Bricks and mortar retailing still has a bright future, but the shops have to be the right size,"" she says. ""That is key."" Now exporting 20% of its maps, travel books and globes, Vivien says that maps make up between 40% and 50% of its turnover. And that the split between physical and digital maps is half and half. Vivien says she is untroubled by Google offering free maps on line. ""People will always be happy to pay for really detailed, really specialist, made-to-order maps,"" she says. And she is dismissive of online-only retailers like Amazon. ""We pride ourselves on offering the best possible customer service, Amazon offers none."" Travel industry expert Mike Bugsgang says that Stanfords ""is a London institution like Fortnum & Mason or Liberty"". ""We are constantly being reminded of the frailties of the retail sector in the face of the seemingly inextricable growth of online sales by companies such as Amazon,"" he says. ""However, a major advantage that Stanfords has in the highly competitive book sales sector is its heritage. The store is an attraction for tourists and Londoners alike."" With many of Stanfords' customers about to go travelling overseas, Vivien says that the company is set to launch a carbon offsetting scheme. She say she will be using this herself, as her family home is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She and her American husband moved to Florida in 2001 when they purchased a business called Bluewater Books and Charts, which Vivien describes as ""the Stanfords of the sea"". While her partner continues to run Bluewater, she spends three weeks out of every four in London leading Stanfords. ""It obviously isn't ideal,"" she says. ""But we email each other every morning to say what we are up to that day, and then we Facetime every evening."" Regarding the military customers, Vivien says that while they all switched to digital maps 10 or so years ago, they are now rushing back to paper ones. ""You just don't get any perspective if you are looking at a map on a small screen,"" she says. ""And the batteries on handheld devices run out, especially in very cold environments.""","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Vivien Godfrey, chief executive of maps and travel books retailer Stanfords."
"By Philip AugarAuthor and former investment banker Deals at today's price are called the ""spot"" market and bets can also be made on forward exchange rates. In all, $5.3 trillion (£3.3tn) was traded per day on the forex markets in 2013, according to the Bank for International Settlements. To put that in context, that's just over double the annual economic output of the UK, which was $2.52tn in 2013, according to the World Bank. Why is it so big? Currency trading started out as a way for businesses and individuals to change money for overseas travel and commerce. This was a real service industry driven by the underlying level of world trade. Opportunities for speculation were limited by the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944 to peg exchange rates to the gold price. In the early 1970s, this accord broke down, exchange rates began to fluctuate more widely and globalisation created more underlying demand for foreign exchange. Financial institutions saw a new opportunity to make money from the increased size and volatility of the forex market. Today only a fraction of currency trading is directly related to the original purpose of facilitating cross-border trade: the rest is speculative. How does it work? There is no physical forex marketplace and nearly all trading takes place on electronic systems operated by the big banks and other providers. Dealers display the prices at which they are prepared to buy and sell currencies: users place orders with the click of a mouse. Prices change according to supply and demand. For example, if the US dollar is more popular than the euro at any given time, the dollar will strengthen against the euro and vice versa. Prices are constantly changing on a second-by-second basis as currencies respond to the changing flow of economic news. About 40% of the world's dealing goes through trading rooms in London. What is the fix? Prices in the forex market change so rapidly that it is difficult to establish the going rate for particular currencies at any one time. In order to help businesses and investors value their multi-currency assets and liabilities, a daily exchange rate fix is held. Until recently, this was based on actual currency deals that took place in a window 30 seconds before and 30 seconds after 16:00 London time. WM-Reuters then calculated the fix rates based on these observed transactions, which form the benchmarks for that day. The probity of this public information is very important, as it is the peg on which many other financial markets depend. How was the fix rigged? Because the fix was based on actual transactions over a short period of time, the potential existed for market players to get together and place orders during the 60-second window. If they were big enough, they could affect the benchmark calculation and create profit opportunities for their firms. Last November, regulators said that some forex traders at five of the biggest banks had been doing just that for several years. They concluded that through online chat rooms with exotic names such as The Bandits Club, The Cartel and The Mafia, traders colluded to place aggressive ""buy"" or ""sell"" orders - known in the business as ""banging the close""- in order to distort the fix. Shouldn't it have been detected sooner? This had apparently been going on for several years. Embarrassingly for the managers meant to have been in charge of the traders, suspicious price movements were first highlighted by a whistleblower. Clues that were available to outsiders should have been picked up internally long ago, but prime responsibility lies with those who participated directly. The practice appears to have been so common amongst influential traders that the phrase Warren Buffett described as the five most dangerous words in business, ""everyone else is doing it"", comes to mind. Has any action been taken since? The Financial Stability Board, a watchdog that advises the G20 finance ministers, has set up a task force to recommend reforms of the forex market. As a result, the window in which the daily 4pm fix is calculated has been extended from one minute to five minutes. This makes it harder to manipulate. In addition to the five minute fix, the central banks' co-ordinator - the Bank for International Settlements - is trying to get all the banks to agree a unified code of conduct, but this has not yet been settled. Was there a regulatory failing? Ironically, the forex market had been considered by regulators too big to be manipulated and it has been largely unregulated. Yet there were some early warning signs that all was not well. Minutes of a meeting of dealers at the Bank of England back in 2006 appear to suggest that the possibility of market manipulation was discussed in front of officials, but the Bank of England denies this interpretation. Nine years on, it has led global regulators in cleaning up the forex market - and not before time, critics will say. Can such scandals be prevented? Institutional cheating of the kind we have seen in the Libor and forex scandals will probably die out for a while. Individual traders have seen colleagues marched off the trading floor to face questioning. Managers have finally understood the need for line-by-line, desk-by-desk scrutiny. Regulators now know that light-touch regulation was an invitation to the financial services industry to game the rules and they have responded with more intrusive supervision and hefty deterrents. Against this background, it would be surprising if systemic malpractice were to continue in the immediate future. But there is no room for complacency in an industry where corporate memories are short and rewards for beating the market are great. Philip Augar is a former investment banker and the author of several books on the City.","The foreign exchange, or forex, market is a virtual trading place where dealers buy and sell currencies."
"By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy That is the language of computers. Every clever thing your computer does - make a call, search a database, play a game - comes down to ones and zeroes. Actually, it comes down to the presence (one) or absence (zero) of a current in tiny transistors on a semiconductor chip. Thankfully, we do not have to program computers in zeroes and ones. Microsoft Windows, for example, uses 20GB, or 170 billion ones and zeroes. Printed out, the stack of A4 paper would be two and a half miles (4km) high. Imagine setting every transistor manually. Ignoring how fiddly this would be - transistors measure just billionths of a metre - if it took a second to flip each switch, installing Windows would take 5,000 years. Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Early computers really were programmed rather like this. Consider the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, later known as the Harvard Mark 1. It was a 15m-long (50ft), 2.5m-high concatenation of wheels, shafts, gears and switches. It contained 530 miles (850km) of wires. It whirred away under instruction from a roll of perforated paper tape. If you wanted it to solve a new equation, you had to work out which switches should be on or off, which wires should be plugged in where. Then, you had to flip all the switches, plug all the wires, and punch all the holes in the paper tape. Programming it was not just difficult, but involved tedious, repetitive and error-prone manual labour. Four decades on from the Harvard Mark 1, more compact and user-friendly machines such as the Commodore 64 found their way into schools. You may remember the childhood thrill of typing this: ""Hello world"" would fill the screen, in chunky, low-resolution text. You had instructed the computer in words that were recognisably, intuitively human. It seemed like a minor miracle. Mathematical brilliance One reason for computers' astonishing progression since the Mark 1 is certainly ever-tinier components. But it is also because programmers can write software in human-like language, and have it translated into the ones and zeroes, the currents or not-currents, that ultimately do the work. The thing that began to make that possible was called a compiler. And behind the compiler was a woman called Grace Hopper. Nowadays, there is much discussion about how to get more women into tech. In 1906, when Grace was born, not many people cared about gender equality. Fortunately for Grace, her father wanted his daughters to get the same education as his son. Sent to a good school, Grace turned out to be brilliant at maths. Her grandfather was a rear admiral, and her childhood dream was to join the US Navy, but girls were not allowed. Unwieldy contraption Then, in 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into World War Two. Male talent was called away. The US Navy started taking women. Grace signed up at once. If you are wondering why the navy needs mathematicians, consider aiming a missile. At what angle and direction should you fire? The answer depends on many things: target distance, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. These are not complex calculations, but they were time-consuming for a human ""computer"" armed only with pen and paper. As Lt (junior grade) Hopper graduated from midshipmen's school in 1944, the navy was intrigued by the potential of an unwieldy machine recently devised by Harvard professor Howard Aiken - the Mark 1. The navy sent Lt Hopper to help Prof Aiken work out what it could do. Prof Aiken was not thrilled to have a female join the team, but Lt Hopper impressed him enough that he asked her to write the operating manual. This involved plenty of trial and error. More often than not, the Mark 1 would grind to a halt soon after starting - and there was no user-friendly error message. Once, it was because a moth had flown into the machine - that gave us the modern term ""debugging"". More often, the bug was metaphorical - a wrongly flipped switch, a mispunched hole in the paper tape. The detective work was laborious and dull. More from Tim Harford The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The simple steel box that transformed global trade How the barcode changed retailing Why the falling cost of light matters Lt Hopper and her colleagues started filling notebooks with bits of tried-and-tested, re-useable code. By 1951, computers had advanced enough to store these chunks - called ""subroutines"" - in their own memory systems. By then, Grace was working for a company called Remington Rand. She tried to persuade her employers to let programmers call up these subroutines in familiar words - to say things such as: ""Subtract income tax from pay."" She later said: ""No-one thought of that earlier, because they weren't as lazy as I was."" In fact, Grace was famed for hard work. But what Grace called a ""compiler"" did involve a trade-off. It made programming quicker, but the resulting programmes ran more slowly. That is why Remington Rand were not interested. Every customer had their own, bespoke requirements for their shiny new computing machine. It made sense, the company thought, for its experts to program them as efficiently as they could. Open source Grace was not discouraged: she simply wrote the first compiler in her spare time. And others loved how it helped them to think more clearly. Kurt Beyer's book, Grace Hopper and the Invention of the Information Age, relates many tales of impressed users. One of them was an engineer called Carl Hammer, who used the compiler to attack an equation his colleagues had struggled with for months. Mr Hammer wrote 20 lines of code, and solved it in a day. Like-minded programmers all over the US started sending Grace new chunks of code, and she added them to the library for the next release. In effect, she was single-handedly pioneering open-source software. Grace's compiler evolved into one of the first programming languages, COBOL. More fundamentally, it paved the way for the now-familiar distinction between hardware and software. With one-of-a-kind machines such as the Harvard Mark 1, software was hardware. No pattern of switches would also work on another machine, which would be wired completely differently. But if a computer can run a compiler, it can also run any program that uses it. Further layers of abstraction have since come to separate human programmers from the nitty-gritty of physical chips. And each one has taken a further step in the direction Grace realised made sense: freeing up programmer brainpower to think about concepts and algorithms, not switches and wires. Grace had her own views of why colleagues had been initially resistant: not because they cared about making programs run more quickly, but because they enjoyed the prestige of being the only ones who could communicate with the godlike computer. The ""high priests"", Grace called them. She thought anyone should be able to programme. Now, anyone can. And computers are far more useful because of it.

"By Ian WestbrookBBC Business reporter Bill Grimsey, former head of Wickes, Iceland and Focus DIY, launches his second report into the future of town centres and High Streets on Wednesday. He told the BBC: ""We must act now. ""Forget retail for town centres, they need to become community hubs based on health, education, entertainment, leisure and arts and crafts."" Mr Grimsey's report says that facilities such as libraries and digital and health hubs should be part of the offering to bring back people to town centres, together with housing and some independent shops. And he explained to the BBC: ""We are social animals. We need gathering places as otherwise we are going to have a generation of very lonely people growing up."" Retailers on UK High Streets have been hit by weak sales, online competition and rising costs, affecting 22,000 jobs this year. High-profile failures include Maplin and Toys R Us while High Street chains such as Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser, Carphone Warehouse, New Look and Carpetright have announced store closure plans. Meanwhile, the British Retail Consortium has called for a two-year freeze on business rates increases to help provide some financial relief for the retail industry. ""The retail industry, the UK's largest private sector employer, makes up 5% of the economy and pays nearly 25% of the overall business rates bill, over £7bn per year,"" it said. ""This is a disproportionate burden and is leading to decisions to close stores, while at the same time getting in the way of the modernisation and reinvention of Britain's High Streets."" 'Unique history' Mr Grimsey's original report was published in 2013 after he disagreed with the findings of a different study by retail expert Mary Portas. One place which followed his recommendations was Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east of England. Neil Schneider, chief executive of the town's borough council, says: ""The vision for Stockton was to develop a big outdoor community centre. ""In our plan we wanted to capitalise on the area's unique history and heritage, support a wide range of retailers and businesses, and improve the connections to the attractive riverside. ""By developing safe evening and leisure opportunities in interesting spaces, we wanted to ensure that people don't come to Stockton just to shop. We really wanted to create a community hub destination."" Free parking Near the end of 2017, Mr Grimsey decided to publish a second edition of his report and he is confident that it could have a more widespread positive outcome. He has had support from Conservative MP Jake Berry, as well as Andy Street, the first mayor of the West Midlands who was the managing director of John Lewis, the department store group. ""All I want to do is help make a difference and I think that this time around, it will get traction. Political figures are joining in and it's a clarion call for action."" The new report has 25 recommendations in three sections, which cover: Mr Grimsey puts the High Street's decline down to the growth in popularity of out-of-town shopping centres with their free parking, as well as online shopping. But he dismissed the idea that free or cheaper parking being reintroduced into High Streets would revitalise them. ""If it was that simple then people would have done it already,"" he said. ""The point is that the retail proposition in town centres has been overtaken by the more convenient out-of-town parks. The town centres should say 'let them have it'. ""In my generation as retailers, we successfully cloned every town in Britain so they all looked the same, but clearly that doesn't work. ""All the towns have a heritage and history and their reason for uniqueness needs to be brought to the fore. ""We need to repopulate these places and local authorities are the key to unlocking this, along with good leadership. Where it happens it can work.""","Britain's town centres are ""in big danger of becoming ghost towns in the future"" if immediate action is not taken, warns a former retail chief."
"By Joe MillerBusiness reporter But as Russia looks likely to enter a deep recession - fuelled by plummeting oil prices and the plunging rouble - the West has remained sanguine about the potential impact on global finances. Heavyweights like the US and UK would argue they have little to worry about, for despite its political importance, Russia accounts for just 3% of global economic output, and an even smaller portion of world trade. However there are several individual companies, and even countries, for whom Russia's decline is very bad news indeed. Major banks in Austria, France and Italy have much of their value tied up in the country. Global brands such as Carlsberg, Adidas and Pepsi sell a lot to Russian consumers. And some former Soviet states, such as Lithuania and Latvia, rely heavily on exports to Russia, while others benefit from money sent back home from citizens working in the country. Banking on Russia France's Societe Generale has 62% of its tangible equity (the funds of its core operations) tied up in Russia, according to research by Citigroup, while Italy's UniCredit has 40%. Austria's Raiffeisen bank, one of the largest lenders operating in Eastern Europe, announced on Thursday that its capital ratio, a measure of a bank's financial strength, had already declined because of the rouble crisis. Away from the financial sector, it is not just oil companies with interests in Russia, such as BP, who are feeling the pinch. Companies that sell food, alcohol, cigarettes and beauty products to Russians are increasingly feeling the effects of the country's decline. Danish brewing firm Carlsberg, which sells almost four out of every 10 beers in Russia, saw its share price fall by almost 20% in the past few weeks due to concerns about its exposure to eastern Europe. Drinks maker Pepsi, beauty company Avon and French firm Danone - of yoghurt and baby food fame - all export considerable amounts to Russia too. Meanwhile US tobacco firm Philip Morris, which sells almost a quarter of all cigarettes in Russia, has seen its shares decimated in the past month. Rocky rides Carmakers around the world are also beginning to worry. US auto firm General Motors has temporarily suspended sales in Russia, following in the tracks of Audi and Jaguar Land Rover. The volatility of the rouble has made pricing increasingly difficult. And German firm BMW may lose as much as €100m because of the rouble's decline, according to Bloomberg, while several other European firms, including Renault, Volkswagen and Daimler, could face similar fates. Additionally, if Russia reacts to the crisis by imposing restrictions on imports to the country, the manufacturers of car components, such as tyre-maker Nokian Renkaat, would be heavily hit. Indeed, investors have been betting against the Finnish firm, with up to a fifth of all its shares handed over to short sellers, according to Reuters. Short sellers borrow shares in order to sell them, expecting to buy them back at a lower price. Nightmare neighbours Closer to home, many former Soviet countries are watching Russia's misfortunes nervously. Back in August, three IMF officials warned that while most of Europe would not suffer too much from a downturn in Russia's economy, ""for many of Russia's immediate neighbours such as Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, and the Baltics, whose exports to Russia exceed 5 percent of their respective GDP, the impact could be substantial"". Moldova - one of the poorest countries in Europe - relies on money sent back by citizens working in Russia for almost a quarter of its GDP. The decline of the rouble will mean the funds flowing back into the country are greatly diminished. But however badly individual countries or companies may fare, the leaders of the world's largest economies can sleep quite easily. ""The negative effects of the Russia crisis will be concentrated on a small number of countries and companies with direct exposure to Russia,"" says Andrew Kenningham, senior global economist at Capital Economics. ""If you think about the future of the UK economy, for example, the impact of events in Russia is likely to be of negligible importance"".","In the 21st Century, no economy is an island, entire of itself."
"According to research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) this could be because an increasing number now serve food, which is more labour intensive. More than 11,000 pubs have closed, leaving around 39,000 across the UK, the ONS said. Some areas on the edges of big cities have seen pub numbers halve since 2001. Low pay The ONS found that the number of jobs in pubs dipped during the economic downturn. However, employment in the sector picked up subsequently and there are now 6% more jobs in pubs and bars than there were in 2008. The largest increases have been in bigger pubs (those with 10 or more employees). This may be because serving food requires more waiting and kitchen staff. The rise in employment has been more pronounced in rural pubs, where in 2018 total employment in England and Wales is 17% higher compared with 2008. In contrast, employment in urban pubs rose by only 4% over the same period. But most jobs in the sector are low paid with around 70% of workers in pubs and bars being paid less than the Living Wage Foundation's recommended Living Wage. This is set at £10.55 per hour in London and £9 per hour elsewhere. The ONS's analysis shows it is small pubs that are disappearing, while the bigger chains are consolidating around larger bars. The closure of British pubs is a well-known story. Organisations such as the Campaign for Real Ale and the British Beer and Pub Association have charted the disappearance of pubs for many years, citing reasons including rising overheads, the smoking ban and the rise of cheaper alcohol sold in supermarkets. Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Luton - all in and around London - now have fewer than half the pubs they did in 2001. There are far fewer pubs in some towns around Manchester, including Burnley, Bolton and Rochdale, as well as on the outskirts of Birmingham, in areas including Sandwell, Dudley and Walsall. On the other hand, locations popular with tourists, including the Highlands of Scotland, Blackpool and Brighton, either have seen pub numbers increase or hold steady. The ONS's report, called ""Economies of ale"", includes an interactive map, which can be used to see changes in pub numbers and employment in your area.","Pubs are employing more people than 10 years ago, despite almost a quarter of them having closed over the same period, official figures show."
"The Eurostat estimate shows the inflation rate moving further away from the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of just below 2%. In November, the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, reflecting the low inflation outlook. The ECB will gather for its latest meeting later this week, although no changes to policy are expected. The latest data may fuel concerns that the eurozone risks a period of deflation, in which consumers delay purchases in the expectation that prices will fall further. Last week, ECB president Mario Draghi said there were no signs of deflation or an urgent need for another rate cut. But he added that it was important that inflation did not get stuck permanently below 1%. Peter Vanden Houte, ING's chief eurozone economist, said: ""Today's figures show that it's too early for the ECB to become complacent about deflation risks, especially in peripheral countries."" The euro rose to $1.3646 from $1.3618 on speculation the ECB might take more action to support the eurozone' economy. 'Weakest' In October, the eurozone's inflation rate fell to 0.7%, the first time it had dropped below 1% since February 2010. This prompted the rate cut from the ECB. In Tuesday's figures, analysts highlighted the ""core"" rate of inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco. This fell to an all-time low of 0.7%. ""It constitutes the weakest reading on record and reflects a marked slowdown in services price inflation,"" said James Ashley, senior economist at RBC Capital Markets. The worry is that muted wage rises and high unemployment in the eurozone will continue to force prices lower. Meanwhile, the relatively high value of the euro has made imports cheaper, while making exports more expensive. Eurostat also released industrial producer price data for November, showing a 0.1% fall on the month after a 0.5% drop in October.","The eurozone's inflation rate fell to 0.8% in December, official figures have shown, down from 0.9% in November."
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter They fear they are too big for a new interest-free loan scheme, but not credit-worthy enough for a Bank of England finance option. One firm falling through the cracks is Pure Gym. It employs just over 1,500 workers across 265 sites, as well as providing work for 3,500 self-employed personal trainers. ""We're much too large for the new smaller companies' scheme, but for the larger company scheme you have to have an investment rating to apply,"" boss Humphrey Cobbold told the BBC's Today programme. There are two elements to the government rescue package announced on Monday. First is a new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme which is aimed at helping small and medium-sized companies by allowing them to borrow up to £5m at preferential rates. ""Viable businesses"" can apply for a 12-month interest-free loan, 80% of which will be guaranteed by the government. Companies with a larger turnover can take advantage of the Bank of England's new Covid Corporate Financing Facility. That's effectively a government promise to buy short-term IOUs from companies that are investment grade: in short those with a very high credit rating. Where to find out more: ""We're actually caught in the middle between both schemes. They're not really open to us,"" Mr Cobbold said. But like many other companies, Pure Gym faces some difficult financial decisions. ""Following the prime minister's announcement on Friday, we had to take a business that has taken 10 years to build and close it down in 10 hours,"" Mr Cobbold said. ""We burn cash at a rate of about £9m-£10m a week, so we have quite a task to drive down that burn rate so we can make our cash and liquidity last as long as we can."" There are thousands of businesses that could fall between the two stools, it is reckoned. For instance, most High Street chains won't qualify, such as the likes of M&S, Boots, WH Smith and Pret a Manger. The UK hospitality and retail sector employs 3.2 million people, more than any other sector in the economy. But most of that industry won't be eligible. ""We know that businesses are in urgent need of access to funding during these unprecedented times,"" Business Minister Alok Sharma said. ""The Business Interruption Scheme will make it easier for banks to lend and businesses to borrow."" One firm that is facing desperate times is Leicester-based Koban Restaurant Group. It has seven restaurants employing 120 workers but all have now closed. ""We had no option but to shut down our restaurants with heavy losses,"" owner Raghu Kodakandala told the Today programme. He says the restaurants are not geared up to continue as takeaways - as others have done - because they concentrate on fine dining and steaks and grills. He said he's had to ask his staff to go on unpaid leave. ""As a small company I only have the resource to support them until the end of the month. After that I don't have the cashflow to help them out."" He's desperate to raise some money to help him through the difficult times ahead, but says he's had no joy at the banks. ""I would like to apply for one of the government guaranteed loans, but when I approached some of the partner banks they didn't know how the scheme would be rolled out,"" he said. Banks should have more clarity after the details of the Government's business rescue package were published. The Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan is available through the British Business Bank. ""Businesses can access the finance through more than 40 accredited lenders, including high street banks and asset finance companies based all over country,"" Keith Morgan, the chief executive of the British Business Bank, told the Today programme. He said there are a range of different financing solutions offered, from smaller working capital loans to larger asset loans. For companies facing an immediate cashflow crisis, he said: ""We would expect money to start flowing this week."" Meanwhile there's a possible ray of hope for firms caught in the cracks: the Treasury said further measures would be announced to ensure large and medium-sized businesses had access to the credit they need.","The government's £330bn rescue package for British businesses doesn't go far enough, some firms have warned."
"The filings brought the total number of new jobless claims since the middle of March to more than 36 million. That amounts to nearly a quarter of the American workforce. The weekly figures have been falling since the end of March but remain massive by historic standards, eclipsing the prior record of 700,000. ""Today's unemployment claims continue their epic ascent on a cumulative weekly basis; not since the Great Depression has the US job market been in such a sorry state,"" said Richard Flynn, UK managing director at Charles Schwab. The head of America's central bank warned this week that the economic recovery is likely to be slower than initially hoped. In April, employers cut more than 20 million jobs, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7% and erasing nearly a decade of job gains. While the losses have fallen hardest on minority and low-income households, they have touched every part of the economy. However, economists said they believe hiring will start to pick up as more states ease restrictions on activity. The increase in the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended 9 May was ""relatively modest"", noted Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""With most states only beginning to ease their lockdowns over the last 10 days, we expect a much bigger swing in hiring versus firing over the next couple of weeks, which suggests the unemployment rate will begin to drop back,"" he said. ""Being laid off hit me out of the blue Nickolas Ray, 30, IT consultant in Atlanta, Georgia: This is the first time I've been unemployed since I was 14. Being laid off kind of hit me out of the blue - in my company we thought we were all safe. Applying for unemployment has been frustrating. You have to fax your notice in to the Department of Labour - but I don't have a fax machine. And then the receiving fax machine also needs to have paper - with government offices mostly closed, it took me five times to send something through. I'm very lucky - I've always saved money, since I started working as a babysitter as a teenager, so I've socked away enough money to be OK for now. But if I catch Covid-19 and go to hospital, that whole plan would be disrupted. My biggest concern is how things are going to work if I have no health insurance anymore. I'm job hunting right now - everyone's very excited to talk, but unfortunately no one knows what's going to happen so there aren't any firm job openings.

"The €12.5m (£10.7m) fine concerns merchandise such as mugs, bed sheets and stationery, which carries the brand of the club, but not Nike's trademark. Manchester United and Barcelona goods were among those affected. The commission found Nike restricted firms who made and sold the products from selling them across borders. ""Football fans often cherish branded products from their favourite teams,"" said competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. ""Nike prevented many of its licensees from selling these branded products in a different country leading to less choice and higher prices for consumers."" As well as Manchester United and Barcelona, the commission said products bearing the brands of Juventus, Inter Milan and AS Roma were also affected, as well as national federations like the French Football Federation. The illegal practices occurred between 2004 to 2017, the commission said. Nike received a 40% discount on its fine for co-operating with the investigation. ""Nike co-operated with the commission beyond its legal obligation to do so, in particular by providing the commission with information that allowed it to extend the scope of the case,"" the commission said. ""As a result, the investigation included ancillary sport merchandise of a number of additional clubs.""",Nike has been fined by the European Commission for restricting the cross-border sale of goods carrying the logos of some of Europe's top football clubs.
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter It is difficult to imagine a more significant moment in the whole debate about the provision of health care in Britain. A spokesman for Circle - the company running Hinchingbrooke - told me that it was difficult to see how any private operation looking for a commercial return could run an acute services hospital under the present model. For those who object to private companies operating in the NHS, a response to the announcement this morning might well be ""good riddance"". It is worth, though, considering why the previous Labour government decided to offer the contract to run Hinchingbrooke to private operators. There is an argument that private companies bring a discipline to health service provision which can lead to better patient services, and staff relations, for lower costs. Any returns the company makes can then be shared with the NHS. In Circle's case, if it had made profits above £2m, anything above that would be split with the public sector. High risk The NHS has, of course, always been a mixture of public, private and voluntary provision. GPs are not state employees, for example, but independent contractors to the NHS. That mix is one many believe works when it comes to relatively predictable services such as elective operations. But Hinchingbrooke is different and became a test for the public/private model at the most visible level - the running of an entire hospital. It was certainly high risk. Before Circle took over the contract, Hinchingbrooke was a struggling hospital. It was labouring under £40m of debts and in 2009 the then Labour government decided to launch a process to bring in private providers. Circle, which is partly owned by its employees, won that bidding process. The fact it took three years (Circle did not take over Hinchingbrooke until 2012) reveals just how complicated the agreement was. And the more complicated a contract, the greater the risks attached. Demand spike Circle pledged to increase levels of care offered to local people, turn around the hospital's finances and create better staff relations. To an extent, and certainly at the beginning of the contract, there was some success. Waiting time targets were hit, patient feedback improved and efficiencies were made. The hospital's deficit fell from £10m in February 2012 to £3.5m in March 2013 to £1.5m in March last year. And Circle claims it saved the NHS £23m. But healthcare does not operate by the usual laws of supply and demand. Demand, as we have seen recently in accident and emergency services, can suddenly spike. And that can happen at the same time as supply - payments for each patient treated - falls. Circle said its payments had been cut by 10%. The result? Losses for Circle which have now reached £5m, the trigger point at which it can say it no longer wants to run the hospital. The business is also expected to be criticised by an imminent Care Quality Commission (CQC) report on its standards of health care. Circle may dispute the findings, but the CQC report would almost certainly have led to increased costs as new service levels were agreed. Today's announcement has revealed that under the present model, many believe there is a pretty simple answer to the question can a private business run an acute hospital. And it's no.",This morning the first - and only - private business to run an acute services hospital has announced it is pulling out.
"Fraudsters posted bogus adverts for pets, cars and caravans to dupe people into handing over money. Romance scams have also risen during the Covid crisis, affecting men and women of all ages. BBC local radio stations are highlighting the risks and giving tips to avoid becoming the next victim. Shopping danger In total, 389,328 fraud cases were reported by victims in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the 12 months to April, according to figures from reporting service Action Fraud, with total losses from all scams reaching £1.7bn. Fraud from online shopping was the most common type. The number of cases rose by 44% to 95,531 over the year - a time when many people turned to internet shopping with stores closed during lockdown. Scammers used social media and other channels to advertise items or pets, often with attractive pictures and prices, that never arrived after a deposit or full price was paid. Romance scams cases increased by 15% in the last year. Many people turned to online dating for the first time during lockdown. Some were tricked by fraudsters impersonating someone who the victims believed cared for them. Often, they pretended they had faced financial difficulties and needed emergency funds, but never repaid the money. The largest number (77,500) of scam reports overall came from 20 to 29-year-olds, the data shows. Young people, who use internet-connected technology most frequently, are being targeted but police officers stress that fraudsters are tricking people of all ages. Investigators also fear that many thousands of, predominantly older, people are too embarrassed to report becoming victims to scams. They are urging anyone who has been tricked to report their case quickly, to help catch those behind the schemes. The second most common method of fraud in the last year was so-called advance fee fraud. This includes a scam seen regularly during lockdown in which victims receive a bogus text which asks them to click on a link and pay a delivery fee. Among those caught out was Lou Osborn, from Keswick, who works in accounts herself. ""At the time [the text message] was not a surprise because on that day I had about five deliveries coming,"" she said. She phoned up the bank to alert them to what had happened, but then she got caught up in a web of calls, letters and texts from people claiming to be from the bank's fraud department and using a spoof phone number that looked like the bank's. Payments totalling thousands of pounds were made on her card, and she felt fortunate that her bank subsequently refunded the money. ""I felt really stupid. I am very wary of things. They are playing on the vulnerable,"" she said. ""It makes me really angry. To do that to somebody is just horrendous."" Other victims who have spoken to BBC local radio stations include a vicar in Wiltshire. He was impersonated by scammers who then emailed his parishioners and asked them to help him out with Amazon vouchers. One woman from the West Midlands who put up a lost dog poster spoke of how she was then blackmailed by fraudsters claiming to have her pet. They were lying. There are some key tips to help to avoid falling victim to such scams, according to the National Cyber Security Centre. They include: While these will not prevent all scam attempts, they should help to make technology more secure. A survey of 2,000 people by card issuer Marqeta found that 19% of those asked had become first-time victims of fraud in the past 12 months, a significant increase compared with a year earlier. This figure rose to 31% among 18 to 34-year-olds. Where to go for help Action Fraud is the service to report scams to - 0300 123 2040 Citizens Online has more than 400 digital champions and a free digital support helpline - 0808 196 5883 Citizens Advice has online and phone help for online scam concerns",Online shopping scams surged during the pandemic with police data suggesting people in their 20s were most likely to fall victim.
"Spain's public works minister Ana Pastor will fly to Panama this weekend, following a meeting between diplomats on Friday. Work began on the expansion of the shipping hub in 2009, but it has gone over-budget by $1.6bn (£1bn). The group behind the project, led by Spain's Sacyr, has threatened to halt work unless the extra money is paid. Sacyr's chairman Manuel Manrique will also fly to Panama to join in the negotiations. The building group, known as the Grupo Unidos por el Canal (GUPC), is made up of Spain's Sacyr, Italy's Salini Impreglio, Belgium's Jan De Nul, and Panama's Constructora Urbana. It is in the process of constructing a third lock which will allow bigger ships to pass through. It gave a 21 day deadline on 30 December to the Panama Canal Authority to make the extra $1.6 billion payment. If it doesn't, GUPC says it will stop work on the expansion plans. A spokesperson for Spain's foreign ministry said: ""Panama is a country that is close and friendly towards Spain, and we share the desire and interest to find a solution as soon as possible"". Spain's ambassador to Panama, Jesus Silva, added that all stand to lose out if the contract fell through. On Thursday, Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli threatened to demand that the building consortium fulfil its contract to expand the canal. The president said: ""I will go to Spain and Italy to demand these governments take moral responsibility."" Construction is due to be completed in June 2015, nine months behind schedule. The overall cost of the project now expected to be $5.2bn. Building work is now focused on the creation of a third set of locks to accommodate ships that can carry 12,000 containers. The largest ships currently able to navigate the Panama Canal carry 5,000. The Panama Canal handles 5% of the world's maritime trade.",The Spanish government is in talks with Panama to try to resolve a row over the expansion of the Panama Canal.
"The firm said it made $8.7bn in revenue in the three months to September, as deliveries rose 54%. The firm said it still hoped to meet its goal of delivering more than 500,000 vehicles this year but warned this had ""become more difficult"". Analysts also warned the firm faced mounting competition. So far, Tesla has delivered fewer than 320,00 cars to customers this year - but nearly half of those - 139,593 - came in the three months ended 30 September. That was up 54% from the prior quarter and 44% year-on-year. This helped lift the carmaker to a quarterly profit of $311m - more than double what it made during the same period last year. The firm's successful streak - at a time when many other automakers have been hit by the pandemic - has not gone unnoticed by investors who spent years lamenting the firm's lack of profits. Shares in the firm have more than quadrupled in value since the start of the year - and climbed higher in after-hours trade on Wednesday. Mounting competition The firm now boasts the highest market value of any carmaker in the world - despite selling far fewer vehicles than older rivals such as Toyota. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while the firm enjoyed ""significant first mover advantage"" in the electric car market, it faced mounting competition. ""As the world's most valuable car company by market capitalisation Tesla's current [share] price builds in a massive eventual market share. ""Fending off companies that have been manufacturing cars at industrial scale for years, as well as overseas start-ups, will be a big ask when the giants of the industry start to put R&D budgets to work on closing the electricity gap."" Tesla has unveiled a host of ambitious plans recently, including starting production of its own batteries, as it prepares to face increased competition from other carmakers, many of which are increasing their focus on electric offerings. It hopes to start production at its new factory in Europe, outside of Berlin, in 2021, it said.","Tesla has recorded a fifth quarter in a row of profit, as sales of its electric cars accelerated to a new record despite the pandemic."

"By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News The retail chain, which also owns Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, was hit hard when coronavirus lockdowns forced the closure of hundreds of stores. The company slashed 500 head office jobs in July, blaming lost sales. But many fashion commentators say the group's most famous brand - Topshop - has had problems for years. We take a look at what's gone wrong at the former High Street favourite. 1. It's lost its cool. Topshop's popularity peaked in the heady years before the Great Recession, when people had more money to spend and celebrities were keen to be associated with the brand. At that time, Topshop counted among its team some of the most respected names in the industry, such as stylist Katie Grand and brand director Jane Shepherdson. ""They were very good kind of fashion people with good fashion pedigree and the result of that was they had a very clear aim and they knew who their customer was,"" says fashion columnist Amber Graafland. High-profile collaborations also created buzz for the brand, as in 2007, when shoppers queued around the block to buy a piece from the range designed by Kate Moss. ""For a while Topshop was cool. They were part of London Fashion Week, they were pulling cool people onto the runway and in the front row,"" Ms Graafland says. But more recently, Topshop has failed to command that kind of status. The brand just ""isn't doing anything exciting anymore,"" says Barbara Adeniken, a London-based fashion content creator. ""When I was 18 and 19, I used to always spend my first paycheque in Topshop and buy a £90 coat. But I don't think they're seen as young and trendy anymore. More young people I know tend to shop at BooHoo and Missguided,"" she says, referring to two of the UK's most popular online retailers. Topshop didn't respond to a request for comment from BBC news. 2. Its digital business has lagged. Topshop, like other traditional High Street brands, has been challenged by online-only fashion platforms like Asos, BooHoo and Pretty Little Thing. Their low prices and rapid turnover draw in customers wanting to continually update their wardrobe - something that has become more important in the age of Instagram, says Ms Adeniken. ""There's this perception on social media that you always have to be changing your outfit so of course to do that, you buy fast fashion,"" she says. The pandemic, which forced physical stores to close for months this year, only accelerated fashion's move to the digital marketplace, says Bethan Alexander, a global retail expert at the London College of Fashion. But when it comes to selling collections online, she says Topshop's traditional high street rival Zara does a much better job. ""Topshop has been guilty of being too slow to adapt to the changing market. Whereas Zara has been investing in digital solutions in recent years - such as giving consumers online access to stock levels in-store - Topshop has been lagging behind,"" she says. 3. It's had to deal with problems at the top. Ms Alexander says Topshop's brand has also been tainted by Arcadia director Sir Philip Green, after a series of less-than-favourable incidents. First there was the BHS pension scandal, which surfaced after Sir Philip sold the now-defunct department store in 2015 to another businessman for £1. A year later BHS collapsed, 11,000 people lost their jobs and the company was found to have a pension deficit of £571m. Sir Philip later reached a deal with the Pensions Regulator - which accused him of doing the sale to dodge responsibility for the deficit - to inject £363m into the scheme. But his reputation took a hit. Then in 2018, Sir Philip was accused of sexual and racial harassment, getting named in Parliament after he took legal action to stop the media from publishing the claims. The retail boss ""categorically and wholly"" denied the allegations which The Telegraph said it had spent eight months investigating. Fast-forward to this year when the pandemic struck and shops in the UK were closed. Garment makers in Bangladesh reported that Arcadia cancelled some orders and demanded a 30% discount on others. Ms Alexander says the Topshop owner behaved ""in stark contrast with some competitors who prioritised the welfare of staff and suppliers as the pandemic hit"". 4. It scores poorly on sustainability. Topshop might not churn out new pieces at the breakneck speed of its online-only rivals, but it still has a fast fashion business model - mass producing garments cheaply, then shipping them to 260-outlets worldwide. As more consumers question firms' environmental records, Topshop has fallen behind when it comes to sustainability. ""Topshop has faced controversy over the past decade due to allegations of its social and environmental impact and a lack of any meaningful action to counteract these claims,"" says Ms Alexander. An ethical and sustainable brand aggregator, goodonyou.eco, rates Topshop as 'not good enough' when it comes to the environment and accuses it of ""not taking adequate steps to ensure payment of a living wage for its workers."" The retailer has ""zero transparency about their practices,"" says 24-year-old artist Ilona Ecott of Buckinghamshire. In contrast, she points to the ethos of newer names such as 23-year-old Grace Beverley, a social media influencer who founded an athleisure label made from a range of recycled fabrics. ""I would say there are a lot of new brands coming around that have good design and they are at least trying to give the impression of doing stuff responsibly,"" Ms Ecott says. 'I'd be gutted if it didn't stick around' For all the haters, there are undoubtedly still Topshop fans. The brand has 10 million Instagram followers, among them Ilona's friend, 22-year-old Charlotte Stock. She says you're far more likely to hold on to Topshop clothes, than those from other cheaper brands. ""People buy from Pretty Little Thing but they don't fit the same. You have them for a year then get rid of them because they're out of fashion. With Topshop you can dress a top up with different trousers or a different coat or cardigan and you can still wear them. And what if Topshop closes its doors for good? ""I'd be gutted if it didn't stick around.""",Topshop's owner Arcadia Group is reportedly in talks to secure millions of pounds in emergency funding .
"Since the beginning of December the 45 staff have been working a four-day week, but being paid the same. ""Everyone's loved it in December... because they've had a day off for buying presents,"" says boss Ffyona Dawber. The six-month trial at Synergy comes amid calls from unions for a UK-wide four-day week. In October Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the party was looking at the length of the working week ""because I think people are working too long"". 'Staff wellbeing' At Synergy Vision, operations manager and mother of two, Orla O'Brien Davison agrees: ""Time is one of the best gifts of all."" Prior to joining the company in May she had been toying with the idea of going part-time ""as it's so hard to juggle work and a young family"". ""For them to say they were going to a four-day week was great. It's made a huge difference to me."" Ms Dawber, who set up her business 11 years ago, was inspired to try out a four-day week by the results of a similar trial in New Zealand, which boosted productivity by 24%, and ""improved happiness"". She said the main reason for embarking on the experiment was ""staff well-being"" and work-life balance. However, she also hopes it will help with recruitment and retention of staff. ""We have had people working long hours and getting exhausted... and in some ways an imposed day off forces people to rest."" 'Gradual route' More broadly, of course, the push for a shorter working week is all about who benefits from automation in the workplace. The TUC used its annual conference this year to call on the government to take action to help people to work less but get paid the same. The organisation said a four-day working week would be possible if businesses were forced to share the benefits of new technology, like artificial intelligence, robotics and automation, with their workforce. And earlier this month, left-leaning think tank the New Economics Foundation (NEF) produced a briefing document examining ways of achieving a shorter working week in the UK. It's due to publish its full report and recommendations in the New Year. One option outlined in the report is to create more paid bank holidays. The economic effects would be to increase annual pay per hour worked in a year, and ensure the ""gains from increased productivity is automatically passed onto workers"". This could have the potential benefit, the report adds, of leading to ""a gradual route to a four-day week, which would be reached once every week in the year had a bank holiday"". Head of Work and Pay at NEF, Alice Martin, says a number of sectors will potentially be impacted by automation, in particular manufacturing. ""If a company is able to increase its productivity because it's automated certain tasks, profit margins go up, and rather than sacking people, it can be that work is redistributed over more employees with reduced working hours, but protecting their pay."" 'Essential way' However, Ian Brinkley, chief economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) sounds a note of caution. ""You could take all the benefits of productivity growth in higher wages or all in reduced working time, or more realistically take them as a mix between the two - that's the essential way you make this work."" He says there is no ""particularly strong evidence"" that reducing working time automatically improves productivity. ""A lot of evidence has come from companies that have cut working hours and they've said the cut in working hours makes them even more successful. ""Or was it the fact that they were successful that allowed them to cut hours in the first place? He adds: ""A four-day week is a 20% reduction in working hours. You're going to have to get a big improvement in productivity to cover that. ""It's unlikely that any productivity-enhancing effects from reducing hours would be big enough to cover the cost of reducing working hours."" Back at Synergy Vision, Ffyona Dawber thinks that at the end of the company's six-month trial the four-day working week will become permanent. ""I really do believe the long term productivity will stay the same - but time will tell - so I think the risk is low to my mind.""",Staff at medical communications agency Synergy Vision have been given the gift of time in the run-up to Christmas.
"The FTC is seeking refunds for parents who were charged. Amazon resisted a settlement offer from the FTC, and wrote in a letter to the regulator earlier this month that it would not accept tighter controls. In January, Apple settled with the FTC over similar charges. ""Amazon's in-app system allowed children to incur unlimited charges on their parents' accounts without permission,"" said FTC chair Edith Ramirez in a statement. ""Even Amazon's own employees recognized the serious problem its process created,"" she added. In response to the allegations, an Amazon spokesperson cited a letter the firm sent to the FTC on 1 July in which it wrote it was ""deeply disappointed"" by the FTC's demands. ""The [FTC]'s unwillingness to depart from the precedent it set with Apple despite our very different facts leaves us no choice but to defend our approach in court,"" wrote Amazon. 'House on fire' In its complaint, the FTC used the example of an app called ""Ice Age Village"", a game designed for children. The FTC alleged the game ""blurred the lines between what costs virtual currency and what costs real money"", with ""acorns"" and ""coins"" both serving a purpose within the game as well as being available for purchase. The largest quantity purchase available in the app would cost $99.99. In its complaint, the FTC also alleges that Amazon employees had warned in December 2011 that ""allowing unlimited in-app charges without any password was '…clearly causing problems for a large percentage of our customers,' adding that the situation was a 'near house on fire'"". In January, Apple offered refunds of up to $32.5m (£19m) to parents who had been impacted by unauthorised charges and said it would change its billing practices to prevent future unauthorised charges.","The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has sued Amazon, alleging it allowed millions of dollars of unauthorised purchases by children in its mobile app store."
"By Russell HottenBBC News, Dubai Air Show The president of Emirates, the biggest long-haul airline in the world, was no climate change denier. But he was pretty sceptical about some of the claims. Not now, though. ""The stark reality of climate change is with us. I'm a climate change believer. I have to say, it took me a long time to get there. ""And we [in the aviation industry] aren't doing ourselves any favours by chucking billions of tons of carbon into the air. It's got to be dealt with,"" he told the BBC. It's a frank admission from one of the most powerful people in an industry that has many commercial reasons to bury its head in the sand. Another surprise is his admiration for climate change activists. ""I quite like Extinction Rebellion and Greta Thunberg for having brought a real focus to the issue; a focus on the fact that we are not doing enough at the speed we should be. ""I'm not condoning some of their methods. But Extinction Rebellion and Greta have a role to play... We really need this kind of thing to force us to make decisions."" Activists have done more to highlight the issues than any government or industry body ever has, he says. Sir Tim, 70 later this month, has spent half his working life helping to establish and then run the Dubai-based carrier. Emirates is now one of the world's most successful airlines, carrying 150,000 people a day. So, tackling the airline's carbon footprint is not the first challenge he's faced. But it's up there with the biggest. Emirates, which also includes a big cargo operation, burns through an astonishing 100 million barrels of oil each year. So finding a viable alternative to fossil fuels is not going to happen any time soon, Sir Tim says. He has little faith that electric battery alternatives will ever be capable of powering a big airliner. And while biofuels are an option, they won't be scalable to meet demand. Sir Tim thinks synthetic fuels offer the best alternative, but these are years from being fit for purpose. Nevertheless, meaningful change is happening, Sir Tim insists. ""But the industry has been a very bad articulator of the good things we've done."" Aero-engines are far more efficient - 50% more efficient than 30 years ago, he says. Use of lighter materials in manufacturing airframes means a lighter fuel burn. Airlines are stripping out plastic use where they can - ""more difficult than you'd imagine""- and changing the way aircraft taxi on runways. It would also help if governments improved airspace use. ""Aircraft don't fly in a straight line. Even in Europe we have to make too many dog-legs,"" he said. There are plenty of other small changes - what he calls ""low hanging fruit"" - that cumulatively could make a big dent in the industry's carbon footprint. ""We are trying every trick in the book to improve things,"" he said. Except, emissions are forecast to rise over the next couple of years as air travel in the Middle East and Asia continues to grow. And Emirates is expanding its fleet to meet that growth. Sir Tim spoke to the BBC at the Dubai Air Show, where the airline has announced another blockbuster $16bn order for aircraft. He understands that most activists and ""flight shamers"" won't be happy until aircraft stop flying. But it's not practical and, frankly, it's just not going to happen, he said. Sir Tim also wonders if people in Europe and the US should be denying newly-affluent travellers elsewhere the same benefits the West had. While he accepts there will be no meeting of minds with those on the other side of the table, he would like activists to at least know they have helped push through change. ""We are no longer dragging our feet,"" he said.",It took Sir Tim Clark a long time to face up to the climate crisis.
"By Kitti PalmaiBusiness reporter Grace Smith says she was able to give up alcohol, but that quitting smoking seemed impossible. Back in 2011, the then 25-year-old had a stressful fundraising job in New York. ""I didn't have any healthy coping mechanisms,"" she says. ""One of the ways that I was coping with all the stress and anxiety was through partying. ""I was living in the Lower East Side, and that's what all my friends did too - we worked really hard all day long, and we partied really hard all night. It took a real toll on me, physically and mentally."" Grace realised that she had to get healthy, so she quit partying, and sobered up. But she just couldn't shake her heavy smoking, despite trying gum and patches, and the dreaded ""cold turkey"". Eventually a friend suggested she tried hypnosis. ""I was very sceptical,"" says Grace. ""I didn't know if it was going to be swinging watches... or simply a hoax."" She says that she was able to quit nicotine after just the one session. And the experience inspired her to become a hypnotherapist herself. Today Grace runs her business Grace Space Hypnosis, which is said to offer online hypnotherapy sessions to more than 250,000 people around the world, including the bosses of Fortune 500 companies, athletes and celebrities. The 34-year-old is also a regular on US television, and the author of two hypnosis books. But what exactly is hypnotherapy? The Oxford English Dictionary defines hypnotism as ""artificially producing a state in which the subject appears to be in a deep sleep, without any power of changing his mental or physical condition, except under the influence of some external suggestion or direction, to which he is involuntarily and unconsciously obedient"". Grace calls it far more simply, ""meditation with a goal"". Her clients use it to try to accomplish everything from losing weight, to quitting a habit, de-stressing, or achieving an ambition. While some people still consider hypnotherapy to be a controversial practice, its use is supported by a great many medical organisations. For example, Cancer Research UK says that ""some people with cancer use hypnotherapy to help them relax and cope with symptoms and treatment"". Born and raised in New Jersey, Grace gained a combined degree in English, business management and religious studies from Wagner College in New York. She then enrolled on a masters in human rights studies at Columbia University. To become a hypnotherapist back in 2011, she completed a 250-hour certification course while still working full time. This was the training required in the US, although it varies greatly from country to country. After Grace finished the course she quit her fundraising job, and set herself up as a professional hypnotherapist from a ""tiny"" office in New York. To attract her first clients she advertised an initial special offer price on online marketplace LivingSocial, which is today part of Groupon. She says she managed to sell 952 sessions in 24 hours, and more people then came thanks to positive word of mouth. The initial sessions were face-to-face, but Grace then moved her business online, with sessions taking place over video link. She says the idea for this came from her corporate clients, who wanted to keep up their sessions while away on business. Two years in her Brazilian husband, Bernardo Feitosa, joined the business to look after the technology side of things. In recent years interest in Grace and her now Florida-based business has grown strongly, thanks in no small part to her presence on US TV. She has appeared on CBS's daytime health chat show The Doctors, and Sony's The Dr Oz Show. Jodi Clarke, founder of Australian hypnotherapy business Awaecnan, says that Grace has worked ""tirelessly to make hypnosis mainstream"". Meanwhile, Jamie Hacker Hughes, a UK clinical psychologist, says that Grace and other such hypnotherapists ""can be very effective in helping patients to manage a wide range of presentations"", when used ""as an adjunct to therapy used in psychology, medicine and dentistry"". To help train and certify more hypnotherapists, in 2016 Grace opened her own school, which is approved by both the International Association of Counselors and Therapists, and the International Hypnosis Federation. More The Boss features: The Grace Space Hypnotherapy School has now trained more than 200 people. Combined with Grace's main company, which has 20 contractors, she is expecting annual revenues of $3m (£2.4m) this year. During the Covid-19 pandemic it offered free sessions to frontline medical staff worldwide. Looking ahead, Grace says she wants to help continue to make hypnotherapy become more widely accepted. ""It is still widely misunderstood,"" she says, unhappy that some people still think of it as ""mind control... which couldn't be further from the truth"". ""When you know what a positive impact you're making in the world... to have someone belittle your work in such a flippant way is painful and frustrating,"" says the mother of two.",The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to US hypnotist Grace Smith.
"By Matthew WallTechnology of Business editor TalkTalk joins a lengthening global list of companies that have suffered major data breaches, including Ashley Madison, eBay, AOL, Target, Home Depot, Sony, Anthem and JPMorgan Chase. Google and McAfee estimate there are 2,000 cyber-attacks every day around the world, costing the global economy about £300bn ($460bn) a year. Yet more than two thirds of firms say they feel inadequately protected against increasingly sophisticated hackers looking to extort money through blackmail or steal data to sell on the black market. So what should businesses be doing to improve their security? Technology of Business canvassed cybersecurity experts for their views. 1. Protect your data, not just the perimeter Our ideas about corporate cybersecurity are out-of-date, many experts warn. Concentrating on shoring up the castle walls is not enough, yet 87% of security budgets is still spent on firewall technology, says Tim Grieveson, chief cyber strategist at Hewlett-Packard. Forget the gate and drawbridge idea, there are now hundreds of potential entrances to the castle because businesses are connected to customers, suppliers, and employees over the internet. Not only that, but it's as if everyone who comes in and out of the castle has a key to unlock all the doors as well. Breaches are inevitable, comes the stark warning, so protect the data that matters. ""The bottom line is, CIOs [chief information officers] need to accept their company will be breached and shift their security strategy from 'breach prevention' to 'breach acceptance',"" says Jason Hart, chief technology officer at digital security specialist, Gemalto. Tom Patterson, general manager of global security solutions for IT services firm Unisys, calls this new approach micro-segmentation - building lots of little walls around those parts of your business containing data you can't afford to lose. This involves cryptographically signing each bit of digital information - the packet data - with a code unique to each segment of the business. So if hackers break in, all they get access to is the data specific to that community or segment. ""A small breach is easier to manage - they may steal a little bit, or disrupt a little bit, but they don't take down the whole corporation,"" says Mr Patterson. The challenge, says Mr Grieveson, is ""knowing what data to prioritise."" 2. Know your data But many businesses don't even know what data they have stored on their systems, let alone how important it is, such is the complexity of their legacy computer systems and the recent proliferation of digital data from mobile and ""internet of things"" devices. According to a recent survey by information management firm Veritas, 59% of the data in UK IT systems is unclassified ""dark data"". Yet knowing what you have is key to any security strategy, says Mr Grieveson. ""Businesses need to understand the risk of different types of data being lost."" Once you've done this you can then employ ""best practice data protection - attaching security directly to the data itself, using multi-factor authentication and data encryption, as well as securely managing encryption keys,"" says Mr Hart. ""That way, if the data is stolen, it is useless to the thieves."" 3. Wake up to the insider threat It's all too easy to concentrate on the attacks coming from outside and ignore the risks posed - wittingly or unwittingly - by people inside your organisation. And insider attacks can also be more difficult to detect and deal with. ""In reality it takes about 70 days to remediate an insider cyber-attack,"" says Mr Grieveson. Employees clicking on email attachments they believe are from trusted sources is ""the number one threat for organisations"", says Gary Steele, boss of Proofpoint, a secure email specialist. ""A company can spend millions on investments in security solutions, but all it takes is one click on one link by one employee, and the company is compromised,"" he says. Hackers are becoming very clever at using personal information gleaned from social media and other sources - so-called social engineering - to convince employees that emails are from people they know. Educating staff about this threat should be a priority, experts advise. When it comes to employees in the pay of criminal gangs, predictive analytics tools can try to spot anomalies in their behaviour on a corporate network, but such tools can be expensive and time-consuming to manage. 4. Increase vigilance Companies can achieve a lot simply by monitoring their systems more effectively, says Gavin Millard, technical director at Tenable Network Security. This includes the ""patching of easily exploitable bugs, robust filtering of inbound and outbound communications, up-to-date malware defence, encryption of sensitive information, and a good password policy,"" he summarises. At the very least, firms should make sure network security certificates and antivirus and firewall software is up-to-date. ""Investing in monitoring controls to detect when an attack occurs is probably of most importance from a technology perspective,"" says AlienVault's Javvad Malik. ""From a non-technology perspective, security training for staff can go a long way."" 5. Get to grips with mobile If staff use their own mobile devices for work purposes, firms should at the least restrict access to critical data and systems, the IT professionals say. At best, firms should switch to a centrally-controlled system giving IT departments the ability to wipe devices remotely if they are lost or stolen. ""Organisations need to embrace a zero-trust philosophy,"" says Jason Garbis of security company, Cryptzone. 6. Spend more money and time on cybersecurity Cybersecurity firms with products and services to sell would say this, wouldn't they? But even TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding admitted that she would be ""spending more money and more time on cybersecurity because it is the number one risk"". Big companies with sensitive consumer data to protect are increasingly appointing chief security officers, often to board level positions, in an acknowledgement that cybersecurity has to be built in to all business processes. Cybersecurity is everyone's problem, not just the responsibility of IT departments. Follow Matthew on Twitter here: @matthew_wall",Last week's cyber-attack on UK telecoms provider TalkTalk has once again highlighted the critical importance of cybersecurity.
"Simon JackBusiness editor Inflation has been on a steady climb since the end of 2015 and accelerated after the EU referendum result in June last year, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound pushed up the price of everything we import. A bit like a snake that has swallowed something big, that bulge in import costs has taken its time to work through the economic system because producers, wholesalers and retailers order things in advance, so it takes time for higher costs to show up in consumer prices. It is tempting to think that the bulge has finally got through the system and inflation will now begin to fall. There is some evidence to support that in the details of Tuesday's report. The rate of inflation in the price of materials on their way into the factory has fallen from a whopping 11.6% in May to 8.8%. The price of goods leaving the factory is also rising less quickly, down from 3.6% to 3.3%. The widest point of the bulge, it seems, has passed through the manufacturing bit of the snake. That still leaves some inflationary pressure heading for consumers but that has been partially offset by falling oil prices. To be clear, inflation could still go up again this year - and many economists forecast it will - but it seems likely that we have been at least close to the peak. What does all this mean for interest rates? At 2.6%, inflation is still above the Bank of England's target of 2% and at the last rate-setting meeting, three out of eight committee members voted for a rise. Of the three would-be raisers, one has left the committee and the five who voted to hold will feel vindicated now in their wait and see approach. Remember that prices are still rising faster than the 2% at which wages are increasing. The squeeze is even tighter if you work in the public sector where wage rises are controversially capped at 1%. Raising interest rates against the backdrop of falling real incomes would further erode consumer spending power and that is bad news for an economy that relies on consumer spending for three-quarters of its growth. The income squeeze is still very much alive, the chance of an imminent rise in interest rates looks dead.","The surprise fall in the inflation rate from 2.9% to 2.6% begs the question: has it now peaked? And if so, what does that mean for living standards and borrowing costs?"
"By Nell MackenzieBusiness reporter, BBC News When Covid-19 closed the ballroom dance studio where Madis Abel and Aleksandra Galkina practised, it was their first break in eight years. Mr Abel could finally recover from the hip injury he had sustained months earlier. ""Usually, I just have to keep going and going,"" says the Estonian. He and his Russian partner are highly ranked in the world of international standard ballroom dancing. This includes the waltz, tango, foxtrot, Viennese waltz and quickstep categories. In a normal year, their 12-hour weekdays at their base in the Estonian capital of Tallinn would see them first practise for three hours, and then spend the rest of their time teaching other dancers. On weekends they would travel to competitions across Europe and around the world. When lockdowns darkened dance floors back in the spring, the couple separated temporarily, and Ms Galkina flew home to Russia. But Mr Abel says they definitely were not ""just chilling"". Instead they moved their lessons online, teaching students via video calls. And after his hip recovered, both logged many hours in the gym. ""I like to kill my body with exercise,"" he says. Last month they attended a local competition in Estonia, their first since February. ""It felt so good to be back,"" says Ms Galkina. ""Without the competitive life, it's not the same."" New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. New York-based Edward Simon is a former American smooth champion - which shares the same dances as traditional ballroom, but also allows additional spins and jazz moves. Before the arrival of Covid-19 he judged and coached at competitions around the world, and the bulk of his revenues came from coaching and choreography sessions people would schedule with him at these events. High-level coaches like Mr Simon can earn as much as £400,000 a year. This is more than top professional dancers, who earn in excess of £100,000. When Mr Simon's travelling schedule was cancelled, he pivoted his attention to develop a business that he co-owns, Dance Teachers Network, online. This offers classes to both dancers and instructors. ""My job right now is to help these teachers on their path,"" says Mr Simon. ""It's the most important thing I need to do for the industry right now."" He says that he has turned a growing number of instructors on to Zoom, and that it has been transformative for many. One particularly reluctant instructor is said to have won back 70% of his students. Mr Simon adds that another teacher told him how, during a lesson, when he reached up to adjust his video camera with two hands, his student said, ""Oh you are giving me a hug, that means so much to me right now."" However, unlike his face-to-face lessons, Mr Simon is currently still offering his online sessions for free. Two other ballroom dancing coaches who have moved online since the start of the pandemic are Slawek Sochacki and Marzena Stachura. Yet even before this, the impact of Covid-19 meant they had to relocate to the other side of the world. The four-time, undefeated American smooth champions had to go back to their native Poland, temporarily, after 18 years in the US. This was after the landlord of their dance studio near Los Angeles demanded they continue paying the $9,000 (£7,000) monthly rent, even when they were required to close. Ms Stachura says they found a welcome, paying client base in Poland. ""People said, 'Wait a minute, we were already asking you guys to come back like three years ago, to come teach us.'"" The dance partners charge $130 for a one-on-one 45-minute online session, dropping to $20 per person for group calls. Back in the US, New York-based coach Tatiana Keegan has started to offer daily Latin dancing exercise classes via live streams on Facebook. The lessons are free, but participants can choose to make a donation. Ms Keegan, who is also the current US Latin dance champion for couples over 35, adds: ""I wanted to give a sense of belonging... and to make my students understand they can stay in dancing shape from their living room."" She has now taught more than 90 hour-long online classes, gaining students from countries such as Turkey, India, Spain and Italy. The lessons are for her too, she says, as they keep her in shape for her own competitive dancing. ""I'm gonna keep going,"" she says. ""If I don't dance, I'll die."" Also in the US, Michelle Hudson took her annual dance competition, Heart of America Dancesport Championships, online. This year's event, in August, saw more than 2,000 entries. Entry for professionals was free and for amateurs there was a $75 registration fee, plus $25-$65 for dancing fees. Instead of travelling to the usual host city of Kansas City, Missouri, entrants slapped on sequins and make-up, and either went to their local dance studio or set up makeshift ballrooms at home. One couple even performed in a park, and some younger dancers who normally would not have been able to afford to travel to the event, were able to compete remotely against more established pairs. And because the event was live streamed for free, the competition reached a new audience. ""I had dancers tell me that their parents had never seen them dance before,"" says Ms Hudson. ""And some of their family members are elderly and have been quarantined. They haven't seen them in months, but they got to watch them dance."" For professional dancers who have seen competitions suspended, Mr Simon thinks this pause could actually ultimately be to their benefit. ""As a coach, sometimes it's hard to say, 'Take a breath,'"" he says. ""Let's really focus on something rather than do, do, do. ""How do you change something? How do you get to the next level? And that's hard to do in regular time. So this time period allows that to happen."" Back in Estonia, Mr Abel and Ms Galkina say they will keep practising ahead of the world returning to normal. ""We will keep improving, and trying to get something new into our dancing, so that when we finally get out of this lockdown we can absolutely blow everyone off their feet,"" says Mr Abel.","With the first Strictly Come Dancing live show on UK screens later, Nell Mackenzie looks at how professional ballroom dancers and coaches around the world are continuing to cope with the impact of pandemic restrictions."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter A total of £8.7bn was spent on credit cards in the first full month of lockdown in April, half the level of April last year, UK Finance said. The banking trade body said this was the lowest level of spending seen since the last economic downturn. The cancellation of holiday plans is one likely reason for the fall. Safety-first Consumers often use credit cards to pay for summer getaways or major purchases such as household appliances, owing to the extra protection available if something goes wrong. Many people uncertain about the coronavirus effect on their jobs and finances would have put off buying these items, UK Finance said. The temporary closure of shops and travel restrictions would also have meant many people put these buying decisions on hold. Some pre-paid holidays or flights were refunded into credit card accounts after being cancelled, and consumers adopted a safety-first approach to their credit card spending similar to that seen following the banking crisis of a decade ago. As a result, outstanding balances on credit cards fell by almost £4.7bn in April 2020, the largest monthly fall in over a decade, as many people opted to make repayments rather than spend on their credit cards, UK Finance said. Separate data from the Bank of England has also shown this repayment trend. Eric Leenders, from UK Finance, said: ""The Covid-19 crisis has significantly changed how, where and when people spend their money."" Online switch With many shops closed in April, the proportion of card spending that was completed online hit a record level. A third of credit and debit card spending was made over the internet, according to the UK Finance figures. The picture for debit cards is more complex. With shops closed, the use of these cards was down 5.1% in April compared with the same month a year ago. Contactless payments saw a significant drop, as many people were working from home and making fewer occasional purchases, as well as commuting less. However, with the limit on contactless payments having risen from £30 to £45 and some shops refusing cash, the average purchase using this technology rose above £10 for the first time.",Credit cards spending dropped by nearly half at the start of lockdown as people played safe with their finances and shunned big purchases.
"Travellers to the UK spent £2.75bn on their visits, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, another record. The figures also show the number of visits abroad by UK residents fell 2% from July last year to 6.9 million, with spending also down 2% to £4.5bn. The weakening of the pound since the Brexit vote has made prices in the UK cheaper for travellers from abroad. However, Patricia Yates, from tourist promotion agency VisitBritain, said the pound was a only small part of the story: ""We know the weak pound helps, but it is not the motivator for first time visitors - most people overseas do not know what the exchange rate is."" So far this year, the number of overseas visits to the UK are up 8% on the same period last year, with spending running at £13.3bn. The ONS says tourism is worth £127bn annually to the UK economy. Here is a breakdown of where tourists to the UK come from: Ms Yates said an improvement in airline capacity, particularly between the UK and China and the UK and North America had helped to encourage visitors. ""The US has been sluggish for a while - so some of it is bounce back, but some of it is because of the more competitive nature of transatlantic traffic,"" she said. ""We have also been building a buzz with [online travel website] Expedia, trying to encourage interest in places they may not have considered before."" Tourism Minister John Glen said: ""Tourism is a major economic force that creates jobs and drives growth for the whole of the country. ""These record figures show the continued strength of this important sector and the UK's global position as a must-visit destination."" Top five visitor attractions in UK and annual visit numbers:","The number of overseas visitors to the UK topped four million in July for the first time, official figures show."
"By Anthony ReubenHead of statistics, BBC News Take these comments as an example, from 23 October 2009. ""Do today's data tell us anything about what is really going on in the economy? Probably not. ""In the past, the ONS's early GDP estimates have contained no statistically useful information about growth."" Did these views, quoted in a blog by Stephanie Flanders, the BBC's former economics editor, come from some extreme outlier in the economic world? No, they came from Ben Broadbent, who was an economist at Goldman Sachs at the time and who is now deputy governor of the Bank of England and a member of its interest rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee. GDP is a measure of all of the goods and services produced by an economy over a particular period, usually three months. His comments were based on research by his colleague Kevin Daly, who is still at Goldman Sachs and is not a fan of the figures. ""We didn't believe the data in 2009,"" he says. The economy was recovering much more slowly than other economies, but other indicators didn't agree. In particular, the employment data was difficult to reconcile with other data."" Mr Daly says there is much less debate about the period now, and that ONS reviews have agreed with his analysis. ONS chief economist Joe Grice sees things a bit differently. ""In the second half of 2009, lots of commentators were saying that the economy was growing fast, but it's clear now that it wasn't,"" he says. He adds that it's a good thing the Bank of England did not believe the people who said there was a lot of growth, because then it might have raised interest rates and ""we would have been in terrible trouble by now"". How GDP became the figure to watch Quick figures There is no question that there are uncertainties surrounding the first estimate of UK growth measured by gross domestic product (GDP), as Joe Grice explained last year. The first figures come less than a month after the end of the period they're measuring, which is pretty swift by international standards. At that point only about 44% of the returns from businesses have been received. ""Only the US does it so early - the rest of Europe does it 15 days later,"" says James Mitchell, professor of economic modelling at Warwick Business School. ""Revisions are inevitable because we put pressure on the ONS to produce estimates so early."" GDP estimates are indeed constantly being revised, most formally one month and two months later, but they never stop being revised, mainly because of changes to the methodology. When there are big changes to the methodology, like the ones due later this year that will change the treatment of spending on research and development for example, the changes have to be backdated, so there are likely to be revisions to some pretty old figures. So, with how much of a pinch of salt should the preliminary estimate be taken? Joe Grice says plus or minus 0.2 percentage points would be fair. What that means, as with most economic data, is that what is important is the trend rather than the precise figure. This was a particular problem in 2011 and 2012 when there were several quarters of growth or contraction of 0.2% or less. You may remember the double-dip recession that disappeared after the figure for the first quarter of 2012 was revised. 'Difficult task' It's important to bear in mind just how difficult it is to measure GDP for an advanced economy. Jonathan Haskel, professor of economics at Imperial College Business School, explains part of the problem with the example of an economy producing steel and cars. You can't just count all the sales by the steel company and the car companies because some of the steel has gone into the cars, so you need to avoid counting it twice. Instead you have to count the value added at each stage of the process. ""In the face of a difficult task the ONS is probably doing the best it can,"" says Prof Haskel. ""It's probably not doing it any worse than anyone else."" And the task is being made more difficult. ""The economy is changing in ways not captured well by the statistics,"" says Diane Coyle, author of GDP: A brief but affectionate history. She cites the increasing numbers of small firms and the importance of things like software and trademarks. ""We need to take the quarterly figures more cautiously than we do,"" she says. She adds that the ONS is better than most at calculating the figures. Respected economist and former Bank of England committee member Kate Barker will soon publish her review of the quality of ONS figures, so we will soon get another assessment of their quality. It should be said that the ONS is generally judged to have captured the sharp declines in GDP as a result of the financial crisis pretty well, which improved many commentators' views of its methodology. Also, few would argue against the idea that bodies such as the MPC need to use official figures from the ONS alongside things like business surveys, which may give more immediate ideas of the state of the economy as well as hinting at what may happen in the future. Indeed, the Bank of England is unusual in producing its own indicator called the GDP backcast, which combines the ONS figures with other factors. Nonetheless, its official position is that the Monetary Policy Committee puts considerable weight on the ONS data and understands that it needs revising for honourable reasons from time to time. And Ben Broadbent hasn't objected to that so far.",Every now and then you hear criticism of the official economic growth figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
"Unite will start balloting more than 2,000 drivers who work for seven major fuel distribution firms next week. It warned that supermarkets, garages and airports could all be affected. The government said it was aware of the union's ballot plans and urged it ""to resolve the issues it raises directly with the employers concerned"". Unite wants to see a forum established to agree industry-wide best practice on safety, training and terms and conditions. It said the ballot would cover about 90% of drivers supplying petrol to UK forecourts. ""This is not about pay - this is about ensuring that high safety and training standards are maintained so that our communities are safe,"" said Matt Draper, Unite national officer. Over the next two days the union will serve notice of the ballot on Wincanton, DHL, Hoyer, BP, JW Suckling, Norbert Dentressangle and Turners. A spokeswoman at Wincanton said the company had been recognised by the Energy Institute in November as being a leader in terms of health and safety.","Thousands of tanker drivers across the UK are to be balloted for strike action in a row over safety and working practices, the Unite union has said."
"The measure, to help social distancing on trains, will mean passengers with flexible tickets will have to pick a service to travel on, in advance. The company operates services between London and Leeds, and Edinburgh, York, Newcastle and London, Separately, Avanti West Coast is urging customers to reserve tickets, but has not made it compulsory. However, it says passengers may not be allowed to get on a train if they do not have a reservation. Avanti, which runs services linking London, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham, is also encouraging people to wear face coverings when they travel. Chiltern Railways is also advising its passengers to book tickets in advance where possible and to wear masks. Passenger tips LNER confirmed its shift to mandatory reservations in a tweet. This contained ""tips"" for passengers, travelling on its trains, including: The company concluded by asking: ""Can you travel another way? Help us keep the trains clear for those who really need them."" LNER said passengers would have to make a seat reservation if they have a flexible ticket that does not have a reservation, or if they are a season ticket holder. Customers will not be charged for making a reservation. Existing seat reservations are still valid, but will no longer be linked to a specific seat number. LNER said it was asking passengers to choose their own seat on board the train. A spokesperson said: ""The safety of our staff and customers is always our top priority. To support social distancing for customers who do need to travel with us at this time, all LNER services will be reservation only from Monday 18 May 2020. ""We will have full details updated on our website over the weekend. LNER services continue to operate for those who have no alternative travel options."" Avanti's new measures also take effect on Monday and the company said it may not allow carriages to be more than a quarter full. ""We're appealing to our valued customers to help us and other passengers by only travelling with a reservation,"" said Avanti West Coast's managing director Phil Whittingham. ""If everyone does this, we'll be able to keep social distancing in place on board, both for our customers and our people. ""If customers do turn up without a reservation, we'll do our best to help but we can't guarantee they'll be able to take the train they want."" The train operator is asking passengers to book in advance on the Avanti mobile app where possible, and to avoid using facilities at the station or handling cash. People should also check before they travel, in case the time of their train has changed. Other measures being introduced by Avanti include face masks for staff, while waiting rooms and lounges will be shut. There will also be enhanced cleaning procedures on board trains and at stations, focusing especially on cleaning door buttons, grab handles, tables and all touch points, as well as equipment such as phones, chip and pin machines, self-service ticket machines and point of sale systems. Shops on board Voyager services, which travel between London and destinations such as Blackpool, Shrewsbury, Birmingham, Edinburgh and North Wales, will be closed and no food and drink will be available. The shops on Pendolino services will still be open, but re-usable coffee cups will not be accepted. Increased train services Avanti said a new timetable was being brought in from Monday, in line with updated travel advice from the government that will see train services increase to about 70% of the normal timetable. During the coronavirus pandemic only half of normal rail services have been running. Chiltern Railways also revealed a new timetable, which comes into force on 18 May, and has advised its passengers to book tickets in advance where possible and to wear masks. The company - whose trains from London Marylebone travel on routes to Aylesbury, Oxford, Stratford-upon-Avon and Kidderminster - also told travellers to avoid rush hour and allow more time for their journey. Meanwhile, bus operator National Express says it has begun selling coach tickets for a restart to services on 1 July, subject to government advice. The easing of travel restrictions is likely to be done gradually - the government has suggested that working hours might be staggered to limit passenger numbers. People in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible. If maintained, the two-metre social distancing measure would cut capacity on trains by up to 90%. A recent Transport Focus survey suggested more than 60% of UK passengers would not feel comfortable using public transport unless social distancing was in place. It found 51% would not be happy unless passengers were required to wear masks.",East Coast train operator LNER is to introduce mandatory seat reservations on all train services from Monday.
"Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, were up by 3.3% for the three months to October, the biggest rise since November 2008. Average weekly wages are £495 - the highest since 2011, when adjusted for inflation. The number of people in work rose by 79,000 to 32.48 million, a record high. That is the highest figure since records began in 1971. Unemployment increased by 20,000 to 1.38 million, although the margin of error is 70,000 and the total is still lower than a year ago. The number of unemployed men increased by 27,000, while the number of unemployed women fell by 8,000. The reason both employment and unemployment have increased is a result of the UK's rising population and more people joining the labour force, such as students and older people. Job vacancies were up by 10,000 on the quarter to a record high of 848,000. More than half, 195,000, of the 329,000 jobs created in the year to October went to people who are no longer economically inactive, who are the main reason for the expansion in the workforce There are fewer students, people who are not working because of caring responsibilities, long-term sick and retired people in the 16 to 64 age group than a year ago. ""Real earnings are now growing faster than at any time since around the end of 2016,"" said the ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Today's statistics show the enduring strength of our jobs market, with wages outpacing inflation for the ninth month in a row and employment at a record high."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The reality behind these figures is that the number of people in work in poverty is rising faster than employment. Real wages are still lower than they were 10 years ago."" Fears that the labour market is tightening were expressed by the CBI's Matthew Percival and Suren Thiru, of the British Chambers of Commerce, Mr Percival said this was shown by ""a record employment rate and a rising number of jobs that can't be filled"". He added: ""While pay growth is improving at its fastest and most sustained rate in a decade, this is still slower than the UK has achieved in the past."" Mr Thiru blamed ""the second successive rise in unemployment, coupled with a decline in the number of people who are not seeking work"" for the labour market's contraction. ""Businesses report that the political and economic turbulence, together with significant difficulties finding the right staff, are diminishing recruitment intentions, which is likely to increasingly weigh on the UK labour market over the near term,"" he added. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The rise in pay growth is little consolation for workers in the middle of the longest pay squeeze in 200 years, with real wages expected only to get back to pre-crisis level in 2024. We need a plan that supports jobs and wages."" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Current decent employment may be influenced by companies being keen to employ while they can, given the increased concern in some sectors over a lack of suitably skilled candidates. ""In some cases this has been significantly influenced by fewer workers coming from the EU,"" he said. In a note, analysts Capital Economics said: ""The latest labour market figures suggest that a recovery in real pay growth is taking root. This supports our view that GDP growth will rebound next year if a 'no-deal' Brexit is avoided. ""Admittedly, there have been false dawns in the past few years. But we think that the recent recovery in real earnings growth will probably be sustained."" Stephen Clarke, of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""While Brexit uncertainty and political paralysis are having a cooling effect on the wider economy, the labour market is proving more resilient."" He added that pay should improve in 2019, but warned: ""After a pretty appalling decade, Britain remains some way off a return to the levels of real pay we enjoyed before the crash.""","Wages are continuing to rise at their highest level for nearly a decade, the latest official Office for National Statistics figures show."
"By Jonathan KeaneTechnology reporter Release dates for films and TV shows are usually delayed in Australia and neighbouring New Zealand. This has continued with digital content lagging behind, especially when it comes to streaming services like Netflix, while prices for digital content are much higher. ""Companies are charging more because they think they can,"" says Erin Turner, campaigns manager at Australian consumer rights group Choice. ""There's no higher delivery cost. It's not like you have to ship digital content to Australia."" This has become known as the ""Australia Tax"", which was detailed in a report from Choice, showing that Aussies pay much more than others, while a second report showed that consumers still access US- or UK-based streaming services via means such as VPNs. ""Well over 300,000 households already are on the US Netflix,"" explains Ms Turner. In November Netflix announced it would finally be launching in Australia and New Zealand in March, but online piracy remains a significant issue for the government and ISPs. Piracy concerns Piracy is not a problem unique to down under, but it has led to particularly strong pressure from rights holders on ISPs to deal with pirates and even on Netflix to block the use of VPNs. To clarify the point, the use of VPNs is legal but for many rights holders it can be a pain when customers jump over geo-restrictions as the content is not licensed to that particular country. While VPN use is bothersome to the studios, it remains a legitimate method of accessing content. However at the same time, piracy and accessing content illegally is even more common. It serves as a reminder that Australians will use whatever method they can to access the content they want, even if that means pirating. This has forced the Australian government's hand into setting an April deadline for ISPs and rights holders to set a code relating to piracy, which may include requests to block certain piracy sites. If no arrangement can be made, the government will set one itself under the Telecommunications Act or the Copyright Act, says minister for communications Malcolm Turnbull, but he insists that any blocking is ""not an internet filter"". ""What we have got to make sure is the measures we employ are the most efficient, impose the least cost on the industry and consumers, and obviously are carefully monitored to make sure that they are effective,"" says Mr Turnbull. A number of ISPs say they are willing to work with rights holders on the best possible code, but the shape it will take remains unclear. ""We stand ready to work with rights holders and other ISPs to implement these measures quickly, efficiently and with minimal impact on our customers,"" says Jane van Beelen, executive director of regulatory affairs at Telstra, though it is unknown how the costs will affect ISPs. Australia's Optus, which operates Virgin Mobile, says it, too, is welcoming the arrival of more services down under but could not comment on the piracy code talks. ""About 33% of Australians illegally download content, and when we asked them about the reasons behind this, the main motivators were access, affordability and timeliness,"" says Ms Turner. ""Most people accept that it is reasonable to pay,"" adds Mr Turnbull. ""Their incentive to steal stuff is obviously increased by a. the cost of buying content legitimately and b. and I think this is just as big an issue, the convenience or lack of convenience of buying stuff legitimately."" Would the long awaited arrival of Netflix in Australia stem piracy, or at least contribute in some way if it creates timeliness and convenience? ""In terms of it stemming national issues, either access or affordability, it really depends on what's on the service,"" says Ms Turner. When contacted for comment in late December, Netflix said it still has not set a price for its Australian and New Zealand services or what content will be available beyond what was mentioned in the press release. There are home-grown options for customers too, such as Telstra's BigPond Movies, which saw five million downloads between December 2013 and December 2014, but its offering is small pickings compared to that of the US Netflix and the demand for the bigger players remains high. Trying to keep up In a bid to meet demand, some ISPs have taken a little more initiative. In neighbouring New Zealand, Slingshot launched Global Mode, which allows users to access typically geo-restricted content. ""Global Mode is designed to make it easy for Kiwis to bypass geo-blocking, and access content that is available in countries like the US and UK,"" says Taryn Hamilton, general manager of Slingshot, who says the feature has been very successful. This is despite a number of New Zealand TV stations refusing to air ads for the service, believing it essentially amounts to piracy. ""We hope that in the long term Global Mode will become redundant, but that won't happen until Kiwis can access content on the same terms as those overseas can."" Slingshot is similar in some ways to VPN services, which mask the user's IP address and connect to a server in a different country. One of the major selling points for VPNs is privacy, which is why a number of services, like TunnelBear, will not confirm how many Australian and NZ users it has, but say that numbers are growing. ""For privacy reasons, we don't track where our users are connecting from,"" says Ryan Dochuk, co-founder of TunnelBear. ""However, I can tell you we've seen tremendous growth globally over the past couple years, with over four million users in 179 countries. ""We also think location privacy is best for consumers, as well as competition among content providers on the internet."" Mr Hamilton says Global Mode, which is primarily used to access Netflix, will continue to be available after the official New Zealand launch as it can still be used to access other sites, which have content unavailable to Kiwis. ""It's old school thinking to launch content piecemeal around the world,"" he says, ""especially when you have territories champing at the bit to get your service, and when there is an easy alternative in pirating content."" The playing field may begin to level out for content accessibility down under, but there are still many obstacles for ISPs, rights holders, and governments to address in the coming year.",Australians love content and they'll do whatever it takes to find it - and that often means illegally downloading or streaming.
"The streaming giant added more than 10 million subscribers in the three months to July, bringing the total of new subscribers to 26 million in 2020. In contrast, Netflix saw 28 million new subscribers for the whole of 2019. ""Growth is slowing as consumers get through the initial shock of coronavirus and social restrictions."" Netflix shares dropped in after-hours trading as investors digested the firm's quarterly update. The streaming service's revenue increased almost 25% to $6.1bn (£4.9bn), while profits rose to $720m in the quarter, up from $271m a year go. The subscriber additions were far higher than analysts had expected. While, some people might still end up quitting the service, ""the pandemic has clearly shown that Netflix is an indispensable part of viewers lives,"" said Paolo Pescatore, analyst at PP Foresight. Sophie Lund Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the streaming service will have to continue to spend heavily on new shows and movies to keep its audience. ""While Netflix is still the biggest fish in the tank, if it wants to keep it that way, there is work to be done,"" she said, adding that it should focus on markets outside the US where there is more growth potential. Netflix also announced it was promoting chief content officer Ted Sarandos to co-chief executive. ""This change makes formal what was already informal - that Ted and I share the leadership of Netflix,"" chief executive Reed Hastings told investors.","Netflix has seen a surge in sign-ups due to the coronavirus lockdown, but has warned investors that subscriber growth will slow."
"The losses come weeks after the firm said it would cut 1,100 jobs and close 73 restaurants. No further restaurants will close, it says, with this volley of losses split across the remaining sites. City centres are worst hit by the restrictions, it said, as diners stay at home or order food in. ""Our aim throughout these extremely challenging times has been to keep our team members and customers safe and to retain jobs for as long as possible,"" Zoe Bowley, Pizza Express managing director said. ""Unfortunately, the recent increase in Covid-19 cases is again causing footfall to decline across the UK."" The company didn't say which roles are likely to be cut, nor which locations will lose staff. Pizza Express went through a restructuring in the summer to cut its rental costs, which led to the first volley of job cuts and closed venues. The company, which began with one restaurant in London's SoHo district in 1965, is majority-owned by Chinese investor Hony Capital, which bought it for £900m in 2014. Hospitality hit Two weeks ago Mitchells & Butlers, the pubs and restaurants group, said it had begun redundancy consultations with a number of staff as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. M&B, whose chains include Harvester and All Bar One, has about 1,700 pubs and restaurants and 44,000 employees. It has not yet disclosed how many jobs are at risk. The cuts came amid warnings over large job cuts in large cities like London, where city centre bars and restaurants are particularly hard hit as diners stay at home. Tougher Tier 2 Covid restrictions will put up to 250,000 jobs at risk in London's hospitality sector, according to the industry's trade body UK Hospitality . Chief executive Kate Nicholls said that without additional government support thousands of jobs in the capital will go. British employers planned making redundancies at close to a record level last month, as the second wave of coronavirus took its toll on jobs. Some 1,734 employers notified the government of plans to cut 20 or more posts, close to the peak levels seen in June and July, according to data released to the BBC after a Freedom of Information request.","Pizza Express will cut 1,300 more jobs across its 370 UK restaurants after sales dipped amid more coronavirus cases and restrictions."
"It now expects the economy to grow 2.4% this year - faster than any other major European economy - against its previous forecast of 1.9%. In 2015, it expects growth of 2.2%. The Treasury said the new UK forecast was further evidence that the government's economic plan was working. The IMF also raised its global growth outlook slightly to 3.7%. ""Global growth is expected to increase in 2014 after having been stuck in a low gear in 2013,"" the IMF said in its report. The world's largest economy, the US, is expected to grow by 2.8% this year, an improvement on the previous estimate of 2.6% that the IMF made in October. It expects the euro area as a whole to grow by 1%. ""The euro area is turning a corner from recession to recovery,"" the IMF said. However, it added the pickup would be weaker in economies that have been facing ""financial stress"", namely Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Italy and Portugal. The IMF also upgraded its forecast for the Chinese economy to 7.5% this year. But it also warned that ""strengthening global growth does not mean that the global economy is out of the woods"". It said governments in advanced economies must not withdraw measures to support growth prematurely. Rising confidence Christine Lagarde, the IMF managing director, has previously expressed concerns about growth levels in the UK economy in light of the government's austerity drive, which is designed to reduce debt levels. But the IMF upgraded its forecast for the UK in 2014 by more than for any other economy. It also raised its forecast for growth in 2015 to 2.2%. ""[The IMF] report provides further evidence that the government's long term economic plan is working,"" said a spokesperson for the Treasury. ""But the job is not yet done and so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions necessary to deliver a sustainable recovery for all"". Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ""After three damaging years of flatlining, any growth is both welcome and long overdue. ""With business investment still weak and the IMF forecasting that UK growth will slow down again next year, it's clear that this is not yet a recovery that is built to last."" The IMF forecast is now in line with that of the UK's Office for Budget Responsibility's estimates for 2014. On Monday, the EY Item Club of economists said it expected the UK economy to grow by 2.7% this year. Confidence in the UK economy has increased markedly in recent weeks, with unemployment falling, the manufacturing sector and retail sales recording strong growth, and inflation back at the government's 2% target rate. Further evidence of the recovery came on Tuesday with publication of the CBI business group's Industrial Trends Survey. This found that growth in new manufacturing orders was at its strongest since April 2011. ""The recovery in the manufacturing sector is continuing to build and confidence has improved,"" said Stephen Gifford, the CBI's director of economics.",The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sharply increased its growth forecast for the UK economy.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter A total of 22,503 people were left with unmanageable debts in the second quarter of the year, official figures from the Insolvency Service show. That was a 22% rise on the same period last year, the data covering England and Wales show. But an extensive period of low interest rates is expected to continue. This is likely to keep a lid on the number of people falling irretrievably behind on loan repayments. Picture across the UK The rise in personal insolvencies were driven by a 15% rise in Individual Voluntary Arrangements - when those in debt come to an agreement on repaying debt with those to whom they owe money. More traditional bankruptcies, when a debtor's home is at risk, have fallen in number. Elsewhere in the UK, there was a 50% rise in individual insolvencies in Scotland over the same period, with 2,405 people going insolvent in the second quarter of the year. There were 755 individual insolvencies in Northern Ireland in the second quarter of the year, an 8.5% rise on the same quarter a year ago. Bankruptcy and alternatives Bankruptcy: The traditional way of escaping overwhelming debt. Ends after one year, but you are likely to lose all your assets, including your house, to pay something to the creditors Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA): A deal between you and your creditors, overseen by an insolvency practitioner. Less stigma, less chance of losing your home, but involves paying some of your debts in one go. Debt Relief Orders: Introduced in April 2009, these allow people with debts of less than £15,000 (£20,000 since October 2015) and minimal assets to write off debts without a full-blown bankruptcy",The number of people being declared insolvent has risen by a fifth on a year ago - but low interest rates mean the total is still comparatively low.

Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross lowered expectations for economic growth this year, saying that the Trump administration's economic agenda was not far enough along to produce a 3% rise in economic growth. Many economists had already forecast less ambitious growth, but the statement underscored disarray in Washington. It came amid a backlash over Mr Comey's removal, which is likely to make passage of some of his business-friendly economic initiatives, such as tax reform, more difficult. Mr Comey was leading an investigation into ties between Russia and US President Donald Trump's campaign. His dismissal provoked strong reaction from Mr Trump's Democratic opponents and also raised concerns among some Republicans.","Wall Street stocks shrugged off morning declines, closing Wednesday mixed after the abrupt firing of FBI director James Comey signalled more political upheaval to Washington."
"By Alan Johnston BBC News, San Marcellino, Italy But the compound, with its warehouse and offices, lies in the heartland of the formidable Neapolitan crime network, the Camorra. And Euromilk, on the outskirts of the community of San Marcellino, used to be the property of mafiosi managers. Now though, it is trying to shed its past. This business is among many hundreds that have been seized from the mafia and put under the control of Italy's National Agency for the Management of Assets Confiscated from Organised Crime. It tries to draw these firms away from their roots in the underworld, and sell them on to honest owners. But only a tiny number of confiscated companies survive the complexities of that transition. 'Most wanted' According to the agency, Euromilk was owned by a member of one of the toughest Camorra clans, the Casalesi. The gang's leader, Michele Zagaria, was among the most wanted men in Italy until he was arrested last year. He was captured hiding out in an underground bunker not far from the Euromilk compound. ""The company was confiscated because the person responsible for the firm was declared a member of one of the local clans,"" says Gianpaolo Capasso, the head of the Agency in the Campania region. The fact that the business was in the hands of such a person was enough to warrant its seizure, whether or not it was operating illegally. And after confiscating it, the agency put in charge a new, caretaker manager, Giuseppe Castellano, who has experience of taking over troubled or bankrupted companies. So how did it feel, coming to assume control of an enterprise where the senior members of staff would have been used to working for the former, mafiosi boss? ""Of course they weren't happy,"" says the smiling, understated Mr Castellano. ""But I was never afraid. I tried to explain to them that there was a common interest, which was to keep the company running. ""I was also a bit lucky. I found people willing to help and thanks to that, the company is still here."" And the fact that the firm remains in business several years after it was seized is indeed a kind of victory. Very often enterprises taken off the Mafia close down soon afterwards. In the region around Naples the agency has confiscated about 300, but it has only managed to keep six of them running. Corrosive idea And that is a problem. When the mafia sets up a firm, it creates employment. And too often when the state confiscates the asset, the company collapses and the jobs are lost. ""The state fires people, while the Camorra gives jobs,"" is a complaint the confiscation agency's officers often hear. And this is exactly the sort of corrosive idea that the mafiosi would like to promote - the notion that in practical terms, communities might be better off with the gangsters than the rule of law. So how does the agency try to get round this? What does it do when it suspects that some of the most senior figures in the workforce of a confiscated firm are loyal to the former management, and might still have active mafia links? ""You know that if you fire those three or four key members of staff the company would shut down immediately, and all the workers would lose their jobs, including those who have no links,"" says Gianpaolo Capasso, the head of the agency in the Campania region. ""So we chose to allow these people to stay, closely controlling their activities, trying to limit any illegal activity on their part."" But Mr Capasso says that in the end, when the agency was about to sell off a firm to a new owner, those members of staff believed to have mafia connections were forced to quit. He says that in the specific case of the confiscated Euromilk Slr firm in San Marcellino, if it is sold, some employees will be fired. Corruption and intimidation Mafia bosses involve themselves in apparently legitimate business activity for different reasons. For a start it is possible to make good money out of a busy company in, for example, the construction industry. And that can be especially true if you bring to bear the ""business ethics"" of the mafia, such as intimidating competitors, or corrupting the local officials who hand out contracts. At the same time, a superficially legitimate business can be used to launder money made in criminal activity, such as drug trafficking. A mafia boss's children or other relatives might need access to money that at least looks as if it has been earned in a conventional manner. So having a foot in the world of legality can be useful for the mafiosi in various ways. And the agency says there are mafia strongholds where the local business environment is so polluted by the presence of gangster-run enterprises that it is almost impossible for honestly managed firms to operate. To take just one of many possible scenarios, a legitimate company might be forced to pay protection money to the local mafiosi. But a competitor in the area, a firm run by the gangsters themselves, would obviously not be subjected to that kind of cost. Wealth and prestige A Rome-based senior spokesman for the agency, Dario Caputo, says ""there definitely are extremely difficult situations in which the social tissue is so damaged, the conditioning [by the mafia] is so strong, that there is a feeling that one lives in a different reality, outside legality"". ""We see this difficulty in small towns in some areas of the south,"" he says. But despite the many difficulties, Mr Caputo sees the confiscation of assets as an essential part of Italy's struggle with the Mafia. He says: ""What hurts the mafiosi most is not only going to jail for a certain period, it is also losing their wealth. ""Because this is what gives them prestige, makes them feel important in the eyes of common people.""","Sitting on the edge of a town outside Naples, the Euromilk dairy-produce distribution firm looks like any other small business engaged in a very ordinary trade."
"The company is launching a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), allowing it to shut loss-making sites. It said the current climate and ""changes in consumer behaviour"" meant that rents at some restaurants were unsustainable. Yo!'s boss Richard Hodgson said: ""While we have already taken measures to reduce costs, rents remain an issue. ""In the current climate, it's just not viable for us to keep any sites that no longer perform."" The company also said the CVA will mean it can exit nine sites where it no longer operates but is still responsible for the rent. 'Eat out to help out' Yo! Sushi currently has 59 restaurants and 10 concessions in the UK. It has adapted its conveyor belt delivery system to make diners feel safer in its restaurants in the age of coronavirus. The company is taking part in the government's 'eat out to help out' scheme, which gives people a discount of up to £10 per head if they dine at a restaurant between Monday and Wednesday during August. However, Mr Hodgson said: ""Like the rest of the sector, we need to take decisive action to adapt to the lasting changes that the covid pandemic has brought about."" ""While it's been a very difficult decision to make and I am very sorry that it will mean losing many of our team members, a CVA has become an essential measure to secure our business for the future, and enable us to protect as many jobs as possible.""

"By Anthony ReubenBBC Reality Check By next Tuesday, the OBR has to come up with forecasts of what will happen to the UK economy and the government finances over the next five years. The Act of Parliament that created the OBR said that its forecasts had to be based on government policies and ""may not consider what the effect of any alternative policies would be"". And here you see the problem facing the OBR in predicting what would happen to the economy and the public finances over the next five years. Government policy is to trigger Article 50 in March 2017, meaning the UK will leave the European Union in March 2019. The OBR is going to have to predict what will happen to the economy in 2019-20 and 2020-21 without knowing what sort of deal will be done with the EU, so it won't know whether the UK will be part of the single market or the customs union. The UK government does not officially have a policy on what outcome it would like or what the basis will be for its negotiations, beyond the ambition to get the best possible deal for the UK. The OBR's charter says: ""If necessary, where a long-term policy has not yet been set by the government, the OBR will set out the assumptions it makes in its projections regarding policy transparently."" Keeping the rebate So, we know the OBR will show its workings, which is good, but how does it choose its assumptions? There are endless arguments about what would be the best possible deal for the UK. There are those who argue that we would be better off outside the single market or that we should try to stay within the customs union, but I have yet to see anyone argue that it does not make any difference. So when the chairman of the OBR, Robert Chote, went to the Treasury and asked what government policy was, and hence on what basis he should prepare his forecasts, I wonder what he was told. If he was given the official line, then we can expect the OBR forecast to be based on the government's view of best possible deal, which will presumably involve remaining part of the single market while ending freedom of movement, stopping contributing to the EU Budget but still getting a rebate. And that's not going to be a very realistic forecast. The first three years of the forecast shouldn't be too difficult - we already have the Bank of England's forecasts for this period. But the final two years could be controversial. Some commentators, such as Paul Johnson who heads up the Institute for Fiscal Studies, suggested that there might be two forecasts for the last two years, one based on staying in the single market and one based on leaving it, but that may fall foul of the rules against considering alternative policies. Could government disagree? Instead, there could be a single forecast that is the average of those two figures, but then the forecast would be unlikely to be accurate whichever way the negotiations went. So either the OBR's forecasts will give an insight into the government's aspirations for the coming negotiations that we have not yet seen, or the independent forecaster will have to come up with a forecast based on not knowing what government policy is, which would be odd. But there's another potential problem. Some members of the Cabinet, including the foreign secretary, have disputed the conclusion of the vast majority of economists (and the Treasury) that leaving the single market would be worse for the economy than staying in it. The charter of the OBR allows the government to disagree with the OBR's forecast as long as it explains why it has done so in Parliament. But that would be an extraordinary situation. So while there may be interesting details of the government's fiscal policy announced in the Autumn Statement, the most interesting part will be contained in what the OBR does or doesn't tell us about the government's plans for our future relationship with the EU.",You have to feel the Office for Budget Responsibility's pain.
"Shares in the firm plunged after hours on Tuesday, after the firm reported losses of more than $400m (£337m) in the quarter. It also had lower-than-expected revenue and user growth. Snapchat said the changes would make the app easier to use and more compatible with Android phones. However, it warned the transition could be rocky. ""We're willing to take that risk for what we believe are substantial long-term benefits to our business,"" said 27-year-old chief executive Evan Spiegel. Snapchat pioneered the craze for disappearing messages among teens. Self-inflicted problems Analysis - By Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter, San Francisco When you have to put out a statement denying rumours you're shutting down within a year… that's when you know things aren't going particularly well. As well as denying it was going bust, in the past few months Snap has had to admit supplies of its Spectacles product, once the talk of the town, are piled high in warehouses. Revenues have been harder to come by than investors had hoped as the company struggles to turn around intense advertisers' interest - these are teenagers, after all - into a system that runs seamlessly and reliable ways to measure success. And just this week the network suffered a widespread outage. Some of Snap's problems are self-inflicted, others are inflicted by Facebook - a company that once tried to buy Snapchat, and which now relentlessly copies its best features. But it faces fierce competition from larger rival Facebook and Facebook's image-sharing network Instagram, which have introduced similar features. Learning from mistakes Snap said it had 178 million daily active users on average over the quarter, up 3% over the previous three months. The firm told investors it made almost $208m in revenue in the quarter, up 62% year-on-year. That represents about $1.17 in revenue per user, compared to Facebook's more than $5 in revenue per user. But Snapchat's ad prices have fallen. The firm also reported a nearly $40m loss stemming from excess inventory of its Spectacles product, sunglasses with recording capabilities, which proved less popular than hoped. ""We're learning from it and plan on avoiding a similar mistake in the future,"" Mr Spiegel said. Snapchat shares plunged more than 17% in after-hours trade, falling below $13. That extended the losses that started soon after Snapchat became a publicly traded company in March, when shares debuted at $17. The earnings report came less than a day after an outage on the service. Snapchat also had to address rumours it was shutting down.","Snapchat owner Snap says it is working to overhaul its signature messaging app, as it struggles to attract users and turn a profit."
"An attempt by minority shareholders in TNK-BP, the UK firm's Russian joint venture, to seek damages of $13bn (£8.5bn) from BP failed in November. The court rejected claims that the planned Rosneft tie-up had hurt TNK-BP. The new hearing comes as BP attempts to sell its 50% stake in TNK-BP after years of tensions with its partners. BP announced on Friday that it would pursue a sale of its TNK-BP stake after receiving unsolicited approaches. Analysts believe the 50% stake in Russia's third largest oil producer is worth about $30bn. But the new court move by unnamed shareholders could complicate BP's attempt to extricate itself from an already difficult situation. BP's involvement in Russia has been lucrative, but overshadowed by disputes with Alfa-Access-Renova, its partners in TNK-BP. AAR, run by a group of Russian billionaires, has said that BP could be in breach of contract if it discloses confidential information about TNK-BP to potential buyers. But the Reuters news agency reported BP as saying that it would ""meet our obligations under the shareholder agreement and expect Alfa-Access-Renova to do the same"". AAR has denied being party to the new lawsuit. The Federal Arbitration Court in the Siberian city of Tyumen has sent the case for hearing in a lower court, but no date has been set. There have been widespread reports that state energy holding company Rosneftegaz, which controls Rosneft, wants to buy BP's stake in TNK-BP. BP's attempted share swap with Rosneft last year was part of an ambitious plan by the UK company to develop oil fields in the Arctic. But the landmark deal was blocked in the courts by BP's partners.","A court in Siberia has ordered a new hearing into BP's failed bid last year to form an alliance with Rosneft, the Russian state oil group."
"By Esyllt CarrBusiness reporter, BBC News Alex, who doesn't want to use his real name, says it had never occurred to him to claim benefits - until coronavirus gave him little choice. A self-employed contractor in the construction industry, and part owner of a nightclub, he found he fell through the cracks of any government schemes to support workers. ""I've been a high earner and I think of myself as someone who gives back to the system, rather than takes from it"", he says. But with a family to support and bills mounting up, he finally turned to what he describes as the last resort. ""I swallowed my pride,"" he says. Stigma increasing In the first three months after lockdown, there were 3.2 million new applications for Universal Credit. But while the virus' economic consequences have been far reaching and unprecedented, research from the poverty charity Turn2Us has found that the stigma around claiming benefits has become more pronounced. One in four people surveyed by the charity in April said they believed claimants should be ashamed, up from one in ten of those asked in 2012. The survey also revealed that 44% of people don't think that those who claim benefits are treated with dignity and respect. The charity's Anna Stevenson - a welfare benefits specialist - says these feelings can deter people from claiming Universal Credit. ""It leads to people struggling unnecessarily when the support is there,"" she says. ""If we knew people were failing to get the medical help they needed because they were afraid of being judged by the doctor, we'd rightly see that as a national crisis - and yet, somehow when it comes to the welfare system it's just accepted as normal. And that's completely wrong."" A DWP spokesperson said Universal Credit had ""supported millions of people through the pandemic, with it processing ""10 times the volume of claims we'd normally expect during our busiest weeks and getting money into the accounts of those in urgent need within days."" ""This study seems out of step with that reality. ""The vast majority of people are satisfied with the service we provide and we're particularly proud that they feel fairly treated by us. In the latest Claimant Experience Survey, 81% of people were satisfied with DWP services,"" it added. 'I didn't want to tell anyone' However Alex says the stigma held him back from applying for support - running up credit card debt in the meantime. What he says made a difference, was the fact that during lockdown, the process was temporarily handled entirely online and over the phone. ""It certainly wasn't as bad as I'd imagined, based on what I'd read and seen on TV. I wish I'd done it sooner,"" he says. However, he admits the stigma remains. Now he's working again, he's still only told one person that he claimed Universal Credit. ""I've held senior, well-paid jobs, I drive a nice car and go on nice holidays. I was embarrassed."" 'I've worked for 30 years and never claimed a penny' Jamie Watt from Suffolk also found himself applying for benefits for the first time after being made redundant from his job as a quantity surveyor at the start of lockdown. ""Initially I was very reluctant"", he says. ""I've worked for 30 years and never claimed a penny. Not even when I was made redundant in 2008, but this time there was no prospect of work any time soon - I had no choice."" Jamie was told he was only eligible for job seekers allowance, and received that for five months until he found another job. He feels the pandemic has lessened the stigma around benefits - with lots of people finding that they're relying on state support in some form. ""The furlough scheme has helped so many people. When all is said and done, that's a government handout too and people are happy to accept it."" Turn2Us says its latest findings show reform is needed to tackle the current levels of stigma. Amongst other things, they're calling for those who use the system to have a say in how it's designed. ""The question is what the long term impact will be on this large number of new benefits claimants,"" says Anna Stevenson. ""We know that the experience of being out of work can cause increased anxiety and depression - and the additional weight of the stigma only adds to that.""",The coronavirus pandemic has seen record numbers of people claiming Universal Credit - but a poverty charity says its research shows the stigma around being on benefits has increased.
"Business Secretary Greg Clark says directors of all companies with more than 250 employees will be required to disclose and explain this difference - known as the ""pay ratio"". Equal pay campaigners, business and investor groups welcomed the plan. But the TUC said it was ""a first step"" and even tougher rules were needed. In recent years shareholders have become increasingly vocal over executive pay levels, and have voted against what they see as excessive pay awards, most notably the high sums paid to former WPP boss, Sir Martin Sorrell. But top level remuneration, particularly chief executives, is often linked to the performance of the share price. The new rules, as well as introducing the publication of pay ratios, will also require listed companies to show what effect an increase in share prices will have on executive pay, in order to inform shareholders when voting on long-term incentive plans. Welcome The plans, which will be presented to Parliament on Monday, follow concerns that some chief executives have been receiving salaries that are out of step with company performance. Mr Clark said: ""Most of the UK's largest companies get their business practices right, but we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses' pay is out of step with company performance."" The plans were welcomed by the Investment Association - that represents UK investment managers - as well as business lobby group the CBI and think tank the High Pay Centre. Chris Cummings, chief executive of the Investment Association, said investors wanted greater director accountability and more transparency over executive remuneration. ""Investors will expect boards to articulate why the ratio is right for the company and how directors are fulfilling their duties,"" he said. The director of the High Pay Centre, Luke Hildyard, said pay ratios could prove useful to investors, workers and society more broadly. ""We hope that [the move] will initiate a more informed debate about what represents fair, proportionate pay for workers at all levels,"" he said. The Confederation of British Industry's Matthew Fell said high pay was only ever justified by outstanding performance: ""This legislation can help to develop a better dialogue between boards and employees about the goals and aspirations of their business, and how pay is determined to achieve this shared vision."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for guaranteed places for worker representatives on boardroom pay committees, saying they would bring ""common sense and fairness to decision-making when boardroom pay packets are approved"". If approved, the regulations will come into effect from the start of next year, meaning companies will start reporting their pay ratios in 2020.",The country's biggest public businesses may soon have to publish the gap between the pay of their chief executive and an average worker.
"Walt Disney said about 28.6 million people had signed up for Disney+ since it started in November. The on-demand video service, which costs $6.99 per month, is Disney's attempt to challenge industry leader Netflix, which has 170m subscribers. Disney boss Bob Iger called the launch ""enormously successful"". Disney+ now has almost as many subscribers as the firm's earlier on-demand streaming service Hulu, which was founded in 2007 and offers shows from US television. ""The launch of Disney+ has been enormously successful, exceeding even our greatest expectations,"" Mr Iger said on a call with analysts after the release of the company's quarterly earnings. Disney also warned investors that its operating income in the next quarter could take a nearly $300m hit due to the closure of its parks in China. That figure assumes the coronavirus outbreak keeps Disney's resorts in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed for two months, and takes into account the fact that visitors to Hong Kong had already dropped significantly due to protests there. 'Accessible' price Disney announced in 2017 that it would create its own streaming service, aiming to combat the declining audiences for its traditional business as viewers move online. Shortly after, it announced a deal to buy the bulk of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox entertainment empire, as it looked to bulk up its catalogue to compete. ""I'm enormously proud of what we have accomplished in a relatively short period of time and believe we are well positioned to not only withstand the disruptive forces ... but to thrive,"" Mr Iger said. Most of the current subscribers come from the US and about half signed up directly through the website, he said. He attributed part of the appeal to Disney's ""very accessible"" price. UK launch International expansion of Disney+ is the firm's next priority, he added. The service is currently available in five countries, including the US and Canada. It is due to launch in the UK and other countries in western Europe next month. Mr Iger said the service will also launch in India in March. Disney said revenues in the quarter were up 36% year-on-year. However profits declined 25% from $2.8bn to $2.1bn, amid heavy spending on its on-demand offerings. Revenues in its direct-to-consumer unit - which includes Hulu and Disney+ - increased to $4bn, from $0.9bn, but operating loss widened from $136m to $693m. Disney shares rose more than 2% in after-hours trade.","Sign-ups for Disney's new streaming service have shot past expectations, as audiences respond to the offering of Star Wars, cartoons and other classics."
"Revenue from the iPhone, responsible for most of the firm's profits, fell 15% in its latest financial quarter. Overall the firm's revenue was down 5% from a year ago to about $84.3bn (£64.5bn). The slowdown had been expected after the tech giant warned investors earlier this month that revenue would be about $84bn, lower than expected. The firm had blamed the issues partly on an economic slowdown in China. But chief executive Tim Cook said customers were also struggling with the firm's high prices. He said a strong dollar, which makes its products comparatively more expensive, had hurt its sales in emerging markets. At the moment, according to Apple's official website, an iPhone Xs with a 5.8in display costs from $999 (£763) in the US compared with £999 in the UK and 8,699 Yuan (£989) in China. Mr Cook said the tech giant had started this month to re-price its phones to shield customers from the impact of currency fluctuations. ""What we have done in January in some locations and [for] some products is essentially absorb part or all of the foreign currency move as compared to last year,"" he said. Still, executives said they expected the firm's challenges to continue. Apple predicted revenue for the three months to 31 March of $55bn-$59bn - suggesting a drop of at least 3.4% year-on-year. ""The macroeconomic environment, particularly in emerging markets, will continue to be there,"" Luca Maestri, the firm's chief financial officer, said. Apple's struggles are not unique. Global smart phone shipments contracted 5% in 2018, according to Canalys, a market analyst firm. But the firm's share price has dropped by around one third since October, amid investor concerns that buyer appetite for iPhones is weakening. Fears intensified after the firm said it would stop reporting the number of iPhones, iPads and Macs it sold each quarter. However, Apple shares gained more than 4% in after-hours trade on Tuesday, as the firm proved more resilient than expected. Quarterly sales revenue dropped by more than 25% in its Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, compared to the year before. Sales also slipped about 3% year-on-year in Europe. But in the Americas - the firm's single biggest region - sales were up almost 5%. Revenue from the services business also jumped 19% to a record $10.9bn in the quarter, which ended on the 31 December. It's Apple's worst performing quarter for years, but that's not to say investors won't be mildly relieved. After the firm's warning earlier this month that it would be posting earnings well below expectations for what is typically its blockbuster quarter, investors were well-prepared to see the drop in iPhone sales, and as a result, revenues overall. That bad news was balanced out - perhaps even cancelled out - by the good news on services. A big increase compared to this time last year - 19% - and a very healthy gross margin of 62.8%. Apple is transitioning, slowly, into a different kind of company that isn't so reliant on hardware, and these numbers show that so far that transition is going well. With $245bn cash in hand, it can afford to splash out and make investors even happier with a major acquisition or two in the entertainment space (but then, I've been saying that for a while now!). Mr Cook said he remained confident in the business, pointing to strong sales of iPad and Macs, as well as growth in its services division, which includes Apple Pay. Overall profit in the quarter fell less than 1% to $19.97bn. ""While it was disappointing to miss our revenue guidance, we manage Apple for the long term, and this quarter's results demonstrate that the underlying strength of our business runs deep and wide,"" he said.",Apple boss Tim Cook has hinted it could lower iPhone prices in some places in an attempt to boost falling sales.
"It comes after Lord Peter Hain said the banks may ""inadvertently have been conduits"" for laundered money. The Labour peer told the House of Lords that up to £400m of illicit funds may have been moved by the banks. His concerns relate to links between South Africa's President Jacob Zuma and a wealthy business family, the Guptas. The peer has written to the Chancellor Philip Hammond, telling him a whistle-blower had indicated the banks ""maybe inadvertently have been conduits for the corrupt proceeds of money"". Lord Hain told the BBC he named 27 people in the letter, in addition to companies, adding that any person or firm linked to alleged corruption in South Africa is ""going to be badly contaminated"". The Treasury has referred Lord Hain's letter to regulators, including the Financial Conduct Authority, and the SFO. A Treasury spokesman said: ""We take allegations of financial misconduct very seriously, and have passed Lord Hain's letter on to the Financial Conduct Authority and relevant UK law enforcement agencies, including the National Crime Agency and Serious Fraud Office, to agree the right action."" The BBC's correspondent in Johannesburg, Andrew Harding, said Lord Hain's letter was ""a new twist in a giant corruption scandal that is shaking the South Africa state, and damaging the reputations of a number of global companies"". Mr Zuma and the Guptas strongly deny wrongdoing, and say they are victims of a ""politically motivated witch-hunt"". But leaked emails and official investigations have fuelled claims that the Guptas have bought influence in government in order to loot state enterprises. In South Africa, the scandal has already ruined British public relations company Bell Pottinger and damaged auditors KPMG, which removed its top executive team in the country. A spokeswoman for the FCA said it was already in contact with the banks named by Lord Hain and would ""consider carefully further responses received"". Standard Chartered said: ""We are not able to comment on the details of client transactions, but can confirm that following an internal investigation accounts were closed by us in 2014."" HSBC declined to comment. Lord Hain, a leading anti-apartheid campaigner who grew up in South Africa, urged UK authorities ""to track that stolen money down and make sure that British financial institutions help return it to South African taxpayers"". It is claimed that money was taken out of South Africa via Hong Kong and Dubai. Lord Hain, a former Northern Ireland secretary, alleged in his letter to the chancellor that the issue was ""a result of the corruption and cronyism presided over by President Zuma and close allies the Guptas"". During his Lords statement, the peer asked what steps the government was taking to prevent money laundering through UK banks. The minister, Lord Bates, said the UK is ""committed"" to fighting money laundering and is ""concerned"" at the allegations. He added that the high commission in South Africa is ""monitoring the issue closely"". Meanwhile, the Financial Times on Thursday reported that the FBI had opened an investigation into possible links between the Guptas and ""individuals, bank accounts, and companies in the US"". The Gupta brothers Ajay, Atul and Rajesh Gupta have interests in computer, mining, media, travel, energy and technology and employ about 10,000 people through their company Sahara Group.",UK financial regulators and the Serious Fraud Office are to review if banks HSBC and Standard Chartered are linked to a South Africa corruption scandal.
"Repayment could be ordered in the event of bankers' ""misbehaviour"", big losses at their bank or bad risk management, said the Bank. The banking system came under scrutiny after many banks were bailed out by billions of pounds of taxpayers' money following the credit crunch. Previously, the Bank had suggested repayments of promised bonuses. 'No longer safe' The bonuses would have been effectively cancelled, rather than clawed back from the bankers, who may have already spent the money. A spokesperson for the Bank of England said the new reforms were ""much more stringent"". BBC business editor Robert Peston said: ""This reform will worry bankers, because it means bonuses they have already pocketed are no longer safe for them and might have to be paid back."" Public trust Deborah Hargreaves, director at the High Pay Centre, said: ""I think claw back is a good thing and extending it to six years does give a chance for those bets to go wrong - some of them can take a while to come to light."" Ms Hargreaves added: ""What the public really sees, and I agree, is it is quite hard to justify getting a bonus if the bank is making a loss."" She said the public would find it easier to understand a system where bankers were not awarded bonuses if their bank failed to make a profit. 'Practical difficulties' The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was the latest bank to award its bankers bonuses despite reporting a loss. The bank's pre-tax loss for 2013 was £8.2bn, compared with £5.2bn in 2012, but it set aside £576m for staff bonuses in 2013, a drop of 15% on 2012. Of that sum, £237m went to investment bankers. It also recently awarded 11 of its directors a share package worth up to £18.25m. Simon Hills, executive director at the British Bankers' Association (BBA), said he supported the clawback reform, since if a bonus was paid based on ""conduct that has later been shown to be substandard, it is only proper that it should be returned"". But he added: ""However, we should not underestimate the practical difficulties of recouping money that has already been paid. ""The BBA will work with our members and the Prudential Regulation Authority in seeking to overcome those challenges.""","Bankers may have to return their bonuses up to six years after receiving them, the Bank of England has said."
"With floods hitting farmland in places such as Australia, which exports its wheat and sugar cane around the world, there are fears that food prices could continue to rise. In February, the wholesale cost of food hit its highest monthly figure on record, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Food prices remain higher than their peak in 2008, when food crisis prompted riots and demonstrations around the world. What's more, oil prices have also edged up this year, reaching their highest level in two years. Why are food prices rising? Following the 2008 peaks, good harvests for most basic foods helped prices to fall back. But in 2010, severe weather in some of the world's biggest food exporting countries damaged supplies. That has helped to push food prices almost 20% higher than a year earlier, according to the FAO. (The 2010 figure was slightly below the annual measure for 2008 as a whole.) Flooding hit the planting season in Canada, and destroyed crops of wheat and sugar cane in Australia. In addition, drought and fires devastated harvests of wheat and other grains in Russia and the surrounding region during the summer, prompting Russia to ban exports. As a result, wheat production is expected to be lower this year than in the last two years, according to US government estimates, although it will still be the third largest on record. But crucially, production is expected to lag behind the growing demand for food, which is another key factor pushing up prices. Have the prices of all foods gone up? The picture is mixed. Rice, which is a staple in many Asian countries, hasn't risen by as much as other commodities because a record harvest is expected this year. In addition, some countries that don't rely on supplies from disaster-hit exporters haven't experienced the same price squeeze. Prices of maize in East Africa, for example, where it is the most important food crop, have fallen by up to 50% following bumper harvests. There have also been more localised weather problems. They have received less coverage - but are no less important to farmers and consumers in those areas. Onion prices soared in India earlier in the year, following heavy rains in the west, where much of its supply comes from. Like many governments around the world, the government has come under severe pressure to act, as onions are such an important part of the Indian diet. In Central America, lack of rain has damaged bean crops and caused the biggest individual price rises, according to a recent FAO report. The price of red beans, part of the staple diet in the region, has almost trebled in the past year in El Salvador and Honduras. What about speculators? The FAO says speculators who trade commodities on the financial markets are not to blame for the huge rise in prices, but they have made matters worse. Take sugar for example. Production has failed to keep up with the growing demand coming from developing countries, pushing prices sharply higher. But the Economist Intelligence Unit also points to the role of speculators, who spotted the situation as an investment opportunity and ""helped exaggerate"" the price rallies. The World Development Movement (WDM) is keen to curb this betting on prices. It wants greater regulation of the buying and selling of futures contracts - which are an agreement to sell a commodity at a certain price at a set time. These were created to reduce uncertainty as the producer has a guaranteed price and the buyer secures the goods they need. It is effectively a way for both sides to reduce the risk of doing business. But the WDM and others think that trading these contracts like stocks and shares is pushing food prices even higher to the detriment of the poorest people. And what's happening to the price of oil? The price of a barrel of oil topped $125 on the London market in April, the highest level for almost three years, although it has since fallen back towards $115 a barrel. Sharp rises followed political unrest in oil-producing countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Underlying this uncertainty is the rising demand for oil. Analysts point in particular to the thirst from China for energy to fuel its factories and power thousands of new cars. Like food, it is difficult to escape the impact of the rising crude prices. It not only directly affects the cost of fuel and energy, but also feeds into the prices of other goods by raising the cost of production and transportation. As many economies around the world struggle to recover from a painful global recession, wages aren't rising to keep pace. So many are really feeling the squeeze.",Food prices around the world have been rising sharply and Oxfam has warned that the trend will continue over the next 20 years.
"It reached the milestone just two years after becoming the world's first trillion-dollar company in 2018. Its share price hit $467.77 in mid-morning trading in the US on Wednesday to push it over the $2tn mark. The only other company to reach the $2tn level was state-backed Saudi Aramco after it listed its shares last December. But the oil giant's value has slipped back to $1.8tn since then and Apple surpassed it to become the world's most valuable traded company at the end of July. Strong sales The iPhone-maker's shares have leapt more than 50% this year, despite the coronavirus crisis forcing it to shut retail stores and political pressure over its links to China. In fact, its share price has doubled since its low point in March, when panic about the coronavirus pandemic swept the markets. Tech firms, which have been viewed as winners despite lockdowns, have seen their stock surge in recent weeks, even though the US is in recession. Apple posted strong third quarter figures towards the end of July, including $59.7bn of revenue and double-digit growth in its products and services segments. The next most valuable US company is Amazon which is worth around $1.7tn. Apple's rapid share price rise is ""an impressive feat within a short period of time"", said Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight. ""The last few months have underlined the importance of users and households alike to own better quality devices, connections and services and with Apple's strong broad portfolio of devices and a growing services offering, there are plentiful opportunities for future growth."" He said the arrival of gigabit connectivity broadband would offer Apple ""endless possibilities"". ""All eyes are now on the eagerly anticipated 5G iPhone which will fuel further consumer demand,"" he added. Microsoft and Amazon follow Apple as the most valuable publicly traded US companies, each at about $1.6tn. They are followed by Google-owner Alphabet at just over $1tn.",Tech giant Apple has become the first US company to be valued at $2tn (£1.5tn) on the stock market.
"The move comes ahead of Thursday's board meeting where the firm is expected to finally approve the project in Somerset - Britain's first new nuclear power plant in decades. The French state, which owns 85% of EDF, will buy 3bn euros-worth of new shares in the fundraising. The project is expected to cost £18bn. ""We need to boost our equity as market conditions are tough and we need to maintain the quality of our debt and our credit rating,"" EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy said. Hinkley Point C, which would provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirements, had originally been meant to open in 2017. But it has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity to handle the project. While one third of the £18bn capital costs of the project are being met by Chinese investors, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company and has been criticised by French unions. But last week, confirming Thursday's board meeting, EDF said Hinkley Point C was a ""major element"" of its low-carbon growth strategy. Earlier this month, the new Chancellor Philip Hammond said the government remained committed to building Hinkley Point, despite the rising potential cost to the consumer of the electricity it will produce. The UK government has guaranteed a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour of electricity - more than twice the current cost - for the electricity Hinkley produces for 35 years. Wholesale energy prices have fallen since the price was agreed, leaving the government to make up the difference. The UK's National Audit Office estimated future top-up payments would rise from £6.1bn to £29.7bn over the length of the contract.",Shareholders at French energy giant EDF have approved plans to issue new shares to raise 4bn euros (£3.4bn) to help pay for the nuclear plant at Hinkley Point.
"Sir Philip will take up the post at the UK pharmaceutical company in September next year. He joins at a tough time for GlaxoSmithKline, which was fined $490m (£297m) in China last week over bribery charges. Sir Philip took the helm of RBS, which is 80% owned by the taxpayer, at the height of the financial crisis. In a statement, he said: ""It has been a privilege to serve as chairman of RBS since 2009. ""I am looking forward to working with my colleagues in the months ahead as we work to implement the bank's strategy and continue to improve the support we provide to our customers."" Last week, GSK was found guilty by a Chinese court of paying doctors and hospitals to promote its products.

"Linda YuehChief business correspondent A US court has ordered Argentina to meet with its creditors ""continuously"" from today until they agree a deal. But, Argentina's lawyer said that a settlement ""can't be done by the end of this month."" In which case, Argentina would default. How did it get here? Argentina is refusing to abide by a previous US court order to pay all of its creditors, specifically the hold-outs who wouldn't agree to the ""haircut"" or loss that was accepted by the vast majority of bondholders. This has taken the country to the brink of another default. I previously wrote about the events that led up to this point. The refusal of the US Supreme Court to hear the appellate court case means that the lower court's interpretation of pari passu stands. That pari passu clause in effect means that Argentina must pay all bondholders and not just the ones who accepted the debt restructuring. Technical default looms Even if Argentina won't abide by US law, US banks processing the country's payments to its creditors do. So, by freezing the country's payments, they have already made it miss one payment on its debt that was due on 30 June. With a grace period of 30 days, the date of technical default is the end of July. Unless its negotiations with creditors yield fruit, Argentina could default again, within about a decade of the last one. Needless to say, there's a high degree of unpredictability about what will happen including in the country itself. More technicalities There's an added complication. Argentina says that there's a clause in the exchanged bonds known as RUFO (Rights Upon Future Offers) which will trigger it if pays the hold-outs before the end of the year. That would mean that all exchanged bonds would get the same treatment, i.e. full payment. President Kirchner says that payment would amount to $15bn (£8.8bn), which is about half of the entire central bank foreign exchange reserves, so it's not feasible for Argentina to do this. But, it also implies that it is possible for the country to pay creditors this time around. The looming question, though, is what happens with the next sets of payments. Why it matters There are at least 2 implications. First, when the IMF rescues a country, it sometimes advises on debt restructuring if the debt is simply too large to be repaid. Under those circumstances, creditors accept losses often because they are paid something if not 100%. But, if there is a pari passu clause like in these bond contracts governed by New York law, then hold-outs can sue for full payment which can make other creditors less inclined to accept a loss. In other words, how debt restructuring has been done is called into question. For instance, the IMF is considering extending the time to repay for debt to try and avoid debt write-downs. Secondly, a multi-tiered bond market could result. So, bonds issued under New York or English law with such equal treatment clauses may be viewed as more secure and command a higher price than bonds which don't. For bonds, the higher the price, the lower the yield, which translates into cheaper borrowing costs for those countries. For the eurozone which has begun to impose collective action clauses (CACs) in new bonds that essentially force bondholders to accept a debt deal if a large majority agree it, those bonds could become relatively more costly to issue. It would be an unintended consequence of their attempt to make future debt restructuring easier after the drawn-out process with Greece. In any case, the precedent of enforcing pari passu despite all that has been argued is now out there. For common law countries like the US and UK, precedent forms part of the law. So, at this point, Argentina has already begun to re-shape the global landscape with more still to play out as it stands at the precipice of yet another default.","In a week's time, Argentina could face another default. This time, there could be a severe impact not just in terms of economic growth but also on bond markets worldwide."
"It said firms that subsequently failed to meet their declared levels should have to explain why, but not face any penalties. The CBI added that the targets should reflect a company's existing number of female employees. It was responding to a review into the lack of UK female directors. This study is being conducted by Lord Davies, who will present his report to the government in February. The CBI is calling for its proposal to be added to the UK Corporate Governance Code. It wants all listed firms to report on the diversity within their companies on a ""comply or explain basis"". Explaining that the targets should reflect a firm's circumstances, it says a media company with a high number of female staff should set a higher target for the number of its female directors than an engineering firm with just a handful of women employees. The CBI said that a similar scheme due to be introduced in Australia next year had already resulted in a sharp rise in the number of female board appointments. 'Flexible system' CBI president Helen Alexander said: ""Boardrooms should harness the talents of the many, not just the few. ""Although women make up half of the population and more than half of university graduates, they remain woefully under-represented at board level. ""What is needed is cultural change, not quotas, ratios or tokenism. That is why we are calling for a flexible system that will allow firms to set targets that reflect the realities of their businesses."" Lord Davies said he welcomed the CBI's response. He added: ""I am pleased to see that this issue has got a strong push behind it from business, but as the recently published Cranfield report highlighted there has been too little movement on diversity in the boardroom for too long. ""To see a step change on this we need to everyone to pull together, British businesses and their shareholders, the government and the headhunting profession, to deliver the changes that will help women to achieve these roles."" The report by the Cranfield School of Management, which was published on 2 December, found that the number of female directors at the UK's leading 100 firms was almost unchanged for a third year running. It found 135 female directors out of 1,076 people on FTSE 100 boards, or 12.5%. The figure was 12.2% in 2009 and 12% in 2008, suggesting that the situation was stagnating.","All UK listed companies should have to set targets for the number of women in their boardrooms, the CBI business organisation has said."
"By Dominic O'ConnellToday business presenter The EU is expected to publish proposals for the new digital single market later this year. Vittorio Colao told the BBC it would be a missed opportunity if Britain ""tried to sit outside"". He said Britain could participate, but not help write the rules. ""The next big opportunity is in digital. Britain is particularly strong in digital, and it would be a missed opportunity if it tried to sit outside,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. Mr Colao said Britain would not be able to influence important decisions on copyright, e-commerce and and cyber security. Digital expertise ""There is a difference between being a neighbour and being a co-owner,"" he added. He said Germany had gained huge benefits from the current single market through the export of its goods and that Britain could do the same with its digital expertise. Vodafone is the seventh largest company listed on the London market, with operations in 26 countries and about 100,000 staff. Britain accounts for about 10% of its profits and sales. Mr Colao also hinted that FTSE 100 companies such as Vodafone could move their headquarters out of Britain if it left the EU. He said Vodafone was very happy here, but it would have to reconsider its position if the free movement of people and capital was restricted.",Vodafone's chief executive has warned Britain risks exclusion from plans for a giant new single market in digital services if it votes to leave the European Union.
"But he promised there would be no dilution of workers' rights. Measures under consideration include relaxing the working time directive which enshrines a 48-hour week. Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the government wanted to take a ""wrecking ball"" to hard-won rights. Earlier this week Mr Kwarteng said he wanted to ""protect and enhance"" labour law after the Financial Times reported that some rules could be weakened. The minister later told business leaders the UK had an opportunity to reform regulation derived from EU law, but would not deliberately antagonise the EU - its biggest trading partner - immediately after the Brexit deal. Confirming the review on Tuesday, Mr Kwarteng told MPs there would be no ""bonfire of rights"". ""I think the view was that we wanted to look at the whole range of issues relating to our EU membership and examine what we wanted to keep, if you like,"" he said. But he said ""the idea that we are trying to whittle down standards, that's not at all plausible or true"". 'High wage, high employment' Appearing before MPs, the business secretary said: ""I'm very struck as I look at EU economies how many EU countries - I think it's about 17 or 18 - have essentially opted out of the working time directive. ""So even by just following that we are way above the average European standard and I want to maintain that. I think we can be a high-wage, high-employment economy, a very successful economy, and that's what we should be aiming for."" Mr Miliband said that after denying the FT's report, Mr Kwarteng had now ""let the cat out of the bag"" in admitting the government was conducting a review. He warned that opting out of the 48-hour week would harm workers in key sectors like the NHS, road haulage and airlines from working excessive hours. ""A government committed to maintaining existing protections would not be reviewing whether they should be unpicked. This exposes that the government's priorities for Britain are totally wrong."" Drew Hendry, the SNP's business spokesman, echoed the criticism, accusing the government of planning an ""assault"" on workers' rights. 'Focus at home first' Meanwhile the boss of the UK's biggest recruitment firm, Reed, told the BBC's Today programme that there was ""no wish"" among employers to see ""a so-called bonfire of workers' rights. ""They must be protected because fair treatment is the bedrock of good workplace relations,"" James Reed said. The chairman of the firm said the government should instead focus on lower-paid workers and measures that could be taken to improve unemployment, which is set to rise further into mid-2021. ""I would suggest two things are looked at before any EU rules: The apprenticeship levy, which is clearly failing... and also National Insurance on jobs. It's a tax on jobs - how can that be improved? Especially to help the low-paid back into work."" Under the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, the UK has agreed to conditions that maintain fair competition, or a level playing field, between the two sides. However, the EU's ambassador to the UK, Joao Vale de Almeida, said Brussels could retaliate if Boris Johnson's government went too far in with deregulation. ""It will be for us to judge the extent to which it violates this principle of 'level playing field' and if that is the case there are mechanisms in the treaty, in the agreement, that allow us to discuss and eventually to come to an understanding,"" he said on Tuesday. ""If no understanding there are retaliation measures that can be applied on both sides.""",Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed the government is looking at scrapping some EU labour laws now it is no longer bound by the bloc's rules.
"In a speech in Birmingham, he also said that ""vast increases in fuel costs"" were squeezing people's incomes. The Archbishop was speaking at the annual conference of the National Housing Federation (NHF). Earlier this week, the NHF said that more than half of council tenants had been unable to keep up with their rent. It blamed the changes in housing benefit, described by the government as the end to the spare room subsidy, and by critics as ""the bedroom tax"". Justin Welby said that, when adding together the changes in housing benefit, higher energy costs and short-term loan costs, ""suddenly the possibility of growing and large-scale arrears becomes very serious"". ""And a sense, more seriously, of instability for people in already tough places becomes more and more real,"" he added. But the Archbishop went out of his way not to be critical of the government's welfare changes, most of which began in April. ""The principles of the changes have been carefully thought through over much time, and I am not making a party political point. But the realities of delivery are hugely challenging,"" he told his audience. Changes Archbishop Welby has previously been critical of the government's welfare changes. In March this year he backed a newspaper letter from Anglican bishops, who argued against the 1% cap on annual increases in most benefit payments. The bishops claimed the new limit could push 200,000 children into poverty. As part of its conference, the NHF also released the results of a survey, suggesting that most people were opposed to the changes in the housing benefit rules. The poll of 2,000 adults revealed that 59% would like the government to reverse the changes. Under the new rules, any tenant with a spare bedroom loses 14% of their housing benefit, typically amounting to between £14 and £16 a week. Anyone with two spare bedrooms loses 25% of their benefit. But the government has always insisted that the changes were fair and necessary. It has forecast that taxpayers will save £1bn in the first two years of the new rules. In July 2013, Justin Welby also spoke out on secular matters, by saying that he wanted to compete payday lenders like Wonga out of business.","The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has warned about the possibility of ""large-scale"" and ""growing"" rent arrears."
"By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News Just 19 years old at the time, and with no experience in the advertising world, the Swede found a cheap office and launched his agency. The young entrepreneur says it was more fun than partying on a beach in Thailand. ""It was like forming a really cool band,"" says Mr Waldekranz. ""It felt like an amazing hobby."" With his equally inexperienced childhood friend Kaj Drobin also coming on board, they immediately realised what they would have to do to succeed. Mr Waldekranz says: ""We had a very simple business model - work twice as much for half the price as our competitors and it will equal success. ""We'd take any job we could, we had no pretensions, we'd help set up lighting [at shoots], carry seats, do whatever manual labour needed doing."" Such an approach proved successful, helped in turn by their self-taught skills as website designers at a time when clients wanted more online advertisements. And so the agency - Super Strikes - grew quickly until Mr Waldekranz eventually sold up to a much larger rival in 2009, when he was 23. Now 27, and the chief executive and co-founder of Tictail - an online platform which allows small retailers around the world to set up their own websites - Mr Waldekranz says his approach to business remains the same - just give things a go and work hard. Big plans Although still in its infancy, Tictail has ambitions to be as big as the likes of eBay and Rakuten. Founded in 2011 by Mr Waldekranz and three friends, it claims to be so easy to use that small firms can build their own web page and start trading in just 10 minutes. More than 35,000 businesses now use Tictail to trade online, and for the basic service they don't pay a penny. Instead TicTail only starts charging retailers when they want to buy more advanced features, or apps, such as alerting customers when products are back in stock, or sending out discount vouchers. Mr Waldekranz and Mr Drobin first started tinkering with the idea for Tictail when they were still ad men. After Super Strikes was bought out, they continued to work for the new parent company while thinking about what they could do as their next start-up venture. With another friend coming on board with the computer programming expertise to complement Mr Waldekranz and Mr Drobin's website design skills, the three would work on the idea for Tictail every weekend. Mr Waldekranz says: ""Rather than quit the day jobs, we decided to meet up every Friday night in my kitchen, and we'd work until Sunday night. ""We did that every weekend for six months until we had built the first version of Tictail. It was so intense but fun. ""We'd all put half our salaries away to invest in Tictail, and we'd take fake vacations - we'd say we are going away on holiday, but ultimately we'd go to my apartment and work on Tictail."" ""Then eventually we decided to quit our jobs and work on Tictail full time."" Buddy system With Stockholm-based Tictail opening for business in 2011, with a fourth co-founder on board, its first customer was Mr Waldekranz's mother, a designer of porcelain. Mr Waldekranz says that as it was easy enough for his mum to use, he knew it would be popular with other traders who weren't used to using technology. High profile investors have also been quick to recognise Tictail's potential, with money coming into the business from senior figures at Swedish music streaming service Spotify, and German venture capitalist Klaus Hommels, who was an early investor in Facebook. But still with just 14 members of staff, Mr Waldekranz says that while customer numbers are growing quickly, Tictail itself is only expanding very carefully. ""We have a buddy system, which means that if we take on a new member of staff, he or she has to have a buddy for six months. And that buddy must have worked for Tictail for at least the same amount of time. ""This approach prevents us from growing too quickly and losing our culture."" On a daily basis, Mr Waldekranz says his job as chief executive is about focusing on one task or hurdle at a time. He says: ""At the beginning it was my job to find an office, then to get our first staff, then the first round of investment, and so on. ""There is always one hurdle after another. The key is to focus on just one problem at a time. That way it never feels impossible."" For any would-be entrepreneurs thinking of setting up their own companies, Mr Waldekranz, the ad man turned internet boss, has three pieces of advice - do it with friends, make sure it is something you enjoy, and don't put it off because it is never the right time to start a business. ""The worst thing that can happen is that you eventually have to apply for another job after a cool experience.""","While most of Carl Waldekranz's classmates went travelling when they graduated from their high school in Stockholm, he decided to set up an advertising agency instead."
"On Thursday, the government said it would offer cheap loans and the option to defer corporate taxes to some firms. The car and tourism sectors have been hit by boycotts enforced by Beijing on South Korean goods. The trade curbs came in retaliation for a shield deployed by the United States to protect South Korea. The Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system was installed to earlier this year to guard against North Korea's shorter-range missiles The move has drawn fierce criticism from China, which says the system's powerful radar will be used to spy on its territory. In response, Beijing imposed boycotts on South Korean goods traded in China. The corporate relief outlined on Thursday aims to shore up the losses suffered due to the trade curbs. South Korea's government will allow duty-free firms and other retailers operating in China to defer all or part of their corporate income and value-added taxes for up to nine months, the finance ministry said. It will also offer cheap loans to car-component makers hit by declining sales of South Korean vehicles in China. Hyundai Motors sales slumped 29% in China, the world's biggest car market, during the first half of the year, partly due to the Thaad backlash. Tourism relief The government also said it planned to boost domestic tourism to offset falling rates of Chinese visitors, which has dealt a multi-billion dollar blow to the local economy. The number of Chinese tourists, which used to account for about 50% of all visitors to South Korea, halved in the first seven months of the 2017, compared to a year earlier. According to data from the Korean Tourism Organisation, that translates to $5.1bn in lost business for South Korea.",South Korea will provide support to companies hurt by trade sanctions imposed by China over the deployment of a powerful defence system.
"By Hayley Hassall and Mick TuckerFile on 4 Lee Castleton, from Bridlington, East Yorkshire, was made bankrupt after he lost a two-year legal battle with the Post Office. A recent ruling found problems with the Post Office's accountancy software could instead be to blame for the losses. The Post Office has apologised and accepts its ""past shortcomings"". For two decades, the Post Office pursued hundreds of its workers over accounting discrepancies with its Horizon IT system, accusing people of theft, fraud or false accounting. Many were fired, made bankrupt or even sent to prison. Mr Castleton described how he and his family were abused, including an incident where his daughter was spat at, because ""local people presumed I was a thief"". The former stockbroker, who bought a seafront Post Office branch in 2003, said he began to notice thousands of pounds in losses from his accounts within months of taking over the business. Despite calling the Post Office's helpline nearly every day for three months, he said: ""We just couldn't understand where the losses were coming from."" Following an audit, Mr Castleton's branch was found to have a £25,000 shortfall. He was subsequently suspended. The Post Office spent the next two years pursuing him for the missing money through the civil courts. ""The Post Office decided to make an example of me,"" said Mr Castleton. He was forced to defend himself in London's High Court because he had no money to hire a lawyer. When he lost the case, he was made bankrupt. Mr Castleton is now one of more than 550 former postmasters who will get a share of a £58m settlement from the Post Office. The agreement was reached in December last year, when the High Court ruled that technical problems with the Post Office's Horizon IT system could instead be to blame for losses - something Mr Castleton and the other claimants had always believed was the case. 'No space for honesty' Internally, some Post Office staff had also grown concerned about what was happening. Speaking out for the very first time, one former manager told the BBC's File on 4 the Post Office had ""zero interest"" when he questioned why increasing numbers of postmasters were being blamed for losses totalling millions of pounds. The former staff member, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he voiced his concerns after reading internal documents. ""I didn't like what I was finding but was told it would be better for my career to 'move on and let it go',"" he said. He said he and a number of colleagues ""began to feel increasingly uncomfortable but there was no space for honesty, no desire for open dialogue"". ""The people running our stores were being arrested going to prison, losing their life savings, having massive mental health issues. It felt as though doing the right thing no longer mattered, it was all about saving the image of the Post Office"". He said: ""A fellow member of staff asked one manager why they thought there was such a high volume of fraud. The manager laughed and said 'because half the post offices are run by ex-police who took early retirement or former pub landlords so they're probably used to fiddling the books'. ""I think it was meant as a joke but it betrays a subtle contempt for the people on the front line."" ""Protecting the brand"" Ron Warmington, from the forensic accountants 'Second Sight', was brought in by the Post Office in 2012 to look at around 150 cases. In his first ever broadcast interview, he told File on 4 that as his findings became more critical of the Post Office, it became increasingly difficult for him to access the information he needed. ""It's the way that corporations behave when things go wrong,"" he said. ""And it was in that area that we found it so strange, the way the Post Office was reacting, presumably to protect the brand."" In 2015, the Post Office ended the investigation without notice but not before Mr Warmington had spoken to dozens of postmasters. ""I've spent decades dealing with some of the worst criminals in the world,"" he said. ""What struck me here was that I wasn't dealing with people like that. ""These were ordinary people that had simply found something that they couldn't deal with. They sought help but didn't get it and were put in a situation that frankly was life-changing for them."" The Post Office declined an interview but said it has ""accepted its past shortcomings"" and ""sincerely apologised"" to those affected. File on 4's 'Second Class Citizens: The Post Office IT Scandal' is on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday 11 February at 20:00 GMT and available afterwards on BBC Sounds.","A postmaster says the Post Office spent £320,000 suing him over £25,000 he was falsely accused of stealing."
"By Dan AscherBusiness Reporter Last year's rolling closures forced Martin Wolstencroft to borrow £4m just to ensure the survival of Arc Inspirations, a bar chain with 17 venues across the north of England that he has spent the last two decades building into a successful business. And the latest lockdown has forced Mr Wolstencroft to ask his bank to lend him another £1m. He is far from alone. UK Hospitality says the closure of pubs, restaurants and hotels is costing business owners such as Mr Wolstencroft a total of £500m a month, even allowing for any government support. And that has led to a huge rise in debt. ""The money that we are borrowing is really just to stand still,"" Mr Wolstencroft said. ""We'll be coming out of this in a far worse position with far greater debt and it totally reduces our ability to grow our business for the future. ""And all of this has been brought about through no fault of our own."" He reckons the debt he has taken on so far will take the business six years to pay back, which leaves him facing some difficult decisions. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced a package of grants worth up to £3,000 a month per property to keep retail, hospitality and leisure businesses afloat until the spring. But Mr Wolstencroft, who pays rents of more than £16,000 a month on some of his bars, described the grants as a ""mere drop in the ocean"". Threat to jobs The effect of taking on huge debts with no prospect of reopening soon is a major threat to millions working in the hospitality sector. More than 1,600 restaurants closed last year, costing 30,000 jobs, says property adviser Altus. When bars, hotels and other hospitality businesses are included, almost 300,000 jobs were lost last year as a result of the pandemic, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. And that figure is expected to more than double in the first three months of this year alone. Kate Nicholls, the boss of UK Hospitality, predicts the total will hit 660,000 by the end of March. ""The longer that these restrictions are in place, the more rapidly businesses will simply run out of cash and be unable to to remain open,"" she said. A survey of the trade body's members revealed that 80% of businesses did not have enough cash to make it through to April. ""It's going to be unbelievably brutal in the first quarter,"" Ms Nicholls said. 'Very worrying' The latest lockdown follows a bruising Christmas period for the hospitality sector, which typically depends on a busy December to tide it over during January, traditionally a quiet month for pubs and restaurants. ""It's obviously very worrying for our industry,"" says Tim Hughes, who runs the Plough pub at Sleapshyde in Hertfordshire. ""They have banned takeaway sales of alcohol from pubs, but off-licences and supermarkets can carry on selling it,"" he said. Between them, Mr Hughes, his brother and his father run three pubs in the St Albans area. They have already borrowed £350,000 and Mr Hughes says the latest lockdown will force them to take on even more debt just to survive. Monthly fixed costs at each of the pubs run to £9,500 and only one of their venues qualifies for the full £3,000 grant, so Mr Hughes says the Treasury's support ""doesn't touch the sides"". It's the fourth time Mr Hughes has been forced to close the doors to the Plough - and each time it has cost him about £5,000. This time, he also had to give away £4,000 worth of jumbo pork, vegetarian and vegan Bavarian bratwursts, bought to give 2,000 customers a substantial meal in the pub's ""winter garden"" during the festive period. That was before an unexpected decision to put St Albans into tier three forced him to close the pub. He cancelled those bookings and refunded customers their £16,000. Ralph Findlay, the boss of Marston's, which has 1,700 pubs across the country and employs 14,000 people, said some pubs that had been forced to close their doors because of the lockdown would never reopen. Half of Marston's employees are under 25, he said. ""I really worry about the impact of this on their employment prospects in places where it's very difficult to find employment."" He has called for pubs to be given more time before they are required to pay business rates again, which will leave pubs facing an £800m bill as soon as the current rates holiday expires in March, according to the British Beer & Pub Association. That would force landlords, including Mr Hughes, to foot a bill that works out at £25,000 a pub. 'Kidding ourselves' ""We are kidding ourselves if we think that more debt upon more debt is going to be sustainable,"" said Stephen Welton, executive chairman of the Business Growth Fund. ""Past recessions have shown very clearly that it's coming out of a recession - when companies are short of working capital - that they fall over."" For Mr Hughes at the Plough, he is looking for all the support he can get to avoid being put into a ""bigger black hole"". A Treasury spokesman said: """"We've taken swift action throughout the pandemic to protect lives and livelihoods."" He said the grant scheme would continue to support businesses and jobs through to the spring.","Just when the hospitality sector thought things couldn't get any worse, it has been hit by another lockdown."
"The move lifted the price of oil, with Brent crude hitting a one-year high. ""Russia is ready to accede to joint measures to reduce [oil] production, and is calling on other oil exporters to do so,"" said Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""We support the recent Opec initiative to set production limits,"" he added. In late afternoon Brent Crude oil was trading up by 2.5% at $53.21 a barrel, just off the $53.73 high hit earlier on Monday. Speaking at the World Energy Congress in Istanbul, Mr Putin said that oil prices had ""more than halved"" in two years due to surplus production, provoking a ""cycle of decreasing investment"". 'Avoid fluctuations' He said that if the trends persisted, they would give way to oil shortages and ""new, unpredictable price hikes"". He expects to reach an agreement to support a cut at Opec's next meeting in November, he said. ""Of course, this will also cool down speculative activities and help avoid new price fluctuations,"" he said. In September, members of the The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) voted to cut production for the first time in eight years. The group's 14 members produce about a third of the world's oil and have been hit hard by falling prices, as has Russia. High prices Opec aims to agree to cut around 700,000 barrels per day at its policy meeting on 30 November in Vienna, bringing its output to 32.5-33 million barrels per day. But some analysts have questioned whether all of its members will stick to the agreement. Differences between Iran and its regional rival, Saudi Arabia, have thwarted efforts to reach a deal in the past, and Russia's latest intervention may have little impact, said John Hall, chairman at Alfaenergy group ""Russia and Opec have not worked well in the past, and while Vladimir Putin promising joint measures is welcome, whether he sticks to it is another matter,"" he said. ""You've also got to see the wider context: Saudi Arabia and Iran are in a proxy war in Yemen. It is still very doubtful they can come to an agreement whether Russia supports a cut or not."" 'US obstruction' However, John Kilduff, partner at New York energy hedge fund Again Capital, told the Reuters News Agency: ""Putin coming out to say Russia will be part of the initiative has added another layer of credence to the speculation there will be a coordinated cut. ""At some point, the market will call them on it and say 'show us the cuts'."" In his speech Mr Putin also criticised unilateral sanctions, suggesting the US had blocked the expansion of more oil pipelines from Russia to Europe. ""The authorities in certain countries have been telling businesses to close profitable projects, refuse to buy fuel supplied via the shortest possible routes and at attractive prices,"" he said. ""Such actions do nothing to increase the stability of global energy system and also of the global economy as a whole.""",Russia has said it will support a proposal by Opec to freeze oil production in order to reverse the slump in global prices.
"In a survey of 500 people, it found that only 35% picked the cheapest deal, when presented with bills in a new format. The new bills - being brought in by the energy regulator Ofgem - are designed to make charges easier to understand. Ofgem defended the changes, saying Which? had not taken account of all its forthcoming reforms. Since January, energy suppliers have had to advertise their tariffs in terms of two rates: The new tariffs are already used on price comparison sites, but the first bills showing them will not be sent out until 1 April. Previously, not all companies quoted a standing charge, and some quoted two tiers of unit rates, a higher and a lower rate. 'Too complicated' But the Which? survey showed widespread confusion when consumers tried to work out which was the cheapest rate on the new-look bills. Even amongst those who used a calculator, only half managed to spot the best deal. The following examples, taken from suppliers' websites, show why the new rates are still potentially confusing: Consumers not only need to so some mental arithmetic to work out the cheapest deal, they also need to know how much gas or electricity they use in a year. ""In spite of Ofgem's tariff reforms to simplify the market, consumers are still failing to spot the cheapest deal because energy pricing remains too complicated,"" said Richard Lloyd, the executive director of Which? The consumer group would like to see a single flat rate for energy, as happens with the price of petrol. Right Deal In an attempt to provide that, Ofgem will introduce a Tariff Comparison Rate (TCR) on bills from April, similar to an APR comparison on a loan. This is designed to combine the Standing Charge and the Unit rate into a single measure. For example, bills might show a TCR of 15.24p/kWh, which consumers should be able to compare directly with other suppliers. But Which? warned that TCR is calculated only for a medium user of energy, so it does not always provide an accurate guide for switching supplier. Ofgem said it had conducted widespread research amongst consumers before deciding on its reforms. ""We are confident that our reform package will make the market simpler, clearer, and fairer for consumers, and make it much easier for them to choose the right deal,"" said Philip Cullum, Ofgem's Consumer Partner.","New simplified energy tariffs are still too confusing, the consumer group Which? has claimed."
"By Ian HardyBBC News, New York Yet online he is occasionally called ""grumpy"" and even ""rude"". ""But he has been here for years and knows almost everybody who comes in,"" says his boss Vicky. ""He knows their sense of humour and has a gruff voice, and jokes around with a lot of people. ""Some people think he's being rude to them, because they don't know him!"" This is just one of the problems with online reviews, a lack of context. Others are dishonesty and paid-for puffery - annoyances that review sites such as Yelp, Amazon and Tripadvisor have been struggling to weed out for years. Such fake reviews and blackmail attempts threaten to undermine trust in the ""wisdom of crowds"" - reviews that many of us have come to rely on before we part with our hard-earned cash. Could better technology help restore confidence in the review system? Twitter testing The developers of a new mobile app from the UK, called Twizoo, say they have found a way of weeding out fake, paid-for and out-of-date reviews. The start-up, which is concentrating on restaurants initially, scrapes comments from Twitter, then collects and analyses them to provide what it claims is a more reliable stream of review data. Twizoo co-founder and algorithm writer Madeline Parra is clearly chasing industry leader, Yelp. ""We left 24 fake reviews on Yelp and all got through within a couple of hours,"" she says. ""But Twizoo expects users to have a full social media profile, tweeting about lots of different stuff, so it's a lot harder for a fake review to get through to us."" Twizoo gives users a ""Twitter credibility score"" that has to be earned over time. Tweets that come from a brand new Twitter account are automatically discarded and several tweets coming in at the same time about one particular restaurant are also considered suspicious. That stops friends and family of the chef or restaurant owner influencing reviews, for example. ""After three months, tweets count half as much as they did before,"" says Ms Parra. ""On Yelp, if a restaurant got a one star review five years ago, it still counts against that restaurant. ""Because our volume [of tweets] is so high we want to give our users not what was awful five years ago, but what is great right now."" Ms Parra also points out that tweets are more likely to be authentic because they are often sent between friends as recommendations. 'Quality over quantity' Yelp is incredibly protective of its ""secret sauce"" or more accurately its ""secret source code"" that makes up the algorithm used to weed out potentially false or over-enthusiastic five-star reviews. In fact, Yelp PR director Marco Bilello says only a very few people in the company know the exact formula. ""If everybody knew the ins and outs it would allow them to game the system,"" he tells the BBC, ""so we can't share that information. ""We believe in quality over quantity. That's why only 71% of our reviews that go through the recommendation software are eventually recommended."" He did reveal that multiple Yelp reviews for the same restaurant coming from the same IP address are given extra scrutiny. And those reviews that seem biased - from the likes of competitors and disgruntled employees - are flagged. Yelp also has people on the ground in many locations and an investigative unit looking out for restaurants offering incentives to customers in return for five-star reviews. Fraudulent reviews Amazon is also constantly tweaking its review system - star ratings now reflect how useful readers think a new review is and if it comes after a verified purchase. It also favours reviews that were written by a customer paying a standard price rather than a deeply discounted sale that may have only lasted days or even hours, but which may have resulted in an over-enthusiastic review. Amazon has also cracked down on dodgy reviews using the full force of the law. ""Since the beginning of 2015, we have brought lawsuits against over 1,000 defendants for reviews abuse,"" says Amazon spokesman Tom Cook, ""including both dishonest sellers and manufacturers who attempt to purchase fraudulent reviews, and the parties who provide and post those reviews."" Jobs reviews site Glassdoor rejects about 5-10% of its submissions, suggesting that it is harder to fake reviews about occupations and specific work places, and much less lucrative. Tripadvisor chief executive Stephen Kaufer recently sent out a letter warning hotels and other businesses to be wary of ""optimisation companies"" promising to manipulate travel reviews for a fee, and then attempting to blackmail clients if they try to back out later. Genuine article? The more we know about the person leaving the review, the easier it should be to weed out the fakers. Walt Disney World gives customers a wristband that can be used to open hotel doors, pay for meals and souvenirs, and get into attractions. Disney knows exactly where you ate, what you ate, where you went, what you bought, who your favourite characters are, what rides you went on, and even what you look like. That's a goldmine of data against which reviews could be checked. But Georgios Zervas, assistant professor of marketing at Boston University, says: ""You could imagine doing that, but I think it would be quite creepy. ""And most people would find it annoying and an intrusion of their privacy rather than anything else."" So despite being decades old, the concept of online reviews still has much further to go. One of the next big shifts is likely to be towards personalised reviews, delivered to you according to your age, location and, perhaps, experience. After all, a 16-year-old from Kansas and a 65-year-old from Maine might have very different opinions of a new lobster joint opening on the Las Vegas strip.

"The Dow Jones Industrial Average and London's FTSE 100 saw their biggest quarterly drops since 1987, plunging 23% and 25% respectively. The S&P 500 lost 20% during the quarter, its worst since 2008. The drops come as authorities order a halt to most activity in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Economists have warned the hit to the global economy is likely to be worse than the financial crisis, with forecasters for IHS Markit, for example, predicting growth will shrink 2.8% this year, compared to a 1.7% drop in 2009. No country has been left untouched. The data firm expects China's growth to sputter to 2%, while the UK could see growth drop 4.5%. The outlook for countries such as Italy and less developed economies is even worse. ""We remain very concerned about the negative outlook for global growth in 2020 and in particular about the strain a downturn would have on emerging markets and low income countries,"" the president of the International Monetary Fund, Kristalina Georgieva, said on Tuesday. In the US, one central bank analysis suggested the unemployment rate could rise to more than 32% over the next three months, as more than 47 million people lose their jobs. Globally, many indexes remain more than 20% lower than they were at the start of the year. A steep slide in oil prices, due to a drop in demand and a price war between producers, has compounded the problems on financial markets. Governments have pledged massive rescue funds, which has helped to lift share prices in recent days. On Tuesday, the FTSE gained almost 2%, while Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 saw more modest gains. But the main US indexes stumbled, with the Dow dropping 1.8%, the S&P 500 down 1.6%, and the Nasdaq off almost 1%. Energy and financial firms were among the worst performers in the quarter. Retailers, which have seen sales evaporate as stores closed, suffered some of the biggest losses on Tuesday, with Macy's down almost 9% a day after it said it would put the majority of its staff on unpaid leave. ""Despite monetary and financial stimulus, we expect volatility of equities to remain elevated as long as the duration and impact of Covid-19 remain unknown, oil prices stay depressed and earnings visibility is murky,"" analysts for US Bank Wealth Management wrote.",Stock markets around the world suffered historic losses in the first three months of the year amid a massive sell-off tied to the coronavirus.
"By David ReidTechnology reporter, Delhi It's a sprawling labyrinth of stalls selling every possible spice, mountains of nuts, sweets and incredible street food. And when you're done eating, you can sip sugary tea and get your sandals splashed by a chai wallah (someone who sells tea), defying gravity with boiling liquids. There are two ways to experience the place: get pulled along by the coursing crowd, or find out what's really hidden in its maze of alleyways with a guide. I met up with Prabhjot Kaur. She is no ordinary guide. During the week she works as an independent human resources consultant, but at weekends she indulges her passion for travel, history and culture, working as a guide. ""I do this because I like connecting with people,"" she says. ""I like to understand more cultures - where you can really get to meet people from different origins."" Providing a platform I got in touch with Prabhjot through Padhaaro - one of a number of start-up websites in India connecting tourists to guides. You scroll down a list of ""experiences"", which range from Royal Enfield rides and Segway tours, to meeting street kids through a local charity. The site then puts you in touch with your guide. For Prabhjot it has meant she has been able to buy into a simple formula: if you can't earn a living doing what you want, at least you can earn part of a living doing what you want part-time. ""If I would like to connect up with people myself, I would need a lot of capital to invest in a website and a platform to market myself,"" she says. ""Padhaaro is giving me that platform where I can get connected to such people."" Joining us on our tour of the market was Akanksha Rastogi. She is a programmer based in Delhi's hi-tech satellite, Gurgaon. She loves to shop, and was brimming with praise for Prabhjot's itinerary of fabric boutiques. ""She is fantastic. I love her company,"" she beams. ""I am enjoying shopping. Going to different places and buying stuff."" While it's obvious that both Akanksha and Prabhjot are getting something from a business that connects individuals offering a service with those looking for one, how different is this kind of tourism from the more traditional kind? People, not just places On the other side of Delhi I met the co-founders of another site, SeekSherpa. Dhruv Raj Gupta feels there is something special about taking a tour with someone for whom it is a passion, rather than just another day at work. ""The person taking you around is as much value as the place he is taking you to,"" he says. ""We want the person's personality to be really powerful and as much as part of the tour as the place you are going to is."" The idea then is that an expert, history buff or even local resident is going to offer tourists insights and enthusiasm missing from the well-rehearsed spiel of a jaded tour guide. The currency these sites are trading on is authenticity. But is authenticity enough to build a business on? There are doubts. The model might work for tourist and guide, but the website's cut, about 20-30% on each transaction, might not be enough if the volume of tourists is low. As Piyush Mathur, the president for the consultancy Nielsen in India, suggested to me, the market for tour guides may only be large enough to support one player, if that. ""I think there is always a first mover advantage in any start-up,"" he says. ""Margins are fairly thin, even negative, in the beginning. ""It is not just about working a business model and hoping that at some point it will come. I think at some point in time, you have to start showing that this business model is working."" Regulatory hurdles Another problem with the online model is that sites like these are essentially brokers. They are using ad-hoc workers who themselves become mini-businesses. If this all sounds familiar, it's because web-based taxi firms such as Uber work a similar model - acting as middlemen for cab drivers. This does not augur well in the Indian context. A recent rape allegation against an Uber driver in Delhi shone a spotlight on the potential hazards of inadequate vetting, when your company pitch is to open up an industry to all-comers. The Indian government wasted little time in banning all online taxi firms. Tourist safety is a sensitive issue in India. It was underlined only last week, with the emergence of allegations from a Japanese student that she was abducted and repeatedly raped during a month of captivity. Police said two men had approached the victim as tour guides. ""Indian rape case echoes claims of tourists as prey"" ran the headline in the New York Times. The question for websites connecting tourists to local guides is whether they will be vulnerable to regulatory oversight amid these wider safety concerns. SeekSherpa's other co-founder, Sukhmani Singh, admits: ""There are legal and regulatory issues that might crop up."" However, she is confident that India's Ministry of Tourism will see their business model ""as more of a boon than a bane, and is going to be on our side"". Perhaps a guided tour is a fundamentally less sensitive business compared to ferrying people in a closed taxi. These are the kinds of regulatory challenges truly disruptive business models throw up. To succeed start-ups have to overcome them.",If you really want to rub your face in old India then Delhi's Chandni Chowk is your place.
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) studied the price of 17,000 items between September 2015 and June 2017. It found 206 products in all categories had shrunk in size, while 79 increased. The Brexit vote sparked a fall in the pound and a rise in the price of imports. But the ONS said this did not lead to a pick-up in shrinkflation. ""There was no trend in the frequency of size changes over this period, which included the EU referendum,"" the UK statistics body said. Among bread and cereals the ONS found 36 cases of shrinkflation. The next two categories with the largest number of shrinkflation cases were meat and confectionery. But most categories also saw some products increase in size. There were 18 increases in size among the bread and cereal category, and 13 meat products where this happened. But the category most likely to rise in size for the same price was tobacco, where there were also no examples of packets shrinking. Bigger and smaller Shrinkflation is not a widespread problem, although products are much more likely to contract than expand. The ONS estimates that in 2016, just 1-2.1% of food products in its sample shrunk in size, while 0.3-0.7% got bigger. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, said: ""Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises."" Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said there had been few cost increases recently: ""In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued. ""The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn't spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.""","Bread and breakfast cereals are the most likely to be affected by shrinkflation, whereby a product shrinks in size but its price doesn't."
"By Alistair JacksonBBC Panorama And even before they'd spent a penny of it, the fund paid out a political dividend. The promised cash quickly shifted the debate from what should have been done to prevent SSI's collapse to what happens next? The comparison with previous threats to the steelworks in the north-east of England couldn't be starker. Six years ago a Save our Steel campaign did just that - brought steel production back to Redcar. This time, even though Save our Steel posters can be seen all across town, there seems to be little real expectation that the trick can be pulled off twice. Redcar is left with a lingering sense of abandonment - and some very important questions. What's the £80m really for? How will it be delivered and, perhaps most crucially, can it really make any real difference to the community's future? Tough questions We already know the challenge is daunting - redeploy more than 2,000 workers who are highly skilled, but whose training is specific to an industry that has now gone. But it will get even tougher than that - it's estimated by enterprise agency Tees Valley Unlimited that 900 have lost their jobs in the supply chain, a number that rises daily. At first, details of exactly how this fund would be spent were unclear. The Business Secretary Sajid Javid's original announcement said only that ""full details of the package are being worked through"". But now more information is beginning to emerge. £30m has been set aside for redundancy payments. £1.7m is being spent to help 50 former SSI apprentices finish their training at other employers. Less optimistically, £2.4m has been earmarked for former steel workers who ""find themselves in crisis"". Another £16.5m is going on a ""Jobs and Skills Fund"" - to ""help local firms employ SSI workers or their spouses in full time or part time jobs for a minimum of three years."" A further £16m will provide support for firms in the SSI supply chain who have been hit by the plant's closure - and whose own employees could be facing redundancy before Christmas. Meanwhile, £5.65m is going on re-training and £750,000 on people starting new businesses. The remaining £7m is so far unaccounted for. But now it turns out the initial costs for redundancy payments were overinflated. It's now thought the total cost of redundancy payments is going to be nowhere near as much as had been initially set aside for them - and that could mean another £20m of the £80m unaccounted for. Business Minister Anna Soubry has given an assurance it will not be kept back by Whitehall and will still go into the overall fund. So up to £30m is still to play for. What can this money buy? Who is going to decide? What will it be spent on, and by when? These are the questions the local community wants answers to. Redcar is not unique - an industrial town dealing with years of globalization. Unemployment and regeneration have been big issues here for years already. It is, however, a resilient and proud town. In the next six weeks in the countdown to Christmas, we'll ask the residents what they want, what they can expect as we live their lives with them. We'll also ask what are towns like Redcar now for? From now until Christmas, the BBC's Panorama programme will be in Redcar to report on life after a century of steel making. You can follow the story on the Panorama Facebook page. Or search bbcpanorama on Snapchat.",On 2 October - the same day the government confirmed that the SSI steel plant in Redcar would close for good - it also announced an £80m support package for the town.
"Its shares rose 12% despite the company reporting its seventh consecutive quarter of falling underlying sales. Life-for-like sales, which exclude the effect of new store space, fell 1.1% excluding sales of fuel. Total sales excluding fuel were up 0.3%. Sainsbury's said it was making good progress despite ""food inflation impacting many categories"". The supermarket group said it now expected full-year underlying profits to be ""moderately ahead"" of analysts' expectations of £548m. However, that is still well below last year's figure of £681m. 'Still challenging' ""Both volume and transactions grew as the decline in average basket spend in supermarkets continued to stabilise,"" said chief executive Mike Coupe. ""Whilst the market is clearly still challenging, with food deflation impacting many categories, we are making good progress on delivering our strategy."" Part of the strategy involves having fewer special offers and instead having lower regular prices. The retailer cited particular progress on improving the taste and texture of its juice ranges and the ripeness and quality of its avocados. Sainsbury's recently announced a 4% pay rise for its staff, which came into effect on 30 August. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe might not exactly be cracking open the champagne this morning (even if it is on £14 special offer at his supermarket). But the fact he has been bold enough to suggest that profits might be slightly ahead of expectations in this morning's interim results is significant - it's unusual for Sainsbury's to say anything about profits in a trading update. The main reason is that although like-for-like sales (a measure of cash going through the tills) are still down, the decline is slowing and the actual volume of food being bought by each customer is up. And fewer promotions mean there are fewer ""demand surges"" for products, making supply chain management (the boring but vital part of the business) more efficient and cheaper. Half year results are in six weeks. Profits are likely to be down. But probably not by as much as initially feared. In common with the rest of the big supermarket chains, Sainsbury's has been struggling with competition from the discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl. Analysts at Bernstein Research suggested that the big rise in the shares was due to the more upbeat tone in the statement. ""The results represent a change of tone for Sainsbury's,"" they said. ""It has tried to take a cautious message up to now, that it will go 'toe to toe' with whatever price investment anyone else makes."" ""That it is talking up guidance is now showing they are more confident in their strategic position."" Sainsbury's also announced it had opened 27 convenience stores during the quarter and that clothing sales had been up nearly 13%.",Shares in Sainsbury's have jumped after it said full-year profits were set to be better than expected.
"The 1.4 million additional accounts were identified as part of a review the bank commissioned after the scandal came to light. The analysis also uncovered problems with the firm's online payment system. The bank has already agreed to pay more than $150m to customers. Much of that will go to settling a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of the bank's customers since 2002. Wells Fargo chief executive Tim Sloan apologised to customers and called the sales practices ""unacceptable"". ""To rebuild trust and to build a better Wells Fargo, our first priority is to make things right for our customers, and the completion of this expanded third-party analysis is an important milestone,"" he said. The study reviewed about 165 million customer accounts opened between January 2009 and September 2016, identifying ""potentially unauthorised"" accounts based on activity. The bank is now reviewing accounts back to 2002, Mr Sloan said. The data analysis may have produced some accounts that were in fact authorised, the bank said. Wells Fargo, one of America's biggest retail banks, has been in turmoil since revelations that the firm created millions of fake accounts to meet sales goals. and ignored or punished whistleblowers. The problems cost more than 5,000 lower level employees their jobs and led to the resignation of former chief executive John Stumpf. The bank also named a new board chair this month, after a divisive shareholder meeting in April. The firm's reputation has also been bruised by problems in other areas. For example, the bank said in July it would pay $80m, after wrongly charging about 570,000 customers for auto insurance.","US bank Wells Fargo says as many as 3.5 million accounts may have been created for customers without permission over about eight years, even more than previously acknowledged."
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent Some of the biggest powerhouses in US higher education are offering online courses - testing how their expertise and scholarship can be brought to a global audience. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have formed a $60m (£38m) alliance to launch edX, a platform to deliver courses online - with the modest ambition of ""revolutionising education around the world"". Sounding like a piece of secret military hardware, edX will provide online interactive courses which can be studied by anyone, anywhere, with no admission requirements and, at least at present, without charge. With roots in Silicon Valley, Stanford academics have set up another online platform, Coursera, which will provide courses from Stanford and Princeton and other leading US institutions. The first president of edX is Anant Agarwal, director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and one of the pioneers of the MITx online prototype. He puts forward a statistic that encapsulates the game-changing potential. The first online course from MITx earlier this year had more students than the entire number of living students who have graduated from the university. In fact, it isn't far from the total of all the students who have ever been there since the 19th Century. 'Tipping point' The internet provides an unparalleled capacity to expand the reach - but it also raises far-reaching and thorny questions for the traditional model of a university. ""We've crossed the tipping point,"" says Professor Agarwal. The courses being launched in the autumn, he anticipates, will have at least 500,000 students - and probably many more. As an example of how courses might be delivered, the MITx prototype taught an electronics course using an interactive virtual laboratory, e-textbooks, online discussions and video lectures. Assessment of the course, which took 10 hours per week, was entirely automated. ""This could be the end of the two-hour lecture,"" says Professor Agarwal. ""You can't hit the pause button on a lecturer, you can't fast forward."" Recorded lectures - available at the push of an iPad - could be more like text books, with universities using the best available. Assessing large numbers of online learners raises a big practical challenge - and edX is a laboratory to see how this can be developed. Michael Smith, dean of Harvard's faculty of arts and sciences, describes the ""incredibly important research opportunity"" provided by edX. ""We will collect enormous amounts of data from the edX platform about how students are interacting with the courses and online tools and assessments."" Degrees of degree Professor Agarwal wants to include social sciences and humanities subjects, which would require free-text answers - and he raises ideas such as peer marking among students as one approach. This might seem difficult now - but Professor Smith says online practices are constantly advancing. ""People interact with and receive information in new ways today, compared with even a few years ago. Universities like Harvard need to be in that space."" Accrediting such courses is another tricky area. The online courses are promised to be as rigorous as anything else from MIT or Harvard - but successful students will get a ""certificate of mastery"" and not a degree or any formal university credit. It's being set at arm's length from what's on offer for the paying customers. If students on campus are paying $50,000 (£32,000) per year, it's going to be difficult to give away qualifications to online learners without charge. High fees The edX project has the good fortune to have two wealthy parent institutions - and getting a financial return won't be a pressing necessity. But Daphne Koller, co-founder of Coursera, says the expansion of online courses will raise difficult questions about what mainstream universities offer for such high fees. Because if the content of university courses becomes freely available, what is it that students are paying for? Is it the interactions with staff? Or is it the time with other students? Is it something to put on a CV? ""This is causing universities to rethink their value to students,"" says Professor Koller, who is from Stanford University's computer science department. The most prestigious universities are always going to have enough demand for places - but the emergence of high-quality online courses could be tougher for middle-ranking institutions. Why would you pay high fees to sit through a mediocre lecture, when you could go online and watch world experts at another university, even if it's in another country? ""The universities in the middle will really have to think about their proposition,"" she says. Google economics Professor Koller says Coursera will keep its content free by following the Silicon Valley approach of companies such as Google. With large numbers of motivated, employable students - so far about 600,000 and rising - there are going to be plenty of opportunities and partnerships for revenue streams. The online projects are also aimed at meeting the huge international demand for higher education. In its initial stages, Coursera has acquired students in 190 countries. Outside the US, the biggest numbers are in the UK, Brazil, Russia and India. ""This is a real democratising influence, making a profound change. It will tap into unused talent,"" says Professor Koller. ""Technology has got to the point where it's feasible. We shouldn't stratify society by who can afford access to education."" Earlier this week, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it was giving $1m to MIT to use edX courses in partnership with colleges serving low-income students - which raises an intriguing possibility of bringing high-quality resources where they are most needed. Of course there have already been online degrees and courses. The UK's Open University has been a trailblazing pioneer of such distance learning. Stanford has also been experimenting. In the US, large numbers of students have taken for-profit online degrees aimed at those unable to access campus-based courses. But so far online projects have been in counterpoint to the mainstream. Into the mainstream The entry of such giants such as Harvard, Stanford and MIT means that it is coming into the centreground. It is also a development that coincides with the growing accessibility of high-quality online video and devices such as iPads and smartphones. There are already rich seams of free educational material online - such as on iTunes U - and this is increasingly being structured into something more formal. But there are also warnings against under-estimating the challenges. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, says universities have been experimenting with teaching online for a decade, but ""it's not there yet"". ""It's much harder than teaching a class face-to-face,"" he says. It's good that institutions such as MIT and Harvard are putting their shoulder to the wheel, he says, but so far no one has really worked out how to harness the internet for a university degree course. Moral purpose Professor Dutton also warns that the funding model of edX - subsidised by two very wealthy institutions - is not going to be affordable by many other universities. But the idea of open learning has its own ""moral purpose"", says Anka Mulder, head of Delft University in the Netherlands. Dr Mulder is president of the OpenCourseWare group which advocates free online course materials. The demand for higher education is growing, both in the developed and developing countries and Dr Mulder says it ""can't be achieved by building universities"". She also argues that scepticism about whether courses can be delivered online - and worries about a lack of interaction - is being overtaken by changing social habits. Talking and sharing online is no longer such a leap of the imagination. ""For the younger generation, the gap between online and real life is blurred,"" she says. Dr Mulder says that in five years most universities will be incorporating online learning in some form. ""Open learning is a movement that isn't going to go away,"" she says.",This autumn more than a million students are going to take part in an experiment that could re-invent the landscape of higher education.
"Official data showed GDP rose 1.5% in the January-to-March period, against a revised 0.1% in the prior quarter. The figure beat forecasts for 1% growth, and was led by consumer spending which rose by 2.1%. Capital spending by businesses also outperformed, rising by 4.9%, which was more than double analyst expectations. Private consumption accounts for about 60% of Japan's economy. However, economists warned that spending may taper off now that the April tax hike has been introduced. ""Japan's economy expanded rapidly ahead of the sales tax hike, but is set to slump thereafter,"" Marcel Thieliant, Japan economist at Capital Economics, said. ""Looking ahead, the economy will certainly contract in the second quarter of the year, as consumers rein in spending after the tax hike, and residential investment is set to plunge."" Trade deficit Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying to revive growth in the world's third-largest economy. His policy of ""Abenomics"" has helped Japan's economy grow faster, but concerns remain about whether the recovery is durable. Analysts warn that Japan's huge trade deficit could pose a risk to growth. Data released on Monday showed that exports grew 6% quarter-on-quarter as a weaker yen made Japanese goods cheaper to overseas buyers. However, the weaker currency has also made imports more expensive for Japan, which has continued to buy vast quantities of foreign fuel to compensate for its lack of nuclear power. Bill Adams, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group, also expects an economic contraction in the second quarter. ""Japan's imports continued to grow faster than exports in the first quarter, as they have in each of the preceding two quarters,"" he said. ""Abenomics has boosted Japanese import demand more than the weaker yen is boosting Japan's exports.""",Japan's economy grew at the fastest pace in nearly three years in the first quarter due to increased spending ahead of a sales tax increase on 1 April.

Getting her nails and eyebrows done are out too. And the luxury of popping to the supermarket for a trolley-full like they used to strikes Siobhan as ""a bit frivolous"" now. ""We're more savvy with our shopping. Instead of Tesco and Morrisons, we'll go to Aldi and Lidl or the market to get better deals,"" she says. Households across the UK are tightening their belts as the economic consequences of the pandemic eat into incomes. And Blackpool, where Siobhan, 30, and Steve, 37, live, is one of the worst-hit areas. Since March the numbers looking for work in Blackpool have doubled to around 12% of the local population while job vacancies have fallen by more than a third. Incomes in Blackpool were already lower than almost anywhere else in the UK before the pandemic, meaning people are less likely to have savings to fall back on or friends and family in a position to help them out. Nevertheless, Siobhan and Steve are just managing to keep on top of things by taking payment holidays on their car finance and credit cards. Others haven't been so fortunate. The government moved quickly in March to help protect incomes, increasing universal credit by £20 a week, launching loan schemes for the self-employed and paying businesses to put staff on furlough. But within that there remained a wide range of experiences. Furloughed workers took home on average 13% less than before, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. But those who lost their jobs and moved on to universal credit saw their incomes fall by an average of 40%. A survey released this week by the Financial Conduct Authority suggested that ""12 million people in the UK had low financial resilience, meaning they may struggle with bills or loan repayments"". It suggested that almost a third of adults have seen a drop in income, with households seeing income fall by a quarter, on average. Rezia, 37, who lives in central London, estimates her family is living on around a half of what they had before the pandemic hit, after her husband lost his job as a carer in March. They are relying on the maintenance loan she gets as a full-time student, while he tries to earn some money ""Ubering"". But London is still very quiet and business is slow. Residents of the UK's biggest cities have been hit particularly hard as offices emptied out and the entertainment industry shut down. ""We're trying to stick to a budget,"" Rezia says. ""It's a massive change. No more treats, less snacks, and for meat, usually in an Asian household you do a monthly shop and put it in the freezer. Now we just go to the shop and get a little bit."" Rezia's daughters have learned not to ask for toys, magazines and chocolate. The only concessions: she has kept her car and her husband has kept his gym membership. The biggest change is to their social lives, Rezia says. ""Before we would go to restaurants, have takeaways, go shopping for presents. We used to go to my mum's house with cakes and treats and take her out for coffee or shopping."" At Eid she says the four of them had a picnic in St James's Park instead of the big family celebration that would have been more typical. Siobhan and Rezia's belt-tightening illustrates one half of the parallel narratives affecting overall spending, says Dave Innes, chief economist at poverty campaign group, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. ""We have a striking contrast,"" he says. ""If you were someone towards the bottom of the income distribution you're more likely to have had a difficult experience,"" he says. ""People in the middle or top of the income distribution have been more likely to continue working from home and during lockdown built up savings, and generally are a lot less likely to be in a bad financial position."" Of course some better-off individuals are the ones who have seen the most dramatic falls in income, if they lost well-paid jobs or had to close their businesses. But they are also more likely to have assets to fall back on, says Mr Innes. Donia Youssef, for instance, has seen her business Tiny Angels, a modelling and casting agency for children based in London, grind to a standstill with no prospect of reopening for the foreseeable future. She has taken her young children out of private school, cancelled holidays and sold cars. ""It has just put huge pressure on us, so I said to the family let's reroute and rent out this house or sell it and go to St Lucia,"" she says. Her husband, who has just been laid off from his job, is from St Lucia and Donia can pursue her other business interests in publishing and film almost as easily from there as here. ""We said let's try it for a year. There's nothing to lose. If it doesn't work we've got rentals in the UK we can live off,"" she says. Aisling and Jamie Lord, both 40, aren't quite so fortunate. They both lost their jobs and are now claiming universal credit, about £1,000 a month. Before this summer, they took home eight times that between them, through her work in human resources, and his as a customer experience manager. They've cancelled the children's football clubs, maths tutors, swimming lessons and cut out having wine with dinner. Instead of buying Halloween decorations they'll be making them out of whatever is in the recycling box. ""A treat before would have been going to a toy store. We wouldn't have blinked an eye if [our daughter] had picked up a doll for £25. Today a treat is a chocolate lollipop,"" says Aisling. Despite cutting back on everything they can think of their outgoings are more than their income every month, but luckily, they had savings to fall back on. Moreover they live in a part of the country, just west of London, where they are hopeful they'll be able to find new jobs thanks to flourishing pharmaceutical and technology industries. But even when they are back in work, they aren't planning to return to their pre-pandemic spending habits. ""To be honest it's been a great financial lesson. It has made us make our pennies go a lot further,"" says Aisling. Now she says they're actually a bit frightened of spending again. ""We just need to get money and save for the next rainy day. The world has broken once and will break again. We need to hold on to our money.""","Siobhan Walker has worked seven days a week for the last six weeks, and there's still no day off on the horizon."
"In the three months to the end of September, Tata made net profits of 18.77bn rupees ($372.9m; £234.5m), as against 22.23bn rupees a year earlier.

"By Bill WilsonBusiness reporter, BBC News And off the field there is a new confidence, with a new four-year sponsorship deal with mobile phone operator O2 under the Rugby Football Union's belt. Sport industry insiders say the partnership is worth between £25m to £30m to the RFU over the life of the agreement. English rugby's governing body had a testing 2011, riven by internal strife which saw three chief executives at the helm during the year and a poor World Cup which resulted in the departure of team manager Martin Johnson. However, the RFU and O2, in renewing their partnership, hope that 2012 can herald a new start for English rugby. The Six Nations opening match win over Scotland came after another commercial partnership was agreed, signed in January with Lucozade maker GSK. The O2 deal will run beyond the 2015 Rugby World Cup, which is being held in England. The mobile phone operator and RFU are hoping that the event will give a much-needed boost to the sport. 'Grass roots' vision ""This is a very important announcement with O2, a firm we have been working with for over 16 years,"" says RFU acting chief executive Steve Brown. ""It is about working directly with the grass roots as much as the professional side of the game. ""It is also good to have this on top of the result last weekend. It is a start, a pointer in the right direction. ""We [the RFU] have been having discussions over the past months, about moving in a new and positive direction."" Mr Brown is the RFU's chief financial officer, but has been working as acting boss since November, and will remain in that role until former All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club chief Ian Ritchie takes over as chief executive in late February. The RFU says rugby union is the fastest-growing sport in England, and as well as the World Cup boost, Rugby Sevens will be part of the Rio Olympics schedule in 2016. And as part of its renewed deal with O2, as with the GSK partnership, there is an enhanced emphasis on reaching out to grass-roots rugby. To that end, O2 will continue its involvement with the RFU's grassroots rugby programmes, building on past campaigns including O2-supported beach and touch-rugby events, with the aim of ""making rugby even more accessible to all"". The RFU's chief commercial officer, Sophie Goldschmidt, says that any new sponsorship deals it signs must enhance the experience of rugby-going fans, something it hopes the new O2 deal will provide through delivering rugby content on various digital platforms. Past offerings for O2 customers have included providing behind-the-scenes footage to smartphone owners of the England players' activities while off-duty. 'Icing on the cake' The RFU's previous deal with O2 was reported to be worth about £4m a year. O2 chief executive Ronan Dunne admits that ""this is an enhanced deal, bigger than previously"". The increased revenues will be useful for the RFU, which will see its income from matches at Twickenham this financial year come in well below those of last year, with just two home Six Nations matches and no autumn 2011 Test series. Those enhanced financial terms seen in the new deal are to reflect the expected surge in marketing opportunities around the 2015 World Cup, and what the RFU hopes will be an growing interest in rugby union. Mr Dunne agrees that having the World Cup in England during the life of the new deal is the ""icing on the cake"". He said O2 was looking for ""interactive opportunities"" in the run-up to the tournament and not merely to plaster its logo wherever it could. 'Value' Meanwhile, Mr Dunne played down the bad publicity both on and off the field last year for the RFU. ""Any business when it enters into a sponsorship relationship, they always consider who they are doing business with, "" says Mr Dunne. ""With recent arrivals on the executive team at the RFU, we looked at our next four years and to see if we could deliver value for O2 and our customers, and the answer was 'yes'."" He adds: ""Our focus was very much looking forward rather than looking back. We are confident we can add value to one another."" Now England caretaker coach Stuart Lancaster and his revamped playing team are also hoping to take a big step forward with victory over Italy in Rome at the weekend.","When England's rugby union team take the field at the Stadio Olimpico to play Italy on Saturday, they will do so with an extra spring in their step following their Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland."
"Of the 108,000 retail jobs lost to automation and ecommerce, 70% were among female employees, it found. The think tank also said that regions outside London were disproportionately affected by the retail downturn. The RSA said new jobs could be created, however, if retailers offered more ""experiential"" shopping. ""Our research shows that the economic pain that comes with the decline of the High Street is not being felt evenly,"" said Fabian Wallace-Stephens, one of the report's authors. The UK's High Streets have come under pressure from the rise of online shopping, high business rates in some parts of the country, and the squeeze on incomes during the years since the financial crisis. The pace of shop closures rose in the first half of 2019, with about 16 shops closing every day. However the North East and East Midlands saw an 11% drop in the retail workforce, while London had a 16% increase, according to the RSA's report. The RSA's study covered the years from 2011 to 2018, and found that 40,000 new warehouse and distribution jobs had been created by online retailers, but three quarters of those roles had been taken by men. ""As ever more people are shopping online, and businesses are introducing automated technology like self-service checkouts, this is changing the types of jobs available,"" said Fabian Wallace-Stephens, one of the report authors. ""Women are being hit particularly hard, with jobs growth being contained to roles usually filled by men such as delivery drivers. However, the High Street's decline could be reversed if retailers began offering more exciting in-store experiences, and customer service staff became more like ""in-store influencers"" he argued. An in-store ""influencer"" would provide a mixture of concierge and stylist roles at some retailers, or shop-floor workers in supermarkets providing nutrition or cooking demonstrations, said report co-author Alan Lockey. The RSA report also gave the example of the Lego store in Beijing, which it said felt like one of the Danish toy giant's theme parks. ""Many of these experiences cleverly utilise new technologies such as virtual reality to immerse customers in a world made of Lego, or to envisage what customers may look like as a Lego character,"" the think tank said. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said it was disappointing that job losses in retail had fallen hardest on women and less affluent regions. ""If the government wishes to support less affluent regions, it should reform the broken business rate system which holds back investment in physical space, and widens regional disparities,"" she said. Sophie Walker, chief executive of Young Women's Trust, said young women were losing out after being ""encouraged into the sector by sexist career advice and the need to find work that fits around the caring responsibilities they disproportionately shoulder"". Around one million young women are trapped in positions of no pay or low pay, she said. High Streets minister Jake Berry said the government was tackling the challenges facing the High Streets including putting £1bn into a Future High Streets Fund. ""We've slashed business rates by a third for many retailers - worth an estimated £1 billion - bringing the total amount of business rate support to over £13 billion and ensuring our High Streets are fit for the future,"" the minister said.","Women have been hardest hit by the wave of job losses that has swept the retail industry since 2011, a study from the Royal Society of the Arts has found."
"Apple sued Qualcomm in January, accusing the company of overcharging for its patented technology. Qualcomm said on Friday it would defend its right to receive ""fair value"" for its ""technological contributions"". The licence agreements had been in place for a decade, it said. ""These licence agreements remain valid and enforceable,"" Don Rosenberg, executive vice president and general counsel of Qualcomm, said. Qualcomm's share price dropped 3% following the latest update, which came less than two weeks after the company reported quarterly earnings. Qualcomm said its forecast at that time involved scenarios with reduced payments - not their complete absence. Qualcomm derived 40% of its revenue from Apple and Samsung Electronics in its most recent financial year. In a statement, Apple said: ""Without an agreed-upon rate to determine how much is owed, we have suspended payments until the correct amount can be determined by the court."" Apple's legal action in January followed a complaint by the Federal Trade Commission, a US regulator, alleging Qualcomm had used ""anticompetitive practices"" to maintain a monopoly over key technology. Apple has also sued Qualcomm in China and in the UK.","Qualcomm, the largest maker of mobile phone chips, has cut its profit forecast, warning investors that Apple is withholding royalty payments amid a legal battle."
"By Kevin CoreYou and Yours, Radio 4 Companies revealed on the ICO website include British Gas, Scottish Power, Talk Talk, Weatherseal Home Improvements, The Claims Guys, We Fight Any Claim and Anglian Windows. The ICO can issue fines of up to £500,000 for breaches of regulations on unwanted calls, texts and emails. The companies named said they were working with the ICO. The list was compiled from complaints to the authority and the Telephone Preference Service. The ICO said it expected to see improvements in their operations in the coming months. Three more companies, which have not been named, are being investigated by the ICO. Speaking to Radio 4's You & Yours, Simon Entwistle, the director of operations at the ICO, said that while companies often maintained that they had permission to contact customers directly, separate consent must exist for marketing calls. He added that there was no action they could take about calls which were made to chase a debt. ""We start off by working with the organisations because some of these big companies like British Gas and Talk Talk want to get this right but clearly there are problems,"" he said. ""We talk to them about how they can get it right and where we see in their system that something is going wrong. ""There is another category of organisation that only pay lip service to the regulations, what they want to do is to make as many calls as possible and try and get away with it. ""With those we take a very different approach, we have not named those organisations because we are actively gathering evidence in order to fine them for flouting the regulations as opposed to working and helping people who actually want to get it right."" Highest standards A spokesman for British Gas said: ""We uphold the highest standards when contacting people in their homes, and only use contact information if we have express permission to do so."" Scottish Power said it was working with the ICO. Talk Talk said complaints had fallen, it was not facing enforcement action and was working with the ICO. We Fight Any Claim said its data was provided by an external company and if numbers listed on the Telephone Preference Service slipped through they were immediately blocked. Anglian Windows said it took complaints seriously. Weatherseal Home Improvements confirmed it had been contacted by the ICO and was co-operating.

"Neil Parish, chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, said small suppliers would suffer from their pledge to cut 10% off the price of ""everyday"" items after they merge. Asda chief executive Roger Burnley and Sainsbury's Mike Coupe were giving evidence. Asda and Sainsbury's announced £15bn merger plans in April. ""You can't have a 10% saving without someone paying for it,"" Mr Parish said. Both Mr Burnley and Mr Coupe said that small suppliers would not be hurt by their attempt to cut the price of every day items such as milk, bread and tinned tomatoes. ""I can categorically say that the synergy benefits on which the combination is predicated are not based on making 10% savings from individual suppliers as you're saying,"" Mr Burnley said. Mr Parish questioned the assertions by the two supermarkets that the enlarged business - which will have 300,000 staff and 2,800 stores - would have a 25% market share, rather than 30%. MPs on the committee also questioned whether the two brands would remain separate, as the companies have announced, after the deal takes place next year. 'Mickey Mouse' figures ""We're not children, you can't just come in here and give us a nursery rhyme,"" said Mr Parish. ""We've being having lots of Mickey Mouse figures this morning,"" he said. Savings on everyday products could come from larger suppliers, Mr Coupe told MPs, not from smaller ones. Mr Coupe gave the example of cereal company Weetabix, which is owned by US company Post. ""Weetabix make 20p in the pound profit and we don't think it's an unreasonable question to ask Weetabix to take the buying price that's currently paid by Sainsbury's or Asda and make it the same for both companies."" That saving would be passed on to consumers, Mr Coupe said. Mr Parish further questioned whether the enlarged company would have such clout with major companies, citing the example of the largest chain, Tesco. ""It is not believable that it is only the big suppliers,"" he said. ""They are bigger than you, and they are bigger than your combined operations."" Mr Coupe said suppliers had told him that they saw benefits of dealing with a company like Sainsbury's. He told MPs that his pay was not linked to the deal taking place. He has already apologised for being caught on camera singing ""We're in the money"" while waiting to be interviewed for ITV News on the day the deal was announced. The deal is subject to scrutiny by the Competition and Markets Authority and Mr Coupe said it was possible that the regulator could require stores to be closed. He was not specific about how many stores overlapped. The BBC has reported that up to 73 stores could have to be sold.","MPs have accused the heads of Asda and Sainsbury's of talking ""baloney"" about the impact of their merger."
"By Julia CaesarBusiness reporter, BBC News Retailers in the US are gearing up for Thanksgiving. In Europe they are getting ready for Christmas. They do this every year, obviously, but this year consumers are expected to spend much more than they did a year ago, so demand for container ships has soared. Last year, ocean shippers lost an estimated $15bn (£10bn). This year they are making money again. With a vengeance. The world's largest container shipping firm, AP Moller-Maersk Group, recently raised its predictions for this year's bonanza, forecasting earnings in excess of the $3.5bn profits it clocked up in 2008. But growth in demand only makes up half the explanation for Maersk's success, according to industry observers. ""It's partly because there's extra demand for the services,"" says Michelle Wiese Bockmann, markets editor at Lloyd's List. ""But there's this concept of slow steaming, which is seeing the lines slow down the speed of their ships from say 18 - 20 knots, which is quite fast, down to 12 knots. Slowing down helps the freighters cut fuel consumption, and thus costs. The practise also adds an extra day or two to the ships ocean transit, so extra ships are taken out of dock in order to maintain weekly service schedules. This in turn has created greater demand for ships that would otherwise have laid idle. So these days, Maersk makes sure all or most of its ships are filled to the brim when they leave dock, further squeezing costs. Retailers return Maersk has also done what many successful companies do during recession: the company has expanded its fleet ahead of an upturn in both demand and prices - a recovery that some in the industry say was entirely predictable. This year, Maersk has more ships back at sea than at any other time during the last year. ""When you look at what the rates were doing in 2009, they were not only historically low, but extraordinarily bad,"" says Ms Bockmann. ""Nobody would really expect rates to be sustained at that level at all."" Last year's slump in rates saw many shipping companies reduce their fleet, responding to the fall in demand from retailers that cut back on imports. Globally, the container fleet was reduced by about 10%. But now, with stock levels low and strong demand on the horizon, retailers are yet again eager to re-stock their shelves. Extraordinary turnaround To make sure they get their goods in time for Thanksgiving and Christmas, they are outbidding each other to secure cargo space. In doing so, they are pushing up freight rates, so some are now paying more than double the rate they paid last year. The Hong Kong to Los Angeles rate for a 40ft container is now $2,624, compared with $870 about 12 months ago. And though a recovery in rates was expected, the scale of the increase has come as a surprise. ""The fact that we are now talking about [Maersk] making profits in the second quarter is just an extraordinarily amazing turnaround that nobody could have even predicted back in December,"" says Ms Bockmann. There are no guarantees that the good times will last, however. Though international trade is expected to grow sharply this year compared with 2009, there are still widespread fears of a double-dip recession.",This is the busiest period in the shipping calendar.
"That takes the total number of cars GM has recalled this year to over 13 million in the US - more than the carmaker sold in 2013. The latest move covers possible faulty seat belts, transmissions, and air bags, as well as potential fire issues. No fatalities have been associated with this recall. Most of the vehicles affected by the latest recalls were built between 2004 and 2010, although a small number of new cars and pickup trucks have also been included. Mounting pressure The company has been under intense pressure recently from regulators to improve its safety standards. Last week the company was fined $35m (£21m) for failing to address different defects which have been linked to 13 deaths. That was the maximum allowed by US law and it was the single highest civil penalty ever levied as a result of a recall investigation. The recalls have already cost the company $1.3bn in the first three months of the year and it now estimates it will cost the firm around $400m in the April to May period. It expects an internal investigation about the issue to conclude within the next two weeks. Shares were down more than 3%.",US car giant General Motors has announced it will recall another 2.4 million vehicles in the US because of safety concerns.
"By Mark BroadBusiness reporter, BBC News During the course of the 9-week trial, the 35-year-old trader was portrayed by the prosecution as the ""ringmaster"" in a global conspiracy, but by the defence as a minor player who was ""thrown under a bus"" by his bank employers. In the end the jury believed the prosecution counsel. So who is the man, nicknamed ""the Rainman"" by his colleagues, now convicted with conspiracy to manipulate one of the world's most important financial benchmark rates? Money maker Mr Hayes said he never had any great ambitions to go into the world of high finance. Having spent his university summer holidays working in a restaurant kitchen, he decided that once he graduated he wanted to earn a bit more money than he earned cleaning out deep fat fryers and de-boning chicken. Hayes gained a degree in maths and engineering from Nottingham University - just two years before Kweko Adeboli, the UBS trader jailed for unauthorised trades which cost the bank £1.4bn. My managers knew, my manager's manager knew. In some cases the CEO [chief executive] was aware of it Hayes' natural ability with numbers was enough to impress the recruiters at RBS, who offered him a place on their graduate trainee scheme in 2001. There he had his first introduction to the workings of the financial markets, before moving on to Royal Bank of Canada and then to UBS in September 2006. Scapegoat? It was at the UBS office in Tokyo that he started trading a financial product based on the Libor rate. Libor: What is it and why does it matter? Mr Hayes didn't deny that while at UBS, and subsequently at Citibank, he attempted to manipulate the Libor rate. Or that the conversations in online chatrooms and the bank's internal messaging system, that were used in evidence, were genuine. But when the court heard that he was colluding to set the Libor rate to his own advantage, his response was that manipulating Libor was common practice at the banks where he worked and that his superiors were aware of what he was doing. He argued he was being made the scapegoat for wrongdoing when in reality many others had been involved long before he started in the industry. None of that contradicts the prosecution's claims that he was an ""extremely intelligent man"" who used his gift for numbers to make huge profits for his employers- and in return received considerable remuneration. 'Frozen with fear' Mr Hayes was paid £1.3m for just over three years' work at UBS, but he became frustrated believing the bank was reneging on a deal on his pay. He left to take up a similar position at Citi where he was then paid £3.5m for the nine months he worked there, before being sacked in September 2010 over allegations of manipulating the Libor rate. Mr Hayes then returned to the UK and handed himself into the Serious Fraud Office. He told the court that he was ""frozen with fear"" at the possibility he would be charged by the US authorities, saying he thought he could be jailed for decades. He ended up giving over 80 hours of recorded interviews to the SFO in which he admitted to his part in trying to manipulate the Libor rate. ""I mean I probably deserve to be sitting here because, you know, I made concerted efforts to influence Libor,"" Mr Hayes told the SFO. ""Although I was operating within a system or participating within a system in which it was commonplace, you know, ultimately I was someone who was a serial offender."" Mars bar deal Having made the confession he subsequently pulled out of the SFO process and decided to fight the legal proceedings against him. He told the court that he felt more confident having his fate decided by 12 jurors than in what he called a 'politically driven process' brought by the SFO. Hayes has had to fight against a huge weight of evidence showing Bloomberg instant messaging chats and other online exchanges which appeared to incriminate him. In one chat he told an RBS trader: ""Three-month Libor is too high, 'cos I've kept it artificially high"". He explained he was able to do this by being 'mates' with traders at another bank. In a phone call played to the court he offered 'a humungous deal' of $50,000 to $100,000 if his contact kept his Libor submission at a particular rate. But another time he suggested a mars bar was enough to persuade other traders to help fix the rate. Who knew? The judge told the jury that Mr Hayes had been diagnosed with a ""mild"" form of Asperger's syndrome, which meant that he saw issues in black and white rather than shades of grey. During his evidence Hayes insisted he did not know or think he was doing anything dishonest as the activities were so common within the industry. Mr Hayes told the court that he did not always fit in with his bank colleagues who nicknamed him ""Tommy chocolate"" due to his enthusiasm for drinking hot chocolate while others drank beer at social events. He also said that his colleagues would mock him for keeping a childhood superhero duvet cover well into his adult life. While on the stand Mr Hayes was keen to portray himself as part of wider system of wrongdoing in the banking system. ""I acted with complete transparency to my employers. My managers knew, my manager's manager knew. In some cases the CEO [chief executive] was aware of it,"" Mr Hayes told the court. He denied that what he was doing was ""clandestine"" and said that he made no attempts to ""cover his tracks"", even posting on Facebook about his Libor related trades. During the trial, Mr Hayes talked about how hard the legal process had been for his wife and young child. He told the jury that he had found it hard not being able to work in the financial services sector since his arrest and that although he had studied for an MBA, he did not think he had been very good at it. While the court case has put him firmly in the spotlight, there are other Libor trials to follow. The SFO has charged 11 others over Libor rigging, having received special funding from the Treasury to pursue prosecutions. For now Tom Hayes is the only individual to take the rap for his part in one of the most shameful episodes in financial history.",Tom Hayes is the first individual to be convicted in the Libor fixing scandal and has been sentenced to 14 years in prison.
"Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased by 0.7%, up from 0.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The upward revision is mainly due to manufacturing industry having done better than thought. The ONS cut its estimate for growth in 2016 as a whole to 1.8%, down from the 2% it forecast last month. This downward revision pushes UK slightly below Germany, with an estimate of 1.9%, in the G7 growth league, said John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, ""though the difference is well within the margin of error on any such early GDP estimates."" The downward revision appeared to have been prompted by weaker North Sea oil and gas production during the first six months of 2016, and did not reflect the underlying strength of the UK economy, he added. ""Excluding oil and gas output, estimated UK GDP growth might actually have been revised up in 2016,"" added Mr Hawksworth. The third revision of the figures will be on 31 March, after the Budget on 8 March. ""Unfortunately, this means that the chancellor won't be able to say that the UK was the fastest-growing G7 economy in 2016 in his upcoming Budget - Germany grew by 1.9%,"" said Capital Economics UK economist Paul Hollingsworth. Brexit 'uncertainty' The ONS also said there had been a slowdown in business investment, which fell by 1% compared with the three months to the end of September. It attributes that to ""subdued growth"" in investment in information and communications technology equipment, as well as ""other machinery and equipment"". Shilen Shah, a bond strategist at Investec Wealth & Investment, said: ""Somewhat disappointingly, business investment fell on the quarter, with hints that Brexit uncertainty is hitting business confidence."" However, the dominant services sector continued to grow steadily, ""due in part to continued growth in consumer spending, although retail showed some signs of weakness in the last couple of months of 2016, which has continued into January 2017,"" according to ONS head of GDP Darren Morgan. ""UK GDP may have gained some momentum into the end of 2016, but recent news from UK seems to have shown that that momentum has been lost in the early weeks of 2017,"" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at the international payments company, World First. ""Services growth is set to slow, buffeted by rising inflation and slowing real wage gains and a consumer that is not waving but drowning."" This was a point picked up by Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, who tweeted.

"By Andy VerityBBC Economics correspondent When the coronavirus crisis struck, Kim's work was cut off by the lockdown. But she has received nothing from government schemes designed to help support the self-employed. Kim, from Southsea in Portsmouth, is among millions shut out from help, many of whom could easily be included if the government chose to, research shows. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), which carried out its research for the BBC, concludes there is ""clear unfairness"" in some of the exclusions. The government said it had ""designed and provided one of the most generous self-employed income support schemes in the world"". The Treasury's position is that self-employment support has been targeted at lower earners and those most reliant on trading income, and that many people may be eligible for other government support. Kim, who is also a make-up artist, lost her husband David to cancer in November 2018, 'Build my dream' She refused to let her clients down, keeping up her work between visits to her husband David as he lay in hospital with a brain tumour. ""I don't think you can ever fully adjust to losing someone who's been in your life for so long. ""We did everything together; we had a good marriage. He was my best friend - he was a wonderful, wonderful man."" When he died Kim poured energy into her work, even as she grieved and supported her children, using money passed to her from David's pension scheme to redevelop The Beauty Shed, her business premises in the rear garden of her family home in Southsea. ""I had a little wooden shed and used that as my treatment room. It was always my dream to have something bigger that was purpose-built for everything I needed it to do. ""By using that pension to build my dream - and David's dream as well - was amazing because I know if he was here he would think: 'This is fantastic'."" In 2019 her business took off. ""In 2019 I did 54 weddings, travelling all over the south coast. It's a job I thoroughly enjoy doing - it's great to be part of someone's biggest day of their lives. But then in 2020 because of the pandemic it collapsed - I've only done four."" ""[Chancellor] Rishi Sunak stood up and said no-one would be forgotten. No one would be left behind. So I felt a massive sense of relief, because I could work, that my business would be looked after - which clearly it hasn't been because I've been excluded from any help."" Income rule ""Boris Johnson keeps saying the government's doing 'everything we can'. But they are not - they're just not."" When the pandemic struck in the spring of 2020, she was shocked to learn that the money from David's pension ruled her out of the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) treated it as income, and because it was slightly larger than her income from self-employment in 2018/19, she fell foul of a rule excluding people who earn less than 50% of their income from self-employment. ""I still can't get my head round the fact that a dead person's money can be seen as an income. My accountant couldn't explain it to me. The rule is supposed to stop people claiming because they have another job. So basically I'm being told my dead husband's pension money is another job."" HMRC estimates that 1.4 million people aren't eligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme because their income from self-employment is less than half of their overall income. 'No need for barriers' Many are ruled out because they top up modest pension incomes with part-time jobs or self-employment. Research body the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was ""clear unfairness"" in some of the exclusions. The IFS found 1.3 million people excluded by that rule could be included at a cost of less than £800m for three months. A further 225,000 people are excluded by a rule that means you are ineligible if you earn more than £50,000. They could also be included at a cost of £1.3bn over three months - or less if support was reduced for higher earners. That compares to around £90bn that the government expects to spend on furlough and self-employment. IFS director Paul Johnson told the Today programme that for some people, their self-employment pay ""is very small indeed, but for some its an important part of their income"" and that losing it all is ""creating serious hardship"". The money needed to support those excluded is ""a very small percentage of the self employment scheme itself and 1% of the self employment scheme and the furlough scheme together."" ""The Treasury have drawn a line, in a sense very generously for most, and then just put a complete cut off for other groups,"" he said. To extend it ""would be relatively cheap and it would certainly help some people who are clearly in significant trouble."" He told the BBC: ""It may be a minority but it's certainly left some people with real, big problems. If your income goes down from £55,000 to nothing through no fault of your own, you are clearly in big trouble,"" he said. Research by Standard Life Foundation suggests that 3.8 million adults have lost earnings because of anti-virus measures yet received nothing from either the furlough or the self-employed schemes. This includes those excluded from the self-employed schemes and those denied furlough and instead made redundant. Standard Life Foundation chief executive Mubin Haq said: ""At the start of the pandemic the Chancellor promised workers they would be supported. Millions have but far too many, who've worked hard and paid their taxes have been left high and dry. Too many are struggling to pay for food and everyday essentials."" Schemes 'under review' A Treasury spokesperson said: ""As the IFS acknowledge, the government has designed and provided one of the most generous self-employed income support schemes in the world which has helped nearly 3 million people claim almost £20bn pounds. ""The scheme is targeted to provide support to those most in need - lower earners and those that rely solely on their self-employment income. ""Many of those who do not qualify will benefit from other measure in our unprecedented £280bn package of support, such as furlough. ""We acknowledge that it has not been possible to support everyone in the way they might want, but we continue to work with stakeholders and keep our schemes under review.""

"Bank of England data showed that net lending fell £300m in the first quarter of 2013. Lending to individuals was up, but loans to businesses were down. The figures are an improvement on the last three months of 2012, when bank lending fell by £2.4bn. The Bank also said that banks taking part in FLS would make more loans available later this year. FLS was launched last August, in an attempt to boost lending and get the economy expanding. Under the scheme, banks and building societies are allowed to borrow money cheaply from the Bank of England, providing they loan that money to individuals or businesses. FLS was recently extended by a year, until January 2015. Pick up The Bank of England said that banks had borrowed an additional £2.6bn under the scheme in the first quarter, taking the total amount that has been made available so far to £16.5bn. When FLS was launched, the government said it expected that up to £70bn would eventually be made available. The Bank of England said Monday's figures showed that new lending was coming on stream, as old loans were phased out. ""The picture of flat lending growth overall is broadly as expected at this stage, reflecting reductions in some legacy portfolios being roughly offset in aggregate by expanding new lending,"" said Paul Fisher the Bank's executive director for markets. He said he expected new lending to pick up further through the rest of 2013. Some banks and building societies have increased their loans. Barclays and Nationwide were among the lenders to increase their loan book, while RBS, Santander and Lloyds reduced the amounts they lent. In a statement issued after the Bank of England's figures were released, RBS said it was ""punching above its weight"" in business lending. ""RBS has increased lending to the real economy by nearly £1bn in Q1 2013, which includes a £600m increase in our business lending - our strongest performance since the scheme launched,"" it said. Lloyds Banking Group said the reduction in its lending was as a result of running down the ""non-core"" parts of its business. HSBC has not taken part in FLS to date, preferring to finance loans from its own resources. 'Out in the cold' The Bank of England said the latest figures reflected the continuing trend of an improvement in lending to individuals, but a decline in lending to businesses. It said one reason for this was that some lenders had reduced their exposure to commercial property, which makes up a significant proportion of their lending. It also said that most of the reduction in loans was down to three big lenders (RBS, Lloyds and Santander) who were cutting back as a result of the financial crisis, or in order to qualify for state aid. But the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which represents over 100,000 businesses in the UK, expressed disappointment with the figures. ""It is a concern that lending continues to contract despite the Funding for Lending Scheme having been in place for nearly a year,"" said John Longworth, the BCC's director general. ""The real test for Funding for Lending is whether it is able to get credit flowing to young and fast-growing businesses. Unfortunately many of these growth firms are still being left out in the cold,"" he said. One example is an online estate agency, called hatched.co.uk, based at Hitchin in Hertfordshire. It applied for a bank loan of £60,000 last year, but was eventually given just £20,000. ""For me, the bank funding just isn't filtering through to small businesses like our own,"" said the company's managing director, Adam Day. ""And it's small businesses like ours which are going to help the economy grow,"" he said. The British Bankers Association (BBA) said many businesses do not want to borrow at the moment, often because they prefer to pay off debts first. ""Businesses currently have over £15bn of borrowing available that they are not using and are sitting on cash reserves of nearly £126bn almost 6% more than a year earlier,"" said Anthony Browne, the BBA's chief executive. ""As today's figures show, there should be no doubt that now is a good time for businesses to go and see their bank if they want to borrow. If you run a business with a good business plan and want funding, our message is apply to your bank,"" he said.","UK bank lending has continued to fall, despite government attempts to reverse the trend through its Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS)."
"Snapchat said it was asked by the Saudi authorities to remove the Qatari-backed broadcaster's Discover Publisher Channel because it violated local laws. Qatar is in an ongoing dispute with Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the UAE. The four countries cut ties with Qatar earlier this year, accusing the country of supporting terrorism. Saudi Arabia has one of the world's most restrictive media environments, according to human rights groups and media freedom advocates. But the Saudi authorities have a particular dislike for Al Jazeera. At one point they had demanded Qatar's government shut it down altogether as one of 13 conditions to remove sanctions against the country. Those conditions were later withdrawn. Saudi Arabia is one of the largest social media markets in the Middle East, boosted by a high rate of smart phone ownership. That can sometimes place US-listed companies like Snapchat's parent Snap Inc in an awkward position, as local laws are far more restrictive than in many other markets. ""We make an effort to comply with local laws in the countries where we operate,"" a Snapchat spokesperson said in a statement.",Social media platform Snapchat has blocked access to Al Jazeera content in Saudi Arabia.
"In early trading, the shares were down 2.5% before closing down 0.66% at $373.69. Mr Jobs, who has been on medical leave since 17 January, will stay on as Apple chairman. The new boss will be Tim Cook, formerly chief operating officer. Analysts suggested that the share price had not fallen further as investors had confidence in Mr Cook and his team. Talented team ""In our view, Tim [Cook] is a tough but well-regarded leader who will continue to hold Apple employees to an extremely high standard of performance,"" said Richard Gardner at Citigroup. Mr Cook, 50, has already been in charge of the company's day-to-day running since January and took the helm in 2004 as Mr Jobs battled cancer and again in 2009 when Apple's co-founder received a liver transplant. He is credited with ensuring the efficiency of the firm's supply chain and delivering Apple's industry-beating profit margins. Terry Connelly, dean of the Ageno School of Business at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, said: ""A company is dependent on its ability to institutionalise... genius in the corporate DNA. ""Apple shows every sign of having done that. We will see that when we see how Cook responds to competitive pressure."" 'Rude health' Van Baker, an analyst at Gartner, said there was no reason for investors to panic. ""Apple will do just fine,"" he said. ""There are so many talented people there, and Steve's attention to detail is baked into the culture."" Brand research company Millward Brown said the Apple brand should remain unaffected. ""[Steve Jobs] has left the Apple brand in rude health so that the company is still poised for future growth,"" said Millward Brown director Peter Walshe. He added that Mr Jobs had left Apple with a clear direction ahead, a successor in place, and a unique ""creative"", ""fun"" and ""adventurous"" brand behind him. Looking ahead, Ben Wood, research director at technology analysts CCS Insight said Tim Cook had a huge pair of shoes to fill, adding: ""Steve Jobs has been a tremendous leader but no man is bigger than the company itself."" 'Roadmap intact' Earlier this month, Apple was briefly the world's most valuable by market capitalisation, overtaking oil company Exxon Mobil. In his resignation letter, Mr Jobs said: ""I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role."" The company has some big products on the horizon such as the iPhone 5 and the iPad 3. ""Steve is [still] going to be able to provide the input he would do as a chief executive,"" said Colin Gillis at BGC Financial. ""But Tim has been de facto chief executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The vision and the roadmap is intact."" Stephen Fry, a long time admirer of Mr Jobs, told BBC News, ""I don't think there is another human being on the planet who has been more influential in the last 30 years on the way culture has developed."" ""If I had said that 10 years ago you'd have thought I was completely insane."" One former employee, Dan Crow, who worked at Apple for four years, said staff at the firm would be feeling ""very sad"" and a ""sense of loss"". But he said the firm had ""a whole suite of people who will replace most, if not all, of what Steve brought to the company"". Mr Cook's well-regarded team includes marketing chief Philip Schiller, design overseer Jonathan Ive, and Scott Forstall, who supervises the iPhone software. Steve Jobs was famous for his charismatic presentation of new products, dressed in his trademark turtle neck and jeans. Marketing chief Philip Schiller has fronted some recent presentations in Mr Jobs' absence and he may continue to do so, rather than new chief executive Tim Cook, the BBC's technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones says.",Apple shares have fallen in New York following the resignation of chief executive and co-founder Steve Jobs.
"The Dubai Financial Market closed down 7%, while the Saudi exchange also lost 7% after Fitch ratings agency cut its outlook for the country. Last week, the Dow Jones in the US fell 6%, while the UK's FTSE 100 posted its biggest weekly loss this year of 5%. Investors are concerned about a slowdown in China and the knock-on effects for the global economy. Both France's Cac 40 and Germany's Dax indexes lost 7% of their value last week. In the Middle East, there is particular concern about low oil prices, which are down by more than a half this year and have been falling steadily since May, when Brent Crude stood at $68 a barrel. A barrel now costs $45. This is mainly due to an abundance of supply, in large part from from US shale oil producers, which are weakening OPEC's once dominant position in global oil markets. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates are all members of OPEC. Moods were further dampened by a report from Fitch which cut the agency's outlook on Saudi Arabia from ""stable"" to ""negative"". The move reflects concerns about the future of the country's finances, which are heavily dependent on revenues from exporting oil. These worries come against a backdrop of falling global stock markets, reflecting widespread fears about the pace of the slowdown in the Chinese economy. On Friday, figures from the world's second largest economy showed that factory activity in August shrank at its fastest pace in more than six years. The data triggered another sell-off in Chinese shares, which ended the day down more than 4%, and 12% on the week. Earlier this month, the country's central bank announced measures to devalue the country's currency, the yuan, seen widely as a move to help Chinese exports - a weaker yuan makes Chinese goods cheaper overseas. This came after official figures showed the country's economic growth continuing to slow. For the three months to the end of July, the economy grew by 7% compared with a year earlier - its slowest pace since 2009.",Stock markets in the Middle East have fallen sharply after a difficult week for all major global share indexes.
"By Lora JonesBusiness Reporter, BBC News It says that HM Treasury needs to do more to understand the scale of problem debt, and how it impacts people's lives. So what are consumers' options when it comes to borrowing, and how much is the average household debt? How does debt work? There are two major forms of debt when it comes to borrowing money: secured and unsecured. Secured debts are usually tied to an asset. A mortgage is an example of a secured debt - the mortgage loan is secured by the property, and the lender can repossess it if the borrower falls behind on their payments. Unsecured debt, such as a credit card, usually comes with higher interest rates. That is because the lender does not have any rights to tie the debt to an asset. If borrowers cannot make the payments, they might incur additional charges, or could be taken to court by a lender. Problem debt is defined as the inability to pay back debts or household bills. Which is the most common type of debt? Mortgages and credit card spending are the most popular forms of borrowing, according to the latest figures from banking trading body UK Finance. In July 2018, gross mortgage lending for the total UK market stood at £24.6bn, which was 7.6% higher than a year earlier. UK cardholders with cards issued by banks, building societies or non-bank credit providers spent £17.1bn in June 2018. The value of spending on cards issued by UK high street banks was £11.1bn in July - up 8.1% on the previous year. UK Finance said the increase in spending was down to higher retail sales because of the World Cup and the warm weather. Other types of borrowing include: New figures from the Bank of England show that credit unions are on the rise. The UK's credit union membership passed two million for the first time, in the first three months of 2018. What's the average debt? The average UK household debt (including mortgages) was £58,540 in June, according to financial charity The Money Charity. Overall in the UK, people owed nearly £1.6 trillion at the end of June 2018, up from £1.55tn a year ago. UK households saw their annual outgoings surpass their income for the first time in nearly 30 years in 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS says that consumers are borrowing more and saving less because the bank rate - which dictates returns on savings and the size of loan repayments - has been near a record low for the past decade. According to debt charity StepChange, the number of younger people seeking debt advice has been increasing in recent years. More than 619,000 people contacted the charity for advice in 2017 and most of them were under the age of 40. StepChange clients could fall into one or more of the above categories. Why are payday loans controversial? A payday lender usually offers loans for fewer than 30 days, without a long application process. Payday loans are short-term loans for small sums, designed to tide people over until they next get paid. Payday loan companies have been criticised by debt charities for charging high interest rates and one-off fees to vulnerable customers if they fail to repay their loans on time. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) decided to cap the cost of payday loans at 0.8% of the amount borrowed per day and impose a £15 limit on default charges from January 2015. It said that nobody should have to repay more than double the original amount borrowed. It also stressed that loans should only be made to people who were capable of repaying the money. What does the recent increase in interest rates mean for borrowers? The Bank of England raised interest rates from 0.5% to 0.75% in August, making financial conditions better for savers rather than borrowers. Those most affected would include people on a standard variable rate mortgage, whose monthly payment rates are not fixed. The increase could also lead to a rise on rates for other types of borrowing like personal loans and credit cards.

"China's Shuanghui International has agreed to pay cash for the Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which including debt, values the firm at $7.1bn. The deal will be the largest takeover of a US company by a Chinese rival. It also highlights the growing power of Chinese firms and their desire to secure global resources. However, rival bidders may emerge since Smithfield has another 30 days to hold talks with other interested parties. Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Foods, which is controlled by one of the country's richest men, says it considered bidding for the company. Food scandals Shuanghui's takeover bid is likely to be closely scrutinised by US regulators due to a series of Chinese food scandals, including the sale of tainted meat. In 2011, China's state broadcaster CCTV revealed that Shuanghui's pork products contained the banned chemical clenbuterol, which makes the meat leaner. However, one of China's most infamous foods scandals was in 2008, when six infants died and about 300,000 fell ill from tainted milk powder. It was later found to have contained melamine, an industrial chemical. As a result of these scandals, there is increased demand among Chinese consumers for foreign food brands, which are viewed as a safer alternative to local products. Shaun Rein, founder of China Market Research says Hong Kong-based Shuanghui is making a 'very good' purchase given their brand suffered reputational damage from the clenbuterol scandal. ""Having that American label is going to build trust with consumers,"" he said. ""The number of pork imports grew 500% between 2010 and 2011. Despite the cooling economy in China, consumers are willing top pay premium on safe food."" 'Business as usual' Smithfield, which owns the Farmland, Armour and Healthy Ones brands, said the deal will allow the firm to expand the sale of its brands abroad. ""This is a great transaction for all Smithfield stakeholders, as well as for American farmers and US agriculture,"" Smithfield Chief Executive Larry Pope said in a statement. ""It will be business as usual - only better - at Smithfield. We do not anticipate any changes in how we do business operationally in the United States and throughout the world. We will become part of an enterprise that shares our belief in global opportunities and our commitment to the highest standards of product safety and quality."" Smithfield said it has accepted Shuanghui's bid of $34 per share for the company, which was more than a third higher than Tuesday's closing price. The deal is expected to close in the second half of the year, after which Smithfield's will also cease to be publicly traded.

Greece risks default and moving closer to a possible exit from the 19-member eurozone. The country is due to make a €1.6bn payment to the IMF on Tuesday - the same day that its current bailout expires. Last week, talks between Greece and the eurozone countries over bailout terms ended without an agreement, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras then called for a referendum on the issue to be held on 5 July. At the weekend, the Greek government confirmed that banks would be closed all week, after a decision by the European Central Bank not to extend emergency funding. Economist Daniel Martin from Capital Economics told the BBC the current situation was ""the closest Greece had come to exiting the eurozone"" and that it was likely to be a bad week for Asian markets. Greek banks are expected to stay shut until 7 July, two days after Greece's planned referendum on the terms it had been offered by international creditors for receiving fresh bailout money. China rate cut On Saturday, China's central bank cut its one-year lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.85%. It is the bank's fourth cut since November. It also lowered the amount of cash that some banks must hold as reserves by 50 basis points. Analysts said the moves highlighted Beijing's concerns that money was not flowing to some of the most-needed sectors in the economy.

"Wesfarmers bought the retailer in 2016 and is in the process of rebranding outlets as Bunnings - a popular chain in its home market. But the ""rapid repositioning"" hurt the bottom line, with profits down 86.6%. Earlier this month Wesfarmers said 40 Homebase stores could be closed, putting up to 2,000 jobs at risk.

But it added it was hopeful business would improve during the UK spring and summer. Trading worries The conglomerate, which also owns Australian supermarket giant Coles, posted profits of 212m Australian dollars (£119.3m; $166.8m) for the half, compared with A$1.6bn a year earlier. That decline was largely the result of a A$931m writedown at Homebase, which reflected rebranding and trading worries together with ""a moderated outlook"" for the business. Despite the profit slide, Wesfarmers' Sydney-listed shares finished up 3% as investors looked at signs of a recovery in the firm's core supermarket business in Australia.",The costs of overhauling UK DIY business Homebase contributed to a huge slump in profits for its Australian owner in the second half of last year.
"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News, Dubai Airshow The flamboyant chief executive of Qatar Airways has just been in a meeting with John Leahy, the chief operating officer of the European planemaker Airbus, and his mood is bullish. Mr Baker is ready to spend a whopping $6.4bn (£4bn) on new Airbus planes as part of a relentless and ambitious growth plan of a kind that has left many of its rivals shaking their heads. ""European carriers do not have the stomach to expand like us,"" Mr Baker says. ""But every downturn, every recession, gives people an opportunity to take advantage of the situation and this is exactly what Qatar is doing."" Bargaining position Leaning back in the wide, reclining first class seat in a lavishly kitted out Boeing 777, Mr Baker is clearly in a comfortable position. ""Oh, somebody's turned on the massage,"" he grins broadly. As far as Mr Baker is concerned, the current business environment is equally comfortable, not least because many rival airlines in Europe and the US are struggling to raise finance at a time when passenger traffic is down. ""In a way, it is good,"" he says, ""as it reduces capacity [in the industry]."" It also improves Mr Baker's bargaining position. Outside on the hot tarmac at the Dubai Airshow, expectations are high ahead of an anticipated announcement of the Airbus deal. But true to form, Mr Baker is ready to flex his negotiating muscle and add a bit of drama to the show. Apparently disgruntled about not being offered the first deliveries of Airbus's new A320neo planes, which will be up to 15% more fuel-efficient than its current A320 models, he walks out of afternoon talks, declaring that ""Airbus is still learning how to make aeroplanes"". ""We have cancelled the announcement,"" he says. ""There is an impasse. If this is resolved, fine. If not, bye-bye."" Lawyers blamed It turns out it is a temporary setback. As the afternoon moves towards evening and the temperature begins to drop, so the tempers cool down too. Soon the deal is back on as Mr Baker announces the purchase of five Airbus A380 aircraft that will double its fleet of the giant planes, as well as 50 orders for the A320neo, with an option for a further 30. Moreover, it now seems Qatar will be the first airline to get the A320neo, even though previously announced launch customer Virgin had been expected to be the favoured one. In a consolatory mood by now, Mr Baker blames the lawyers for the hiccup. ""Every deal sometimes gets stuck, especially when the lawyers throw spanners in the works,"" he says. It is tempting to think that Mr Baker knew all along that it would end well. After all, he need the planes to fulfil his ambitions. ""We are the best airline in the world, and we will keep on raising the bar,"" he says. ""We will keep on improving the product, we will grow and we will enter markets that people didn't expect us to serve."" Happy ending The Airbus deal immediately results in a string of side orders, with Pratt & Whitney landing a major engine contract for the A320neo, with further deals expected for suppliers of everything from seats and in-flight entertainment systems. The deal also helps Airbus's Mr Leahy finish the show on a high note, in the end having clocked up deals worth $17.6bn - just $900m short of arch-rival Boeing's orders during the week. ""Our A320neo has again been the star of the show,"" he declares as the event is coming to an end. ""Despite some storm clouds on the horizon, there is still strong market demand for fuel-efficient aircraft."" Perhaps it is obvious, but it is clear that Mr Baker is equally pleased. ""Ten years ago, they were laughing at us,"" he says, knowing full well that nobody does so anymore.","Speaking quietly into his ageing Nokia mobile phone, Akbar al-Baker, is busy finalising a major deal."

It was back in December 1989 that Florin and Mariuca were caught up in the Romanian revolution. ""We were on the streets while bullets and tear gas were around us,"" says Mariuca, who was 26 at the time. ""We had two twin boys, they were three then... I said to Florin I have to go home and take care of them."" Thankfully, they their sons were unharmed in the violent overthrow of the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his communist administration. But suddenly Mariuca and Florin, then 32, faced an uncertain economic future. As the state apparatus disintegrated, they were unsure if they would keep their jobs in the government's computer research institute; or if they did, whether they would be paid. So they both quit in January 1990 to set up their own company. In a country where private enterprise had been banned under the communists, neither of them had any experience of running a business, but they thought it was a risk worth taking despite some opposition within their families. Today their business, Bitdefender, is one of the world's most popular providers of cyber-security and anti-virus software. With annual revenues of more than $120m (£85m) the firm is valued at $600m. It was Mariuca's mother who opposed their decision to set up their own business 28 years ago in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. ""My mother was shouting 'are you crazy!',"" remembers Mariuca, 54. However, her father, a Romanian actor, gave the couple $300 to help get their venture off the ground. The early version of the business was called Softwin, and the idea was that it would offer software support services to companies in the West. Their first client came from France, and Florin admits that he and Mariuca had to learn the hard way that in the free market the customer had to be completely happy because he or she could simply go elsewhere - something that wasn't the case under communism because there wasn't any competition. ""We had to learn quickly what it means to have an unsatisfied client, and what to do in order to satisfy it,"" says Florin, now 60. ""Because we had come from the communist system which didn't necessarily put an accent on quality... it was like a cold shower."" Mariuca adds: ""It was a culture shock."" Thankfully for Florin and Mariuca and their team they were quick learners, and rather good at computing programming. Soon another Western firm got in touch to see if Softwin could fix a computer tennis game they were making. They were struggling to make the ball move fluidly. Florin says: ""We solved it the next night, and in two days we went to them with the solution."" Softwin continued to grow until 2001 when it morphed into the even more popular Bitdefender, with growth led by positive reviews and word-of-mouth recommendations as internet use proliferated around the world. Today, Bitdefender has 500 million customers (59% members of the public and 41% companies), who pay to download its software from its website. Mariuca admits that sometimes being Romanian has been a hindrance, because of the negative opinion some in the Western world have of the country. ""I think many Westerners thought we were coming out from the trees, being a poor country... uneducated."" But she adds that within the IT industry Romanians have an excellent reputation because there are a large number of Romanian computer specialists who have left the country to work abroad. Regarding Bitdefender's products, Florin says that it always has to work hard to make sure it stays ahead of the cyber-criminals. ""When we started, the attackers were activists or kids who wanted revenge. Nowadays it is organised crime. It is an industry; cyber-crime. ""People have all their devices connected to the internet, and all are like doors and windows for thieves."" Rik Turner, senior analyst at consultancy firm Ovum, says that Bitdefender has played a ""canny game"" by being in both consumer and business markets, and by ""doing licensing with other security vendors so that they can use its tech in their broader product portfolios"". On a day-to-day basis Florin, who holds the chief executive title, leads Bitdefender while Mariuca now looks after an educational software company called Intuitex. More The Boss features, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: The couple also make time for a hobby that they are passionate about - ballroom dancing. They are in fact national Romanian champions in their category. ""The dance lessons are us recharging,"" says Florin. Bitdefender now has 1,400 employs across offices in 11 countries and its headquarters in Bucharest. Some 40% of its business is in North America. While the business has a number of outside investors, Florin and Mariuca maintain a majority share. He says: ""In life and in business you are constantly experiencing, and you have to adapt quickly, you have to learn as quickly as possible, and be as agile as possible.""","As bullets whistled down the streets and tear gas swirled through the air like a toxic fog, Florin and Mariuca Talpes knew that their lives would never be the same again."
"The decision of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to leave rates at their new, historically low, level was no surprise. Last month the Bank halved its bank rate from 0.5% as it tried to ensure the stability of the UK's banking system in the aftermath of the June Brexit referendum vote. That was the first rate cut since 2009. But the Bank said again that it might cut rates further in the coming months, even though the immediate economic after-shock of the Brexit vote now appears to be weaker than first thought. ""A number of indicators of near-term economic activity have been somewhat stronger than expected,"" the Bank said in the minutes of its latest MPC meeting. It added that if its economic forecasts in November were similar to those it had formulated in August, then ""a majority of members expected to support a further cut in bank rate to its effective lower bound at one of the MPC's forthcoming meetings during the course of the year."" The Bank noted that a variety of economic indicators have suggested that the UK economy has shrugged off the post-referendum surprise in the short-term. As a result, the Bank is not as gloomy about the short-term state of the economy as it was a month ago. But it said that it still expects the pace of economic activity in the July-September period to have halved from the growth rate recorded earlier in the year. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor The Bank's internal judgement is that growth in Q3 (that's July to September) will now be between 0.2% and 0.3%, a pretty chunky upgrade on its August forecast of 0.1%. It's not an official forecast, but given the Q3 growth figure will be announced before the next meeting of the MPC in November, it is as close as we are going to get. Looking at 2017, the MPC says it is harder to make a judgement, but if the present economic momentum continues, then expect an upgrade in growth forecasts for next year and 2018 after brutal downgrades last month. It still says that is considering cutting interest rates again - to 0.1% - but the chances of that must be lower given the better economic news. Read Kamal's full analysis here Bond-buying Under a new timetable which replaces the long-standing practice of monthly meetings, the next MPC meeting will take place in November. It is at that point that some City economists expect a further cut in bank rate to just 0.1%. The latest vote of MPC members, who include the governor Mark Carney, was unanimous - at 9-0. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said: ""The Bank of England's decision to keep interest rates on hold was unsurprising. ""Although the post-referendum economic data has been decidedly mixed, we expect growth to slow sharply in 2017. ""We anticipate the MPC will move again to cut interest rates before the end of the year,"" he added. The MPC also voted to stick with the expansion of its quantitative easing (QE) policy, which it announced in August. That means the bank will now buy an extra £60bn of government bonds - taking the total to £435bn - along with a further £10bn of corporate bonds, as part of its continuing attempts to keep the economy from sliding into recession.",The Bank of England has left its main interest rate at 0.25% but says another cut is still a possibility.
"To join the currency, member states had to qualify by meeting the terms of the treaty in terms of budget deficits, inflation, interest rates and other monetary requirements. Of EU members at the time, the UK, Sweden and Denmark declined to join the currency. Since then, there have been many twists and turns for the countries that use the single currency. 1999 On 1 January, the currency officially comes into existence. 2001 Greece joins the euro. 2002 On 1 January, notes and coins are introduced. 2008 Malta and Cyprus join the euro, following Slovenia the previous year. In December, EU leaders agree on a 200bn-euro stimulus plan to help boost European growth following the global financial crisis. 2009 Slovakia joins the euro. Estonia, Denmark, Latvia and Lithuania join the Exchange Rate Mechanism to bring their currencies and monetary policy into line with the euro in preparation for joining. In April, the EU orders France, Spain, the Irish Republic and Greece to reduce their budget deficits - the difference between their spending and tax receipts. In October, amid much anger towards the previous government over corruption and spending, George Papandreou's Socialists win an emphatic snap general election victory in Greece. In November, concerns about some EU member states' debts start to grow following the Dubai sovereign debt crisis. In December, Greece admits that its debts have reached 300bn euros - the highest in modern history. Greece is burdened with debt amounting to 113% of GDP - nearly double the eurozone limit of 60%. Ratings agencies start to downgrade Greek bank and government debt. Mr Papandreou insists that his country is ""not about to default on its debts"". 2010 In January, an EU report condemns ""severe irregularities"" in Greek accounting procedures. Greece's budget deficit in 2009 is revised upwards to 12.7%, from 3.7%, and more than four times the maximum allowed by EU rules. The European Central Bank dismisses speculation that Greece will have to leave the EU. In February, Greece unveils a series of austerity measures aimed at curbing the deficit. Concern starts to build about all the heavily indebted countries in Europe - Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain. On 11 February, the EU promises to act over Greek debts and tells Greece to make further spending cuts. The austerity plans spark strikes and riots in the streets. In March, Mr Papandreou continues to insist that no bailout is needed. The euro continues to fall against the dollar and the pound. The eurozone and IMF agree a safety net of 22bn euros to help Greece - but no loans. In April, following worsening financial markets and more protests, eurozone countries agree to provide up to 30bn euros in emergency loans. Greek borrowing costs reach yet further record highs. The EU announces that the Greek deficit is even worse than thought after reviewing its accounts - 13.6% of GDP, not 12.7%. Finally, on 2 May, the eurozone members and the IMF agree a 110bn-euro bailout package to rescue Greece. The euro continues to fall and other EU member state debt starts to come under scrutiny, starting with the Republic of Ireland. In November, the EU and IMF agree to a bailout package to the Irish Republic totalling 85bn euros. The Irish Republic soon passes the toughest budget in the country's history. Amid growing speculation, the EU denies that Portugal will be next for a bailout. 2011 On 1 January, Estonia joins the euro, taking the number of countries with the single currency to 17. In February, eurozone finance ministers set up a permanent bailout fund, called the European Stability Mechanism, worth about 500bn euros. In April, Portugal admits it cannot deal with its finances itself and asks the EU for help. In May, the eurozone and the IMF approve a 78bn-euro bailout for Portugal. In June, eurozone ministers say Greece must impose new austerity measures before it gets the next tranche of its loan, without which the country will probably default on its enormous debts. Talk abounds that Greece will be forced to become the first country to leave the eurozone. In July, the Greek parliament votes in favour of a fresh round of drastic austerity measures, the EU approves the latest tranche of the Greek loan, worth 12bn euros. A second bailout for Greece is agreed. The eurozone agrees a comprehensive 109bn-euro ($155bn; £96.3bn) package designed to resolve the Greek crisis and prevent contagion among other European economies. In August, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warns that the sovereign debt crisis is spreading beyond the periphery of the eurozone. The yields on government bonds from Spain and Italy rise sharply - and Germany's falls to record lows - as investors demand huge returns to borrow. On 7 August, the European Central Bank says it will buy Italian and Spanish government bonds to try to bring down their borrowing costs, as concern grows that the debt crisis may spread to the larger economies of Italy and Spain. The G7 group of countries also says it is ""determined to react in a co-ordinated manner,"" in an attempt to reassure investors in the wake of massive falls on global stock markets. During September, Spain passes a constititional amendment to add in a ""golden rule,"" keeping future budget deficits to a strict limit. Italy passes a 50bn-euro austerity budget to balance the budget by 2013 after weeks of haggling in parliament. There is fierce public opposition to the measures - and several key measures were watered down. The European Commission predicts that economic growth in the eurozone will come ""to a virtual standstill"" in the second half of 2011, growing just 0.2% and putting more pressure on countries' budgets. Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos says his country has been ""blackmailed and humiliated"" and a ""scapegoat"" for the EU's incompetence. On 19 September, Greece holds ""productive and substantive"" talks with its international supporters, the European Central Bank, European Commission and IMF. The following day, Italy has its debt rating cut by Standard & Poor's, to A from A+. Italy says the move was influenced by ""political considerations"". That same day, in its World Economic Outlook, the IMF cuts growth forecasts and warns that countries are entering a 'dangerous new phase'. The gloomy mood continues on 22 September, with data showing that growth in the eurozone's private sector shrank for the first time in two years. The sense of urgency is heightened on 23 September, when IMF head Christine Lagarde urges countries to ""act now and act together"" to keep the path to economic recovery on track. On the same day, UK Prime Minister David Cameron calls for swift action on the debt crisis. The next day US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tells Europe to create a ""firewall"" around its problems to stop the crisis spreading. A meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington on 24 September leads to more calls for urgent action, but a lack of concrete proposals sparks further falls in share markets. After days of intense speculation that Greece will fail to meet its budget cut targets, there are signs of a eurozone rescue plan emerging to write down Greek debt and increase the size of the bloc's bailout fund. But when, on 28 September, European Union head Jose Manuel Barroso warns that the EU ""faces its greatest challenge"", there is a widespread view that the latest efforts to thrash out a deal have failed. The sense that events are spinning out of control are underlined by Foreign Secretary William Hague, who calls the euro a ""burning building with no exits"". On 4 October, Eurozone finance ministers delay a decision on giving Greece its next instalment of bailout cash, sending European shares down sharply. Speculation intensifies that European leaders are working on plans to recapitalise the banking system. On 6 October the Bank of England injects a further £75bn into the UK economy through quantitative easing, while the European Central Bank unveils emergency loans measures to help banks. Financial markets are bolstered by news on 8 October that the leaders of Germany and France have reached an accord on measures to help resolve the debt crisis. But without publication of any details, nervousness remains. Relief in the markets that the authorities will help the banking sector grows on 10 October, when struggling Franco-Belgian bank Dexia receives a huge bailout. On 10 October, an EU summit on the debt crisis is delayed by a week so that ministers can finalise plans that would allow Greece its next bailout money and bolster debt-laden banks. On 14 October G20 finance ministers meet in Paris to continue efforts to find a solution to the debt crisis in the eurozone. On 21 October eurozone finance ministers approve the next, 8bn euro ($11bn; £7bn), tranche of Greek bailout loans, potentially saving the country from default. On 26 October European leaders reach a ""three-pronged"" agreement described as vital to solve the region's huge debt crisis. After marathon talks in Brussels, the leaders say some private banks holding Greek debt have accepted a loss of 50%. Banks must also raise more capital to protect them against losses resulting from any future government defaults. On 9 December, after another round of talks in Brussels going through much of the night, French President Nicolas Sarkozy announces that eurozone countries and others will press ahead with an inter-governmental treaty enshrining new budgetary rules to tackle the crisis. Attempts to get all 27 EU countries to agree to treaty changes fail due to the objections of the UK and Hungary. The new accord is to be agreed by March 2012, Mr Sarkozy says. 2012 On 13 January, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgrades France and eight other eurozone countries, blaming the failure of eurozone leaders to deal with the debt crisis. Three days later, the agency also downgrades the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. Also on 13 January, talks between Greece and its private creditors over a debt write-off deal stall. The deal is necessary if Greece is to receive the bailout funds it needs to repay billions of euros of debt in March. The talks resume on 18 January. The ""fiscal pact"" agreed by the EU in December is signed at the end of January. The UK abstains, as does the Czech Republic, but the other 25 members sign up to new rules that make it harder to break budget deficits. Weeks of negotiations ensue between Greece, private lenders and the ""troika"" of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, as Greece tries to get a debt write-off and make even more spending cuts to get its second bailout. On 10 February, Greece's coalition government finally agrees to pass the demands made of it by international lenders. This leads to a new round of protests. But the eurozone effectively casts doubt on the Greeks' figures, saying Athens must find a further 325m euros in budget cuts to get the aid. On 12 February, Greece passes the unpopular austerity bill in parliament - two months before a general election. Coalition parties expelled more than 40 deputies for failing to back the bill. On February 22, a Markit survey reports that the eurozone service sector has shrunk unexpectedly, raising fears of a recession. The next day the European Commission predicts that the eurozone economy will contract by 0.3% in 2012. March begins with the news that the eurozone jobless rate has hit a new high. However, the economic news takes a turn for the better just days later with official figures showing that the eurozone's retail sales increased unexpectedly in January by 0.3%, and the OECD reports its view that the region is showing tentative signs of recovery. On 13 March, the eurozone finally backs a second Greek bailout of 130bn euros. IMF backing was also required and was later given. The month ends with a call from the OECD for the eurozone rescue fund to be doubled to 1tn euros. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel says she would favour only a temporary boost to its firepower. On 12 April, Italian borrowing costs increase in a sign of fresh concerns among investors about the country's ability to reduce its high levels of debt. In an auction of three-year bonds, Italy pays an interest rate of 3.89%, up from 2.76% in a sale of similar bonds the previous month. Attention shifted to Spain the next day, with shares hit by worries over the country's economy and the Spanish government's 10-year cost of borrowing rose back towards 6% - a sign of fear over the country's creditworthiness. On 18 April, the Italian government cut its growth forecast for the economy in 2012. It was previously predicting that the economy would shrink by 0.4%, but is now forecasting a 1.2% contraction. On 19 April, there was some relief for Spain after it saw strong demand at an auction of its debt, even though some borrowing costs rose. The 10-year bonds were sold at a yield of 5.743%, up from 5.403% when the bonds were last sold in February. On 6 May, a majority of Greeks vote in a general election for parties that reject the country's bailout agreement with the EU and International Monetary Fund. On 16 May, Greece announces new elections for 17 June after attempts to form a coalition government fail. On 25 May, Spain's fourth largest bank, Bankia, says it has asked the government for a bailout worth 19bn euros ($24bn; £15bn). On 9 June, after emergency talks Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos says that the country will shortly make a formal request for up to 100bn euros ($125bn; £80bn) in loans from eurozone funds to try to help shore up its banks. On 12 June, optimism over the bank bailout evaporates as Spain's borrowing costs rise to the highest rate since the launch of the euro in 1999. On 15 June, former UK chancellor of the exchequer Gordon Brown underlined fears of contagion with a warning that France and Italy may need a bailbout.g On 17 June, Greeks went to the polls, with the pro-austerity party New Democracy getting most votes., allaying fears the country was about to leave the eurozone.","The euro, the dream of many a politician in the years following World War II, was established in Maastricht by the European Union (EU) in 1992."
"Nikki FoxDisability correspondent The most recent investigation from the not-for-profit disability organisation reveals almost a quarter of all fashion retailers have no step-free access, with only 10% offering hearing loops to help deaf shoppers. When compared to a wider survey carried out in 2014, the results show a similar or in places poorer performance than before. It's been two years since DisabledGo shocked the government with evidence that highlighted the inaccessibility of the British High Street for disabled people. In 2014, the accessibility information providers visited over 25,000 shops and restaurants in person. It was one of the largest assessments of its kind in the UK. But fast-forward to 2017 and their most recent snapshot of 1,295 fashion retailers shows that not much has changed. Disability Works Disability Works: Breaking down barriers in business More Disability stories Speaking about the findings, Anna Nelson, executive director of DisabledGo.com, says: ""progress has been slow"". ""We were hoping the survey would show improvement over the past two years, but sadly this is not the case."" This week I'm looking into disability and the fashion industry, as part of the BBC's Disability Works week and have been given these exclusive figures. Of the 1,295 fashion retailers DisabledGo visited, over 60% didn't provide staff with any disability awareness training - a slight improvement on the 2014 audit. However, fewer retailers were able to provide a hearing loop, and the situation for wheelchair users was also slightly worse. High Street barriers Of the 1,295 fashion retailers DisabledGo visited: Business sense The latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show the collective spending power of disabled people, often referred to as the ""purple pound"", has risen to £249bn. ""You would think that this together with the legal obligations for every retailer to make reasonable adjustments would have been a catalyst for change,"" says DisabledGo.com's Anna Nelson. ""To us, providing great service to disabled people should just be about providing great customer service."" The Equality Act 2010 is meant to ensure disabled people have equal access in all areas of life. This may mean changing the way in which services are delivered, providing extra equipment and/or removing physical barriers. But when it comes to fashion, the barriers facing disabled people don't just stop at physical access. According to the disability charity Scope, the representation of disability on the High Street is ""simply not up to scratch"". Yet there are signs that the government is now recognising this issue. In a statement to the BBC, Penny Mordaunt, the Minister of State for Disabled People, said: ""Our shop windows, magazine pages and catwalks should reflect the diversity of our society, and I want to see businesses making a real effort to be open to everyone. ""That's why this week I've announced new champions to address the issues faced by disabled consumers, from buying clothes to travelling abroad. They'll highlight the importance of being inclusive, whilst tapping into the £249bn spending power of disabled consumers."" One woman on a mission to change things is Channel 4 presenter and product designer Sophie Morgan. In 2010 she designed and developed the ""mannequal"", a wheelchair for a sitting mannequin. Having modelled in the past, Sophie is passionate about fashion being ""for every body"". Around 2012 she managed to get her mannequal in the shop front of a large High Street store. Her product was used as part of a campaign during the London Paralympics. But as soon as the Games came to an end, so did the campaign and Sophie's mannequal. Disillusioned by the endless obstacles, Sophie put her mannequal to bed. But now, she feels it's the right time to try again. I met Sophie in London to see her product, fresh off the production line. It's the first time she's seen it in a shop front in nearly five years. ""Fashion designers are opening up to the creative opportunity of diversity. But while the public and the press recognise and celebrate equality on the catwalk, this has yet to filter down to the High Street. ""The product itself is just a small thing. We've got to make a push so that retailers actually go, 'yeah, OK, we'll listen,'"" says Sophie. ""This chair is just one small thing in the bigger picture, but I feel that's why I did it, it was like taking baby steps and see what happens. And this is that step."" Responding to the findings of the latest survey, the British Retail Consortium said retailers were working hard to ensure stores were as accessible as possible. ""For example, many have wide aisles, offer ramps as alternatives to stairs and have members of staff on hand to provide any additional assistance if required. ""Unfortunately retailers can be restricted on what reasonable adjustments can be made due to the age or design of a building but will have other policies in place to help access to that service."" 'We're the same' Away from the High Street, British design duo Teatum Jones have taken a giant step forward at this year's London Fashion Week. The casting of Kelly Knox, who was born without the lower half of her left arm, and amputee Jack Eyers is a first for London Fashion Week. But this is not a stunt, nor is it a campaign. Catherine Teatum and Rob Jones are thinking about disabled people when they design - something they don't feel is particularly revolutionary. ""They [disabled people] have a spending power that no one seems to be interested in tapping into. So that's a big enough reason to be honest, to begin with,"" they say. ""We haven't adapted anything for this collection, we approached the styling and the casting of this collection as we would any other collection. The main key message for us, is I feel like we are all the same. ""Why should someone with perhaps a seated disability… have any less desire for luxury fashion?""","New research shows that access to the High Street for disabled people remains ""slow"", according to a new survey by DisabledGo."
"By Emily YoungBBC News The World Economic Forum (WEF) has grown from a small huddle in the 1970s, when it was started by the academic Klaus Schwab, to hosting more than 3,000 participants, of which 900 are chief executives or company chairs and more than 70 are world leaders. Davos, where the meeting takes place, has now become shorthand for the forum's official title. This year, the big news is that US president Donald Trump is coming - the first sitting US president to attend the annual gathering in almost two decades. He'll be jostling for pole position against the likes of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron. UK Prime Minister Theresa May and new Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa are also attending. Other well-known participants include actor Cate Blanchett, musician Will.i.am and singer Sir Elton John. This year, the forum's official theme is: ""Creating a shared future in a fractured world."" Sexual harassment and gender inequality amid the #MeToo movement, the impact of advances in technology and globalisation as well as the differing world views of major politicians are likely to feature heavily. What's it like and what happens there? As you can imagine, there are lots of meetings, surrounded by varying degrees of secrecy. The public ones - which anyone can attend. The closed ones - which only those participants with a white badge can attend (i.e. they've paid to attend the conference or have been invited) and then the private ones that you don't even know have happened. Those are where the big deals are discussed, behind closed doors. Yes, but what really happens there? Well, in addition to all the talking there is a lot of partying - and mostly you don't have to pay. Companies who are attending the conference put on dinners and drinks to provide a networking opportunity for their clients. So yes there is food and drink on tap, but they're not exactly parties to write home about. Unless chief executives shaking their thing does it for you. Occasionally a big name band - such as The Killers - will appear to liven things up. But it's hardly Glastonbury - still mostly men in suits loitering around some canapes. A talking and dancing shop then? Maybe. But the idea behind the gathering is to spark ideas and conversations - it doesn't pretend to solve them there and then. Perhaps the best-known example of this is of Turkey not going to war with Greece when tensions escalated between the two in the 1980s. The oft-cited reason is that former Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal had met his Greek counterpart Andreas Papandreou in Davos and felt he could trust him. More recently, the Brics New Development Bank - an alternative to the World Bank and the IMF - was conceived during a conversation between economists Lord Stern and Joseph Stiglitz in Davos in 2011. I've got a few good ideas in which Mr Gates might be interested, how do I get to go? Well, you either have to be invited - and to do that, assuming you're not a world leader or chief executive, you probably need to be running a socially minded company or NGO. Or you can get your company to pay 27,000 Swiss francs (£20,250; $28,000), plus membership of the World Economic Forum and a very expensive hotel. One famous venture capital firm spends at least £500,000 keeping its investors happy at the event. If you haven't got that kind of money, you can still just turn up in a camper van, as some people plan to, and attend the fringe events. Wait, a camper van? I thought you said this wasn't Glastonbury? It's amazing the lengths people will go to to get a within a snowball's throw of the rich and famous. Planning starts months in advance and is carefully co-ordinated. You can get what's known as a ""hotel badge"" which does not give you access to the conference itself, but gets you past hotel security where the parties are held. Wow, is it worth it? Well, for the businesses that go, it's easier than flying all around the world to see your clients. Here, they're all in one place. For the hangers-on, at the very least you get to meet other ambitious hopefuls. OK, so supposing I manage to wangle an invite, what do I need to know? It's busy - the day usually starts with a breakfast invite for 7am and, if you're lucky, ends in the early hours at a party. It's cold - ski gear is ideal. But of course this is a conference and as soon as you get inside it's really warm so finding the appropriate clothing can be tricky. Many people carry a change of shoes in their bag and, as the fashion pages say, it's all about layers. Ahhh, I knew it, it's really about skiing isn't it? Surprisingly few people actually indulge - and I'm told the slopes are mostly empty. By the weekend, some delegates venture up there - the head of OECD think-tank, Angel Gurria, can usually be found gliding down the mountain.","It's that time of year when the rich, powerful and downright famous head to Swiss mountain village to discuss the big issues of the day and attempt to put the world to rights."
"It said more than 750,000 had been behind on housing costs last month. That is 450,000 more than January 2020. ""Despite widespread calls for forbearance in the face of the Covid-19 shock, just 3% of private renting families have been able to negotiate a lower rent over the last 10 months,"" the think tank said in a report. Meanwhile, one in 20 private renters in the UK said they had been refused rent reductions. Many had taken ""huge hits"" to their earnings and had ""limited savings"" to fall back on, research director Lindsay Judge said. ""To make matters worse, measures that could ease the pressure, such as discretionary housing payments from local authorities and negotiated rent reductions from landlords, are not getting through to those that need them."" Almost one in four private renters had seen their income fall as a result of the crisis, the body said. And it did not expect an easing of lockdown restrictions to be enough to solve their problems. ""Both benefit cuts and the end of furlough are pencilled in for the spring, either of which will strain family incomes further,"" it said. ""Likewise, unemployment looks set to rise, rather than fall, through 2021, potentially driving up arrears further still."" 'Rent-arrears crisis' Landlords in England have been banned from evicting tenants until at least the end of March, offering ""some security"", the Resolution Foundation said, by preventing families under the most strain becoming homeless during the pandemic. Housing is a devolved issue, and Wales and Scotland have also extended their bans to the end of March. In Northern Ireland, landlords are required to give tenants 12 weeks' notice to quit, before moving to eviction proceedings. The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But the Resolution Foundation also wants the government to offer loans to tenants to ease a ""rent-arrears crisis"" it expects to worsen in the months ahead. Meera Chindooroy, from the National Residential Landlords Association, said loans would help tackle the rent debts owed to property owners. ""Simply banning repossessions is doing nothing to address this underlying problem which renters and landlords are struggling to cope with,"" she said. A government spokeswoman said: ""Robust protections put in place by the government remain - with the vast majority of renters still subject to six months' notice periods, while the ban on bailiff evictions in all but the most serious circumstances will stay in place until at least 31 March.""","Almost half a million UK families are thought to have fallen behind on rent, as a result of the coronavirus crisis, according to the Resolution Foundation."
"The Derby-based firm, which makes plane engines, said the reduction of nearly a fifth of its workforce would mainly affect its civil aerospace division. ""This is not a crisis of our making. But it is the crisis that we face and must deal with,"" boss Warren East said. The bulk of the job cuts are expected to be in the UK at its site in Derby. Rolls-Royce employs 52,000 people globally and Mr East told the BBC's Today programme that the company had not yet concluded on ""exactly"" where the job losses would be, due to having to consult with unions. But he said: ""It's fair to say that of our civil aerospace business approximately two-thirds of the total employees are in the UK at the moment and that's probably a good first proxy."" Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace business has a number of sites in the UK, but the largest plant is in Derby. The company said it will also carry out a review of its sites but declined to comment on which ones may close. John, a worker in Rolls-Royce's civil aerospace division who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, said that while he expected there would be job cuts, the eventual 9,000 figure was ""a shock"". ""Since the Covid-19 outbreak we knew that business would shrink,"" he said. But he said the scale of the cuts as well as the potential closure of some sites was a surprise. Unite the union said the decision was ""shameful opportunism"". ""This company has accepted public money to furlough thousands of workers,"" said Unite's assistant general secretary for manufacturing, Steve Turner. ""Unite and Britain's taxpayers deserve a more responsible approach to a national emergency. We call upon Rolls-Royce to step back from the brink and work with us on a better way through this crisis."" Rolls-Royce initially furloughed 4,000 workers in the UK last month. Some 3,700 people remain on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme though which the government pays 80% of a worker's wage up to £2,500 a month. But Mr East said: ""No government can extend things like furlough schemes for years into the future. We have to look after ourselves and make sure we meet medium term demand."" Job cuts a heavy blow This morning's job losses are hardly unexpected - airlines have cut their flying hours by 90% or more, and Airbus and Boeing have slashed their production numbers for the next few years - but they are still a heavy blow to one of the UK's few world-class manufacturing companies. While the details of where the cuts will fall have not been finalised, it is likely that two-thirds will go in the UK. The company has already used the government's furlough scheme to help pay the wages of about 4,000 staff, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce's chief executive, said companies could not expect the government to continue such a scheme for several years. There was also a clear hint this morning that some factories may close - the company said it would review its future manufacturing footprint. Some questions remain for Roll-Royce. Investors are scratching their head about when the company's revenues - much of which rely on aircraft to be flying for money to flow - will return. The company has not yet tapped its shareholders for more money - some expect that may eventually come. Air travel has ground to a virtual standstill since the coronavirus began spreading across the world and many airlines have announced steep job cuts. Global air traffic is expected to decline by 45% this year, according to investment bank Baird. It also forecasts that airlines are expected to lose $310bn (£253bn) in revenue in 2020. Rolls-Royce said the impact of the pandemic on the company and the whole of the aviation industry ""is unprecedented"". It added that it is ""increasingly clear that activity in the commercial aerospace market will take several years to return to the levels seen just a few months ago"". As well as the job losses, the company said it would cut costs in areas such as its plants and properties. It expects to make cost savings of £1.3bn. Paul Everitt, chief executive of ADS, the aerospace industry association, said: ""The crisis is having a major impact on aerospace companies who provide high value, long-term jobs in all regions and nations of the UK, putting thousands more jobs at risk now and in the months ahead.""

"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter The consumer group warned the cash system is being threatened as shops have declined payments using banknotes and coins during the coronavirus crisis. Thousands of people have been prevented from paying with cash in recent months. This risks excluding vulnerable people, the campaign group said. Some shops have refused payments with banknotes and coins during the coronavirus crisis due to social distancing concerns, but this has threatened the viability of the cash system, it warned. Thomas Scobie of Stirling, who lives on universal credit, said: ""When shops started to accept only card payment it meant I couldn't buy the essentials I needed to feed myself."" He has a chronic health condition and a mental health disorder, so found the process of finding places to shop that would accept his cash ""a real struggle and depressing"". ""The reason I don't use a card is because I worry about the people that are able to clone cards and scam people and being on a fixed income, I simply couldn't survive if I lost any of that money,"" he said. Which? is asking businesses to show greater understanding and flexibility to customers who may only be able to pay in cash. ""The rapid move towards a cashless society risks excluding the most vulnerable from being able to pay for vital products and services,"" said Richard Piggin, head of external affairs and campaigns at Which?. ""We're alarmed at the reports of people leaving food and medicine behind because they can't pay with cash and it underlines how important it is to have a co-ordinated approach to protecting the fragile cash system."" Natalie Ceeney, chairwoman of the Access to Cash Review, said: ""Businesses who don't accept cash are saying to the most vulnerable in society: 'You're not welcome here'. ""Right now, as so many people are going through hardship and isolation, it's critical that no one gets excluded."" The government has plans to make rules to protect cash and, as part of this, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) could oversee that. Which? said it supports the proposal regarding the FCA and wants to see the regulator track levels of cash acceptance. ""The government has already proposed giving the FCA responsibility for cash,"" said My Piggin. ""It's vital that acceptance is also treated as a priority as part of this, as commitments to safeguarding cash access will be severely undermined if people are left with nowhere to spend it."" The Access to Cash Review revealed eight million people were at risk in the UK from the demise of cash. Nearly 2,500 people responded to Which?'s call for people to report their payment problems last month. Two fifths of those who reported being unable to pay with cash said that they did not have access to another payment method. 'Patronised' Some people were able to go to another shop to buy what they wanted but almost a third were unable to buy items or services at all. Which? said two out of five people were left empty handed when they had problems paying for groceries, while nearly a fifth had problems trying to buy medicine. Andy Fisher in Beverley said: ""I was told by one shop assistant that cash was 'a thing of the past' when I tried to buy some stationery, which made me feel uncomfortable and patronised. ""I feel that coronavirus is being used as an excuse to get rid of cash but lots of people locally still need it, such as the elderly or vulnerable."" John Howells, chief executive of cash machine network Link, said: ""We can't afford to sleepwalk into a cashless society where people are left behind."" Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ""Many older people rely on cash and it's really disappointing that even after venturing out to do their shopping, which for some feels like a significant risk at the moment, they may then be unable to buy their essential items.""","Stores refusing to accept cash have left consumers unable to buy basics such as groceries and medicine, according to Which?"
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The speech, made up of an Autumn Statement and a Spending Review, included a significant change of tactics - by scrapping his recent plan to cut tax credits. He threw himself into some big challenges - not least with buy-to-let landlords who could face a tax rise. But what does it mean for the finances of spectators on the sidelines - the UK public? Was that a tax credits U-turn? Tax credits are benefit payments for those on low incomes, aimed at topping up pay. They are the biggest welfare cost to the government apart from the state pension. In his summer Budget, Mr Osborne announced a plan for a £4.4bn cut to tax credits from April 2016. This meant cutting tax credits sooner and faster as a claimant's income rises. Having lost a key vote on the House of Lords, he promised to reconsider. He did so by scrapping the planned cuts. That means some low-income families who were expecting cuts in tax credit payments of up to £1,200 a year will no longer face that loss. He says he can do this because the state of the economy and the continued record low interest rates mean that he expects to have more money available than previously thought. So is that the end to cuts when I'm on a low income? No. Changes to the criteria of Universal Credit - a benefits system that sees tax credits and five other benefits merged into one in the next few years - were voted through recently and will also put a squeeze on some families making new claims. New claims for tax credits will be switched to Universal Credit from 2018. Groups such as the Resolution Foundation, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Citizens Advice say that by 2020, some families with children could be hit if parents are not working full-time. Plans to limit on tax credits for new claimants when they have more than two children remain. The rate of housing benefit in the social sector will also be capped at the same rate as is paid to those in the private rented sector, in order to make savings of £225m by 2020-21. This will apply to tenancies signed from April and affect housing benefit from April 2018 onwards. Will it become easier for me to buy a house? Money will be spent to encourage house builders to construct starter homes. These will be offered at a 20% discount on prices up to £450,000 in London and £250,000 elsewhere. The policy was first announced in October 2014. There will also be investment in a shared ownership scheme, reduced rent for those saving for deposit, and specialist homes for the elderly and those with a disability. The aim is to shift to aspirational home ownership, and help to reduce the housing benefit bill. There will also be a London Help to Buy scheme for those within the capital who can save a deposit of 5% of the value of the property they want to buy. They will be able to get an interest-free loan, for up to five years, worth up to 40% of the value of that home. Mr Osborne said that there was a crisis of home ownership among young people. How will this be paid for? A total of £1bn will be raised by 2021 owing to a change to stamp duty in England and Wales. A 3% surcharge on stamp duty when some buy-to-let properties and second homes are bought will be levied from April. This means it will add £5,520 of tax to be paid when buying the average £184,000 buy-to-let property. The new charge would have hit 160,000 buyers if it had applied last year. Commentators have already suggested this could hit the sector hard. This is the second big change to stamp duty, after reforms announced a year ago which affected the higher end of the property market. Are there any other tax rises I need to know about? Councils which have responsibility for social care will be able to add 2% to council tax bills in a bid to provide up to £2bn for that care. Taxpayers will have to wait to see exactly how that affects them in pounds and pence when they receive their council tax bill. Are pensions going up at all? The state pension for existing pensioners will rise by 2.9%, or £3.35, to £119.30 a week from April, to match the rise in average earnings. This is the result of triple-lock pledge on pensions - a government promise for the next five years - which means the state pension rises each April to match the highest of inflation, earnings, or 2.5%. Next year is a significant one for new retirees as it is the start, from April, of the new ""flat-rate"" state pension, set at £155 a week. However, not everyone will get the full amount, such as some of those with a private or workplace pension provision. Some who have built up an additional state pension may get more. Any bad news for pensioners? They have been protected from a lot of cuts by this government. However, the chancellor said that pension credit payments will be stopped for people who leave the country for more than one month. At present, pension credit is paid for up to 13 weeks while claimants are temporarily abroad. If they go overseas for medical treatment under the NHS, then it is paid for longer. The same new restriction for those going overseas will also apply to housing benefit. What about the young? Any major changes for students and recent students? Graduates in England and Wales who started university on or after September 2012 will see their student loan repayment threshold frozen until April 2021, rather than rising in line with inflation. These graduates can earn up to £21,000 before making student loan repayments. Freezing the threshold could make repayments more expensive. Nursing students will no longer receive government bursaries. They will have to take out loans instead. What about my wages? We already know that a 1% cap on rises in public sector pay will be in place for the next four years. We also know a compulsory Living Wage - basically, a new minimum wage - will be paid to people aged 25 and over, starting in April 2016 at £7.20 an hour and reaching £9 an hour by 2020. Childcare is a big hit on our income, what has happened to that? The government had previously said it would give further support for childcare costs. The chancellor announced 30 hours of free childcare for three and four-year-olds will be available from 2017 in England, but only to parents working more than 16 hours and who each earn £100,000 or less. Many parents already get a free 15 hours of childcare for three and four-year-olds. Any other announcements that affect my finances? The chancellor announced a plan to end the right to cash compensation following crashes on the roads. This, he says, will make it harder for people to get compensation for exaggerated or fraudulent whiplash claims. Should the insurance industry pass on these savings, then motor insurance premiums could fall. Statement and Spending Review 2015 Presented by Chancellor George Osborne, the Spending Review sets out what government spending will be over the next four years, while the Autumn Statement is an annual update of government plans for the economy. Special report: Full in-depth coverage of the Spending Review and Autumn Statement Documents: Link to full Autumn Statement and Spending Review documents via HM Treasury Watch: The BBC's TV coverage begins on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel at 11:30 GMT, with BBC Radio 5 Live coverage from 11:55 GMT","In a speech that lasted for more than an hour, Chancellor George Osborne revealed his financial game plan and how this will affect the wallets and purses of the watching public."
"The Gambling Commission said the three firms did not have ""effective safeguards"" to prevent money laundering and harm to customers from gambling. Daub Alderney was fined £7.1m, Casumo £5.85m. Videoslots is to pay £1m in lieu of a financial penalty. A fourth firm, CZ Holdings, surrendered its licence to operate in the UK. ""I hope today's announcement will make all online casino operators sit up and pay attention, as our investigations found that a large number of operators and their senior management were not meeting their obligations,"" said Neil McArthur, the chief executive of the Gambling Commission. ""We expect operators to know their customers and to ask the right questions to make sure they meet their anti-money laundering and social responsibility obligations."" After a review which started in February, the Commission found that Videoslots had been making initial inquiries into the source of customer funds, but failed to continue to make checks. In one case a Videoslots customer failed automated identity checks and instead provided a fraudulent driving licence, which was not detected. The customer registered multiple fraudulent credit cards, which were also not detected. Those cards were used to deposit and gamble with ""large amounts"". The customer had deposited £17,405 by the time the company's systems flagged the account. The Commission said those deposits were ""suspected to be the proceeds of crime"". Videoslots accepted that it had weaknesses in its systems and had taken action to address the issues, the Commission said. The company's settlement payment will go towards research and the treatment of problem gambling. A review of Casumo's business, which began in January, found that the company had failed to check customers properly and monitor their activities. Its investigation reviewed the accounts of three customers that showed potential signs of problem gambling, but did not trigger any action from Casumo. Since then the company has taken action to improve its procedures, the Commission said. Earlier this month, the Commission announced it was fining Daub Alderney £7.1m. The company's monitoring of customers was also found to be inadequate, but it has since tightened its procedures.",Three online casino companies will pay penalties of £14m and one has been prevented from operating in the UK following a crackdown by the industry regulator.
"Several of its employees are being questioned by the country's authorities, although Petra says it has not formally been told the reasons why. Petra has also suspended operations at one of its mines in Tanzania. The country's government has passed new laws raising mining taxes and forcing companies to renegotiate contracts. Petra's operations in the country are 25%-owned by Tanzania's government. Valuation row The diamonds were on their way to Antwerp in Belgium, one of the most important cities in the global diamond trade. Tanzania says the value of the shipment, from the Williamson mine, was $29.5m (£22.4m), and that Petra had under-declared its value. The government said at the weekend it planned to nationalise the diamonds. Petra says it is not responsible for the provisional valuation of diamond parcels from Williamson before they are exported. It says this is carried out by the government's diamonds and gemstones valuation agency. The company has suspended operations at the mine, for ""health and safety and security reasons"". Petra said it conducted all operations related to the Williamson mine in a ""transparent manner"". In a statement, the company said: ""Petra confirms that a parcel of diamonds (71,654.45 carats) from the Williamson mine in Tanzania has been blocked from export to Petra's marketing office in Antwerp and certain key personnel from Williamson are currently being questioned by the authorities. ""However the grounds upon which these actions have been taken have not been formally made known to the Company as yet."" It added it would provide an update ""in due course"". Last week, the Tanzanian President, John Magufuli, ordered a review of a Petra contract. Gold miner Acacia has also fallen foul of the Tanzanian authorities. Earlier in the summer, it was hit with a tax bill for $190bn after government-appointed committees said it was operating illegally and had understated its gold exports. Last week, Acacia said it was scaling back operations in Tanzania. Mining accounts for about 4% of the south-east African country's economy.",Petra Diamonds shares have fallen 7% after it said a parcel of its diamonds mined in Tanzania had been blocked from export by the country's government.
"By Russell HottenBBC News, New York The president asked if Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was a greater ""enemy"" than China's leader Xi Jinping. It followed a speech in which Mr Powell said trade tensions were hitting the global economy and the Fed didn't have a ""rulebook"" to deal with the fallout. On Friday, China imposed new tariffs, with Mr Trump promising retaliation. Mr Powell was giving a keynote speech at the annual convention for central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Although he said the US economy was in a ""favourable place"" he listed a series of economic and geopolitical risks linked to Mr Trump's trade war with China. There are ""no recent precedents to guide any policy response to the current situation,"" Mr Powell said, adding that monetary policy ""cannot provide a settled rulebook for international trade"". The Fed chief has been under pressure from Mr Trump for a deep cut in interest rates, and has faced a series of derogatory Twitter posts from the president. But Friday's attacks were among the most critical. ""As usual, the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can 'speak' without knowing or asking what I am doing, which will be announced shortly,"" Mr Trump wrote on Twitter. ""We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work 'brilliantly' with both, and the US will do great."" In another tweet, he said: ""My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powel or Chairman Xi?"" China said on Friday it would impose retaliatory tariffs against about $75bn worth of US goods, putting as much as an extra 10% on top of existing rates in the dispute between the world's top two economies. Mr Trump indicated he was planning retaliation, but it was unclear what that would be. The president said in a subsequent Twitter post that he would respond to China's tariffs later on Friday. Wall Street share markets dived on the escalating tensions, with the three main indexes down between 1.7% and 2% in late morning trading. Some analysts think Mr Trump has been ratcheting up his criticism of Mr Powell so he can blame the fed chair if the US economy goes into downturn. Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, told the BBC earlier this week: ""Mr Trump doesn't care what rates are. He cares about who voters think is to blame for slower growth and market turmoil, and he is determined to be sure it isn't him,"" she said. ""What's an astute politician to do? Find a fall guy distrusted by Republicans, Democrats, independents, populists, and progressives.""",Donald Trump reacted furiously on Friday after the head of the US central bank spoke about the economic risks of a trade war with China.
"By Harry KretchmerOn the Money, 5 live Almost a billion parcels are estimated to have been delivered in the UK in 2012 by an expanding logistics workforce of around 1.8 million people, supporting a domestic parcel industry worth around £4.4bn. Self-employed drivers now make up anything between 5-8% of UK logistics workers, with one of the most rapid expansions in the group known in the industry as 'lifestyle couriers'. These are individuals who, out of choice or necessity, spend varying amounts of time each week delivering parcels, usually around their neighbourhoods. It has been happening for decades, but the scale has changed. Now, if you order home deliveries from a wide range of well-known online, catalogue and high street retailers it is likely some of your goods will have spent some time in the boot of a lifestyle courier's car. Coping with growth James Cartledge, editor of industry magazine Post & Parcel, explains why the face of parcel deliveries is changing. ""Business-to-business is still dominant in the market but e-commerce will push the business-to-consumer side to match it in the next few years. ""Now, most of the big parcel industry players also use lifestyle couriers to help them cope."" The rise of Hermes, the largest player in the UK lifestyle courier market, mirrors the development of the market. Ten years ago, the Leeds-based subsidiary of the multinational delivery group had 2,500 lifestyle couriers on its books. Today it is 7,500 and expanding fast. From Greenock to Greenwich, Hermes expects to have delivered a record 160 million parcels in the 12 months to February, boosted by a spike of 18 million during December. Lifestyle what? A dozen, randomly-selected online shoppers in Manchester seemed to know little about who was delivering their online and catalogue orders, with some assuming online giants like Amazon had their own drivers. ""I suppose whatever saves them money and gets it here quicker"", was one typical response. Ged, from Stockport, is one of the new-style couriers. He signed up with Hermes after taking voluntary redundancy following 26 years in local government. ""I wanted a change to become my own boss and that's how come I'm tippin' up as a parceller"", he explains. Now he delivers 60 to 70 parcels every Saturday from the boot of his small saloon car. A typical load might include a dozen home shopping catalogues, several boxes of shoes and a vacuum cleaner. Them and us The rise of lifestyle couriers has not been embraced by some full-time self-employed delivery drivers, who typically charge more to cover higher overheads, including specialist vehicles and insurance. Peter Turner, spokesman for the Self Employed Owner Drivers Association UK, describes lifestyle couriers as ""a pain in the neck!"" ""If they didn't exist there would be more work for the self-employed guy - it's got to have a knock-on effect somewhere along the line."" The fledgling profession is also criticised by some of those who claim to practise it. Low wages are a frequent source of complaint on the internet forums that have sprung up dedicated to lifestyle couriers. However, as a representative of the industry, Hermes argues that remuneration is fair and competitive, with additional payments depending on the job as well as opportunities for drivers to negotiate their pay. Ged, from Stockport, is phlegmatic: ""Every little helps, as they say."" Level playing field? As the 'Designated Universal Service Provider' (DUSP), the Royal Mail is subject to strict conditions, including the requirement to deliver to every UK address six days week, at affordable and uniform prices. By contrast, postal regulator Ofcom admits lifestyle firms play by different rules. ""Packet and parcel operators are, and always have been, very lightly regulated, although they must have a process in place to handle complaints"", says a spokesman. Ian Senior, an economist specialising in the postal industry, thinks the relative freedoms of the lifestyle market should be preserved, for now at least. ""Frankly, I think they have quite an uphill battle to prove their credibility but I don't want to see the big heavy hand of regulation coming in yet again"", Mr Senior says. With e-commerce projected to grow at 15% per year, James Cartledge thinks lifestyle couriers are here to stay: ""You can buy five pairs of trousers, try them on at home and send four of them back. Lifestyle couriers are part of that explosion."" The director of sales and marketing at Hermes, Gary Winter, is upbeat about future growth. ""Whether it's infinite, I don't know. But there are still 20% of people who've never purchased anything on the internet."" On the Money is at 20:00 every Sunday on 5 live","Non-professional couriers, using their own cars and spare time, are becoming a force to be reckoned with as the internet reshapes the UK's logistics industry."
"Nando's, Pret A Manger and McDonald's are among firms to promise reductions after the chancellor ordered a temporary VAT cut from 20% to 5%. The Treasury estimates households could save £160 a year on average, but not all firms will pass on the benefit. Many companies are expected to use the windfall to shore up finances hit by the lockdown, rather than cut prices. The VAT reduction will stay until 12 January next year, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced last week. It was part of a package of measures to help firms recover and get consumers spending. VAT - Value Added Tax - is paid on everyday goods and services, but the tax is usually included in the price most consumers see. Several restaurants and food-to-go chains have announced price cuts: What is VAT? Value Added Tax, or VAT, is the tax you have to pay when you buy goods or services. The standard rate of VAT in the UK is 20%, with about half the items households spend money on subject to this rate. There is a reduced rate of 5% which applies to some things such as children's car seats and home energy. When you see a price for something in a shop, any VAT will already have been added. There are also various items for which you do not have to pay any VAT, such as most supermarket food, children's clothing, newspapers and magazines. Read more about VAT It is clear that many businesses will not be passing on the reduction. Malcolm Bell, chief executive of Visit Cornwell, said the chancellor's move was to support business, not help holidaymakers. He said some firms had reported tourists calling them to ask for 15% off their holiday booking. ""My message to customers is this is to help the businesses, not to reduce the cost of their holiday. It is only a temporary relaxation up to January."" Many attractions such as museums, parks and zoos, might also not pass on the reduction. Bernard Donoghue, director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (Alva), said he expected the VAT cut would go towards helping venues ""repair their finances as opposed to being passed on to customers"". Alva members were seeing a spike in demand after three months of lockdown, with attractions that offer pre-booked visits ""vastly oversubscribed"", he said. Pub chain Wetherspoon said it would use the tax break to help fund lower prices on some of its most popular beers. However, this move drew criticism from Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), and James Calder, chief executive of the Society for Independent Brewers (Siba). ""Like all pubs, Wetherspoon will not be able to benefit from a VAT reduction on beer sales and it is disappointing to see them potentially mislead customers into believing cheaper beer prices are as a direct result of the chancellor's measures,"" he said. Wetherspoon has produced promotional posters to advertise food price cuts, including one called Sunak's Specials and another called Dishi Rishi. Its chairman, Tim Martin, has campaigned for tax equality between pubs, restaurants and supermarkets for many years. He said: ""Supermarkets pay no VAT on food sales and pubs pay 20%. Supermarkets pay about 2p per pint of business rates and pubs pay about 20p. ""A VAT reduction will help pubs and restaurants reverse this trend - creating more jobs, helping high streets and eventually generating more tax income for the government."" But he said that not every hospitality business would be able to reduce prices immediately. ""Some will need to retain the benefit of lower VAT just to stay in business. Others may need to invest in upgrading their premises. ""However, lower VAT and tax equality will eventually lead to lower prices, more employment, busier High Streets and more taxes for the government.""","A £4bn cut in VAT has come into force, allowing firms in the food, drink and hospitality sectors to slash prices."
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has called for a 2% tax on family fortunes above $50m. Rival candidate Bernie Sanders, who tugged the Democratic Party to the left in his 2016 presidential run, is back with his own tax on ""extreme wealth"" and remains another top contender. Billionaires such as George Soros, Warren Buffett, Eli Broad and Marc Benioff have also come out in support of higher taxes on the super rich. Even US President Donald Trump speaks about the need to close tax loopholes for the wealthy. Yet for years, standard political doctrine has held that anti-tax sentiment is as American as apple pie. So what's going on? Growing gap Americans have long told opinion polls they think the wealthy should pay more. But the issue has gained political traction in recent years, galvanised by eye-catching research about rising income inequality, stalling upward mobility and findings that the richest 400 Americans now pay lower tax rates than any other income group. Economists are engaged in a heated debate about just how big the gulf between rich and poor is. But there is little doubt that the gap has widened sharply over four decades toward record levels, fuelled by a mix of forces, including rapid gains in company shares and a relatively stagnant minimum wage. The US central bank estimates that the top 1% of US households hold about 39% of the country's wealth, a term that includes assets such as property. The top 1% also account for about 13% of income, after taxes and other federal transfers, according to a 2016 Congressional Budget Office analysis. That's a higher share than in the UK, where the top 1% is estimated to account for about 8% of income and around 24% of overall wealth. Tax backlash Exposés of how some wealthy individuals have avoided paying their taxes in full, and scandals such as celebrities bribing college admissions officers for their children, have added to the anger. Almost two-thirds of Americans told Pew Research Center this year that they were bothered ""a lot"" by the feeling that some corporations and the wealthy don't pay their fair share of taxes. Even a poll from Fox News - a television network known for its conservative bent - found that 70% of voters favoured tax increases on families making more than $10m a year. The discontent is especially deep among Democrats, who were outraged when Republicans cut rates for the wealthy and corporations as part of a $1.5 trillion tax cut in 2017. Just 32% of Democrats now say the present federal tax system is fair, compared with 64% of Republicans, Pew found. ""There's genuine frustration around the country and the political discussion is, I think, reflecting that,"" says Arloc Sherman, senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington think tank. ""And it's about time,"" he adds. Wall Street worries As fury over the economic divide grows louder, the American business class, traditionally a staunch defender of low-tax regimes, has started to shift its tone. This summer, to great fanfare, a key business group declared that companies' interests extended beyond shareholders to include employees and local communities. Other Wall Street titans have argued that reform of capitalism is necessary to head-off more draconian changes. But their worries don't necessarily signal that higher taxes are likely anytime soon, according to Andrea Louise Campbell, a political science professor at MIT, who is working on a book about American attitudes toward taxation. She says that although Americans have said they favour higher taxes on the wealthy for years, when it comes to the ballot box their support depends on what kind of tax is being proposed. Voters typically back high rates on annual income but not, for example, on inheritances. Reducing inequality also routinely ranks low on the list of voter priorities - with fewer than 3% identifying it as the top problem in Gallup surveys. ""It is certainly the case that income inequality has increased and many Americans are aware of that and are unhappy with the trend, but translating that into a desire for redistributive taxing and spending policies is more difficult,"" Ms Campbell says. Democrats divided A few newspaper columns and famous names notwithstanding, surveys show the rich tend to be anti-tax - and the rich still have the most influence. Despite the populist tone US President Donald Trump struck during his 2016 presidential campaign, once in office he championed a tax cut that disproportionately benefited the wealthy. There is even a divide among Democrats, as many moderates stop short of supporting a wealth tax - which covers items such as property, yachts and art in addition to income - that is backed by Ms Warren and Mr Sanders. They have argued that such plans are not only unrealistic but bad policy, since they can be difficult to enforce. Wealth taxes have been phased out in much of Europe, and they would almost certainly face a legal challenge in the US over whether they meet the constitution's criteria for what the federal government is allowed to tax. Even if the public was convinced by Ms Warren's proposal - which would place a 2% tax on household assets over $50m and 3% over $1bn - it's unlikely to make it past Republicans and lobbyists in Washington, Ms Campbell adds. ""The role of public opinion in setting taxes is relatively modest,"" says Ms Campbell. ""Even if ordinary Americans on average would like increased taxes on high income, high wealth people, I don't think they're the ones with influence on policymakers.""",Higher taxes are a hot topic in American political circles.
"It means BP will have to make the payments that stem from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. BP argued that the deal meant it could fall prey to inflated or bogus compensation claims. BP agreed to the compensation deal in 2012, but argues it has been misinterpreted. Shares in BP fell 1.7% in London on Monday. BP asked the Supreme Court to consider whether people and businesses seeking payments under the settlement included individuals who had not actually suffered any injury as a result of the oil spill. The Supreme Court's rejection of this appeal by BP is the latest in a series of setbacks for the oil firm. BP is trying to limit payments over the environmental disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 people and became the largest US offshore oil spill in history. The settlement agreement has no cap, but BP initially estimated that it would pay roughly $7.8bn (£6.1bn) to compensate victims. It now says it can no longer give a reliable estimate for how much the deal will cost. BP has already paid out $2.3bn in so-called business economic loss claims out of a total of $4.25bn in compensation claims to individuals and businesses, according to Patrick Juneau, the administrator appointed by the courts to handle claims. The settlement process is also separate from other court proceedings relating to the spill, including environmental and criminal penalties. BP has set aside $43bn to resolve all claims. In September, a US judge ruled BP was ""grossly negligent"" in the lead-up to the 2010 oil spill. The New Orleans judge Carl Barbier also found BP subcontractors Transocean and Halliburton ""negligent"".",The US Supreme Court has rejected oil giant BP's legal challenge to a compensation deal over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
"By Anthony ReubenHead of statistics, BBC News The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has raised its borrowing forecast for the current financial year from £86.6bn to £91.3bn, which is still below last year's total of £97.5bn. The figure was announced in Chancellor George Osborne's Autumn Statement. The OBR also raised its forecast for economic growth this year from 2.7% to 3.0%, and from 2.3% to 2.4% next year. The rise in the growth forecast brings the independent OBR into line with the consensus in the City, although it is still below the Bank of England's estimate. While the OBR has raised its growth forecast for the next two years, it has cut it for the following three years. Spending cuts The rise in the borrowing forecast is a result of the surprisingly low tax take. Many analysts had been expecting the borrowing forecasts to rise by more because, as the chancellor conceded, ""tax receipts have deteriorated"" by more than the OBR had predicted. Mr Osborne said the biggest factor keeping borrowing down was that the amount of interest being paid on the debt was lower than had been expected. But there were stark warnings from the OBR in its report accompanying the Autumn Statement of the amount of spending cuts still to come from the government. It said that the government's overall plan for spending on public services was to reduce it from £5,650 per head in 2009-10 to £3,880 per head in 2019-20. The OBR warned that only about 40% of that cut would be made during the current Parliament, with the remaining 60% still to come in the next one. ""Total public spending is now projected to fall to 35.2% of GDP in 2019-20, taking it below the previous post-war lows reached in 1957-58 and 1999-00 to what would probably be its lowest level in 80 years."" The OBR also said: ""Despite strong economic growth, the budget deficit is expected to fall by only £6.3bn this year to £91.3bn, around half the decline we expected in March. ""That would be the second smallest year-on-year reduction since its peak in 2009-10, despite this being the strongest year for GDP growth."" The government was still set to miss its target of having net debt fall as a share of GDP in 2015-16, the independent forecaster said. It expected net debt to rise by 0.8% of GDP in that year, when it will peak at 81.1%. In his response to the Autumn Statement, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ""Over two years [Mr Osborne] has revised up borrowing by £12.5bn."" ""This means the chancellor will have borrowed in this Parliament £219bn more than he planned in 2010."" Inflation forecast The increase in the borrowing forecast had been expected because the government borrowed £64.1bn in the first seven months of the financial year, an increase of £3.7bn from the same period last year. The forecast for borrowing next year has been raised from £68.7bn to £75.9bn, but the predictions for the years after that have improved. The OBR expects inflation measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) of 1.5% this year, 1.2% next year and 1.7% the year after. It had previously said that CPI would only fall slightly below the Bank of England's forecast rate of 2.0% this year before returning to that level. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the interest paid on government debt in the year to the end of October came in at £49.2bn, down from £50.4bn in the previous 12 months, despite rising debt. Lower inflation forecasts also mean the government expects to have to make lower welfare payments and lower uprating on public sector pensions. Some analysts had also suggested that the point at which the government finances moves into surplus could be delayed by a year, but in fact the surplus for 2018-19 has only been reduced from £5bn to £4bn, with a surplus of £23bn predicted for 2019-20.",The government is expected to borrow more money this year than had previously been predicted.
"But that will change in the coming months, so what difference will 5G make to our lives? What is 5G exactly? It's the next generation of mobile internet connection and offers much faster data download and upload speeds. Through greater use of the radio spectrum it will allow far more devices to access the mobile internet at the same time. What will it enable us to do? ""Whatever we do now with our smartphones we'll be able to do faster and better,"" says Ian Fogg from OpenSignal, a mobile data analytics company. ""Think of smart glasses featuring augmented reality, mobile virtual reality, much higher quality video, the internet of things making cities smarter. ""But what's really exciting is all the new services that will be built that we can't foresee."" Imagine swarms of drones co-operating to carry out search and rescue missions, fire assessments and traffic monitoring, all communicating wirelessly with each other and ground base stations over 5G networks. Similarly, many think 5G will be crucial for autonomous vehicles to communicate with each other and read live map and traffic data. Mobile gamers should notice less delay - or latency - when pressing a button on a controller and seeing the effect on screen. Mobile videos should be near instantaneous and glitch-free. Video calls should become clearer and less jerky. Wearable fitness devices could monitor your health in real time, alerting doctors as soon as any emergency arises. How does it work? It's a new radio technology, but you might not notice vastly higher speeds at first because 5G is likely to be used by network operators initially as a way to boost capacity on existing 4G core networks, to ensure a more consistent service for customers. The speed you get will depend on which spectrum band the operator runs the 5G technology on and how much your carrier has invested in new masts and transmitters. So we may see clusters of smaller phone masts closer to the ground transmitting so-called ""millimetre waves"" between much higher numbers of transmitters and receivers. This will enable higher density of usage. But it's expensive and companies could face challenges deploying lots of new masts. So how fast could it be? The fastest current 4G mobile networks offer about 45Mbps (megabits per second) on average, although the industry is still hopeful of achieving 1Gbps (gigabit per second = 1,000Mbps) Chipmaker Qualcomm reckons 5G could achieve browsing and download speeds about 10 to 20 times faster in real-world (as opposed to laboratory) conditions. That would allow you to download a high-definition film in a minute or so. The big improvement in speed and latency will come when service providers roll out standalone 5G networks, where both the core and radio networks use 5G tech. They could easily achieve gigabit-plus browsing speeds as standard. But these aren't likely to come until next year in the UK. Why do we need it? The world is going mobile and we're consuming more data every year, particularly as the popularity of video and music streaming increases. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns in service, particularly when lots of people in the same area are trying to access online mobile services at the same time. 5G is much better at handling thousands of devices simultaneously, from mobiles to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Will I need a new phone? Yes. But when 4G was introduced in 2009/10, compatible smart phones came onto the market before the infrastructure had been rolled out fully, leading to some frustration amongst consumers who felt they were paying more in subscriptions for a patchy service. Will it work in rural areas? Lack of signal and low data speeds in rural areas is a common complaint in the UK and many other countries. But 5G won't necessarily address this issue as it will operate on high-frequency bands - to start with at least - that have a lot of capacity but cover shorter distances. 5G will primarily be an urban service for densely populated areas. Lower-frequency bands (600-800Mhz typically) are better over longer distances, so network operators will concentrate on improving their 4G LTE coverage in parallel with 5G roll-out. But commercial reality means that for some people in very remote areas, connectivity will still be patchy at best without government subsidy making it worthwhile for network operators to go to these places.

"The value of held sales totals a collective £82bn, researchers at property portal Zoopla have estimated. Agreed sales were running at a tenth of the normal level for the time of year, and were akin to the activity seen in late December, they said. Spring is usually a busy time for the housing and mortgage markets. It is known in the trade as the ""spring bounce"". However, the stay-at-home message from the government has meant that people are only moving to new homes in rare circumstances, such as entering a vacant property. Government advice is for sellers and buyers to come to an amicable arrangement over delaying a moving date. Zoopla researchers said the rate of sales falling through peaked on 23 March - the day the UK lockdown began. It added that demand for housing was down 60% on levels recorded at the start of March. However, the picture varied across UK cities, with Cardiff recording an 80% drop in demand from buyers, and Newcastle a 48% fall. Zoopla said people had been browsing for homes less on the internet, but this had recovered slightly in the last couple of weeks, perhaps in response to the fact people are living and working from home and yearning for more room on the domestic front. ""Some may feel the urge to move and find more space or consider the potential for remote working,"" said Richard Donnell, director of research and insight at Zoopla. ""This could boost activity in the second half of 2020, but this all depends upon how much the economy is impacted over the rest of the year and the impact on levels of unemployment."" Overall, Zoopla expects the number of completed sales across the UK this year to be around half that seen in 2019.","Some 373,000 property sales are on hold owing to the coronavirus lockdown, analysis of the housing market in UK cities suggests."
"By Mahfuz SadiqueBBC News, Dhaka Since the Rana Plaza factory building collapsed three months ago killing more than 1,100 people, hundreds of textile workers have been falling ill en masse, blaming drinking water or bad food. But tests have revealed nothing unusual. In another instance, production at a factory was halted after workers reported sightings of a ghost. Work could only resume after special prayers. Public health officials suspect the phenomenon is ""mass hysteria"" - a panicked reaction to the recent deaths of so many fellow workers. Painful memories aside, realities on the ground are not helping either. There are regular reports of cracks in buildings and fires at factories in Bangladesh's ready-made clothing industry, which, with an annual turnover of $21bn (£14bn), is now second in size only to China's. In the immediate aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse, there was a chaotic rush to inspect factories at apparent risk. Multiple government departments, Western retailers and an influential trade body, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), have been carrying out their own investigations. An initial visual inspection of 102 buildings, including 60 garment factories, by experts at the country's leading engineering university found that most had some structural problems. In the weeks following the April disaster, more than a dozen clothing factories were shut down amid safety concerns. Global outcry The official response to one of the world's worst industrial disasters has been swift. In late June, the United States revoked preferential trade privileges for Bangladesh until reforms in the clothing industry were carried out. The EU has also put conditions on Bangladesh maintaining its lucrative duty free access to its clothing markets. Both the EU and the US - the top two destinations for Bangladesh's clothing exports - have put special emphasis on the passing of a new labour law, which will ensure freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. Bangladesh's parliament passed a labour law with new amendments on 15 July. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) and various rights groups, including New York-based Human Rights Watch, have said that while the new law makes some improvements, it falls short on key issues. The ILO's concerns include a condition in the new law that at least 30% of all workers at an establishment have to sign up first to form a union and not giving freedom of association rights to workers at export processing zones. Responding to some of the criticism, Mikail Shipar, Bangladesh's Labour and Employment Secretary, said: ""It is the best labour law - so far."" ""Of course, it can be improved. But it will take more time. In this moment, we are unable to allow more than three trade unions in a factory. We are [also]unable to introduce outsiders [- officials employed by the union rather than the company -] in a trade union."" Crucial months The other big concern since the Rana Plaza collapse has been how to make Bangladesh's clothing factories safe. Retailers on both sides of the Atlantic have so far signed up to two different safety plans. More than 70 clothing brands, mainly from Europe, have joined a legally binding safety pact launched by global unions. The plan includes inspections of factories that supply the brands' clothes and provides financing to fix any problems that are identified. A separate North American safety alliance has announced plans to provide loans to fix or relocate structurally unsound buildings. It has been criticised by unions, however, for not being legally binding. And some major brands, including Top Shop and the Japanese company Uniqlo, have not yet signed up to either the pact or the alliance These plans are in addition to a national Bangladeshi plan being facilitated by the ILO. ""One of the important commitments is to assess all the ready-made garment factories in Bangladesh by the end of this year. It is estimated that some 3,500 factories are there,"" says Srinivas B Reddy, country director for the ILO in Bangladesh. Mr Reddy points out that common safety standards need to be agreed for all the public and private initiatives to help workers. ""The coming months are crucial,"" he says. 'My factory is not safe' With all the promises made by governments and brands, do the workers now feel safe? Kalpona Akter, a prominent labour rights activist, says while much action has been promised, it still remains at the policy level. Workers at factories don't know about it, and are yet to benefit from any proposed measures, she says. But they are taking matters into their own hands. ""On the ground level, workers are taking some initiatives to make changes. Like whenever they see these sparks in the factory, or the crack in the buildings, they are walking out from the factory,"" says Ms Akter, who is executive director at the Bangladesh Centre for Workers Solidarity. ""They are saying, 'My factory is not safe. And, until it is safe, I will not come back.'"" Three months on, the aftershocks from the collapse of Rana Plaza can be felt at the boardrooms of major companies and in the corridors of governments. The deaths of so many people three months ago may have prompted a global outcry. But Bangladeshi workers know that changes on the ground will take time.",Strange things have been happening at some clothing factories in Bangladesh.
"The boss of Volkswagen's US business, Michael Horn, has admitted it ""totally screwed up"" in using software to rig emissions tests. Last Friday, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said VW diesel cars had much higher emissions than tests had suggested and that software in several diesel cars could deceive regulators. Here is selection of your views on Volkswagen's emissions-rigging scandal. @SaratogaSprngs tweets that Volkswagen made the right move in admitting their mistake: I am absolutely disgusted with this. I purchased my VW Golf due to the fantastic low emissions it was ""claimed"" to produce. Now I'm worrying that my car could be recalled. It's clear that VW would have happily carried on with this lie to its customers. The reason I chose such a car was because VW was a well-known respectable company but this could not be further from the truth. I want to know as soon as possible if my car has been affected and if so what are the actions from this point on. Oliver Ealey, Oxfordshire, UK Volkswagen scandal 11 million Vehicles affected worldwide €6.5bn Set aside by VW $18bn Potential fines No. 1 Global carmaker in sales I purchased a VW Golf BlueMotion because low emissions are important to me. With hindsight it appears that the stats for the vehicle really were too good to be true. My confidence in the claims made by vehicle manufacturers is seriously diminished. I hope there will be more vigorous testing and greater transparency in future. I will also consider switching from a diesel to a hybrid. Robin Cole, Surrey, UK @MihirBajoria tweets his disappointment in Volkswagen: I drive a VW company car. One of my decisions when choosing it was the CO2 emissions figure. Simply because the higher it is the more tax I pay. What are VW and/or the UK government going to do if as a result of this apparent fraud by VW it means the official CO2 figures are reviewed and are higher than previously stated, meaning I have to pay more tax? David Turnbull, Edinburgh, Scotland In July I took delivery of a new diesel Polo and my decision was based on the fact that the advertised fuel consumption / CO2 emissions were 75% of that of my 10-year-old diesel Polo. I was extremely disappointed to discover that there is actually little difference between fuel consumption in both vehicles. Had I known this, I would not have replaced the old one because it is in good condition. I have been a lifelong VW loyalist. Deeply disappointed. Eric de la Harpe, Oxfordshire, UK Bob Smith in Scotland messaged on WhatsApp to say he chose Volkswagen to do his bit for the environment: I purchased a VW SportWagen in 2009. My primary interests were in the durability, mileage and cleanliness of the clean diesel engine. I'm worried that any fix will affect these and make the car into the slow, problem prone VW diesel Rabbit of the 1970s. Byron Johnson, Texas, USA At present we have a 2010 petrol Golf and a 2012 diesel Golf. I am extremely disappointed with this behaviour. We have had five VWs in the family. Pending on VW's resolve, we may never purchase another. We are already contemplating switching manufacturers. We purchased under a promise but we've been bold faced lied to. That sucks. What else are they lying about? Roy Greyeyes, Ottawa, Canada @philinhongkong tweets being environmentally-friendly was not uppermost in his mind when he made his Volkswagen purchase: We have five Volkswagens in the household, two of which are diesel. They have provided safe, frugal, and reliable transport for my family. As cars to live with they are light years ahead of Vauxhalls and Fords which we used to run. As a loyal Volkswagen customer I am, as you'd expect very, very, very disappointed. The brains, the resources, and innovation of this company alone could not allow this to happen, but it did. However, if any organisation can turn it round from this debacle it will be this one. Chandrin Katuwawala, Bedfordshire, UK This afternoon we are seeing a VW dealer to close the deal for Passat which we viewed last week. We based the decision on how economical and environmentally friendly the car was. I don't know where it leaves us. Do we still go ahead or wait, in which case we will lose the special deal offered.

"According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT), sales fell to 153,000 units during the month, down about 3% year on year. It is an improvement on September, when there was a 20.5% decline. The new figures come as Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is to reopen its Solihull plant in the West Midlands after a two week shutdown. Grant worries The SMMT said there had been strong growth in alternative-fuelled vehicles (AFV), with combined plug-in hybrid and battery electric registrations up 30%. However, it warned that that government cuts to the Plug-in Car Grant could undermine future growth. Manufacturers are also worried about the potential risks of Brexit. They fear that an end to frictionless trade could disrupt their ""just-in-time"" supply chains, hurting production. JLR, the UK's biggest carmaker, had also blamed weakening global demand and falling diesel sales for its decision to pause production in Solihull from 22 October. Last week JLR said car sales had fallen sharply, taking it into a loss for the three months to October. Its revenues were £5.6bn on sales of 129,887 vehicles in the three months to the end of September. As a result JLR's parent company, Tata Motors, reported a net loss £110m for the quarter. Explaining the thinking behind the Solihull closure, where JLR makes Range Rover and Jaguar models, the firm said it wanted to achieve ""operational efficiencies"" and ""align supply to reflect fluctuating demand globally as required"". The shutdown came after a move to a three day week for 2,000 workers at the firm's Castle Bromwich plant and a promise in April to lay off 1,000 workers across its West Midlands' plants. The UK car industry has been struggling in recent months, as diesel sales fall and carmakers face tougher new emissions standards.","Sales of new cars in the UK recovered slightly in October, although they were still down on a year previously."
"""We will not be negotiating that away as part of a trade deal,"" she told the BBC. Her comments follow reports that negotiators are considering allowing imports of US products that do not meet UK standards. Boosting agricultural exports is a top US priority for a trade agreement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson drew outcry earlier this year, when he appeared to back away from a pledge to maintain bans on chlorinated chicken and hormone-treated beef in hopes of securing a treaty. And on Wednesday, farmers drove their tractors to Parliament Square in London to call for protection for the British farming industry and the current standards of food production in a post-Brexit economy. But on a visit to the Port of Southampton, Ms Truss denied the government would loosen the restrictions. ""It is against the law to import chlorinated chicken and hormone-injected beef and we will not be negotiating that away as part of a trade deal,"" she said. The UK is looking for a ""win-win"" deal that will make it easier for UK car manufacturers and others to sell to the US, she said. However, the UK will not be bullied into an agreement that does not serve its interests, she added. ""We're not going to be bounced into a deal by the US - we will take the time it needs to get a deal that suits the UK,"" she said. Ms Truss refused to comment on a leaked letter, in which she reportedly expressed concerns about the government's plans to phase in checks on EU goods coming into the UK after the Brexit transition period ends this year. She reportedly warned fellow ministers that failing to impose full border controls until July could lead to legal challenges at the World Trade Organization, increased smuggling, and even weaken the union with Northern Ireland. ""I'm absolutely confident we have the right plans in place for our border, and we'll be saying more about that in a few days"", she said. US-UK trade deal progress Robert Lighthizer, America's top trade negotiator, said at a video conference hosted by Chatham House on Thursday that he was optimistic the US and UK would reach a deal. However, he said the inability to meet in person due to coronavirus had slowed the talks. He warned there remained ""very significant issues that we have to come to grips with"". Alluding to the dispute over agricultural exports, Mr Lighthizer said that food safety standards in some cases were ""nothing more than thinly veiled protectionism"". Fears over chlorine-washed chicken and other US farming practices have been described by Woody Johnson, the US ambassador to the UK, as ""inflammatory and misleading"". Earlier this year, Mr Johnson said it was important that US beef and poultry should be allowed into the UK. He said the process was used by EU farmers to treat vegetables, and that it was the best way to deal with salmonella and other bacteria.",International Trade Secretary Liz Truss has denied the UK is preparing to water down its food safety standards in order to reach a trade deal with the US.
"Hilcorp will pay $5.6bn (£4.5bn) to buy all of BP's interests in the US state. The firm has faced pressure from environmental groups to stop drilling in the area, but BP said its decision was not connected to this. ""We have other opportunities that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy,"" BP's chief executive said. BP said the deal is part of its plans to raise $10bn over the next two years through asset sales to further strengthen its balance sheet. The extreme cold and remoteness of some of the drilling regions of Alaska makes it expensive for firms to operate there. BP's chief executive Bob Dudley said Hilcorp had the ability to ""maximise its [the business's] value for the State of Alaska."" Mr Dudley said the funds from the sale would enable BP to ""pursue new advantaged opportunities."" Prolific Prudhoe BP began working in Alaska in 1959, and in the mid-1970s helped build the 800-mile Trans Alaska Pipeline. The Prudhoe Bay oilfield in the state - in which BP has a 26% stake - is the most prolific oil field in US history, and has produced over 13 billion barrels of oil, with forecasts suggesting it has the potential to produce more than one billion further barrels. BP said about 1,600 employees were currently associated with its Alaskan business. It said it was ""committed to providing clarity about their future as soon as possible as part of the transition process with Hilcorp."" Mr Dudley said the decision to sell its Alaskan business did not diminish its commitment to drilling in the US. ""We remain very bullish on the US energy sector... and we will continue to look at further investment opportunities here,"" he said.",BP will no longer have any operations in Alaska after it agreed to sell its entire remaining business there to a private oil and gas firm.
"The Association for Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR) has written to Philip Hammond asking for more transitional relief for the sector. Business rates in England and Wales are being updated to take into account changes in property values. However, the government says a cap on how much bills can rise will cushion the impact for firms facing increases. The letter written by the ALMR on behalf of its members says that ""on average, the pub sector will see a 15% increase and restaurants a 23% increase across the country"". ""This will add a further £300m to £500m in additional cost in the hospitality sector,"" it says. The ALMR says the impact of the extra costs could threaten the positive contribution the sector is making to overall economic growth in the UK. The ALMR represents leading brands, including Pizza Express, Wagamama and Yo Sushi, as well as smaller businesses operating from only one or two premises. ""We would urge you to consider reviewing the transitional relief provisions and the introduction of sector specific hospitality retail relief,"" the letter says. How are business rates calculated? Rates are calculated by multiplying the rateable value of a property by a multiplier set by the government. But as property values change over time, rateable values need to be reassessed periodically - usually every five years. However this update to property values is two years behind schedule, making it a harder pill to swallow in areas where the price of real estate has been rising. A statement from the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said that most businesses will not face sharp rises in costs. ""Following the revaluation, three-quarters of properties will see no change or even a fall in their bills, and the small minority of businesses that face an increase will benefit from our £3.6bn transitional relief scheme,"" it said. However, property experts have predicted that some businesses, especially in thriving commercial centres and the south-east of England could see very dramatic changes to their rates bills, by as much as several hundred percent. Many pubs and restaurants occupy prime real estate in town and city centres. The DCLG added that many pubs had seen turnover increase significantly since the last rates valuation in 2010 as a result of the growth in casual dining. That increase in revenue would affect the rateable value of the property, it said. However the government's planned cap on annual increases means that bills will rise gradually over five years rather than all in one go, with greater protection provided for smaller businesses. The DCLG said that while some businesses will see their rates bill rise, others will see bills remain the same or even fall. Overall the rates upgrade is designed to be revenue neutral.",Pubs and restaurants are calling for the chancellor to dilute the impact of business rate rises due in April.
"The trader, who has been sacked, exploited weaknesses in the system to profit at a customer's expense, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. The incident occurred in June 2012, the day after the bank was fined a record £290m for attempting to rig Libor. Barclays said it ""very much regrets the situation"" that led to the fine. The FCA found the bank failed to ""adequately manage conflicts of interest between itself and its customers"", in relation to fixing the price of gold. ""Barclays has undertaken a significant amount of work to enhance our systems and controls and is committed to the highest standards across all of our operations,"" said Antony Jenkins, group chief executive. The FCA also fined the trader, Daniel James Plunkett, £96,500. ""A firm's lack of controls and a trader's disregard for a customer's interests have allowed the financial services industry's reputation to be sullied again,"" said Tracey McDermott, the FCA's director of enforcement and financial crime. ""Barclays' failure to identify and manage the risks in its business was extremely disappointing."" Barclays and Mr Plunkett agreed to settle at an early stage, thereby qualifying for a 30% discount on their fines. Fake orders Mr Plunkett was a director on the precious metals desk. He was responsible for pricing and managing Barclays' risk on a contract that was specifically linked to the price of gold at 3:00p.m. on 28 June 2012. If the gold price was above $1,558.96 (£925.57) at that time then Barclays would be required to make a payment of $3.9m to its customer. But if the price was below that benchmark Barclays would not have to make the payment. Mr Plunkett created fake orders with the intent of pushing the price of gold below $1,588.96, which he succeeded in doing. The result was Barclays was not obligated to make the $3.9m payment to its customer, and Mr Plunkett booked a profit of $1.75m for the bank. When the customer learned of this, an explanation was sought from Barclays. The concerns were then relayed to Mr Plunkett on 28 and 29 June 2012. The FCA said he misled both Barclays and the regulator by providing a false account of events and failing to admit that he had placed the fake orders. Gold Fixing is a price setting mechanism that allows investors to buy and sell gold at a single quoted price. Barclays joined the mechanism in 2004. The other members are HSBC, Societe Generale and Scotiabank. Deutsche Bank was part of the group but has since left.",Barclays Bank has been fined £26m by UK regulators after one of its traders was discovered attempting to fix the price of gold.
"By Matthew DaviesAfrica Business Report editor, Johannesburg Pravin Gordhan says allegations against him related to his time as head of South Africa's tax agency are wholly unfounded. Mr Gordhan says his legal team has advised him he is under no obligation to go to the police. South Africa's currency, the rand, had earlier fallen on speculation Mr Gordhan may be arrested. The Treasury confirmed Mr Gordhan had taken legal advice, having been contacted by the elite police unit, the Hawks. Questions By deciding to ignore its request to appear before it, Mr Gordhan is essentially telling the Hawks that he has already answered the questions they put to him. Also, he points out that the Hawks themselves said a few months ago that he was not a suspect in this matter. The rand had fallen more than 1% against the US dollar on Wednesday morning. Domestic bonds also fell as the cost of insuring debts in the credit default swaps market surged. Speculation has been rife that Mr Gordhan may be charged in connection with an alleged rogue spy unit that was set up at the tax collection agency when he headed it up between 1999 and 2009. Rumours of an arrest first emerged in local South African media back in May. Investigators sent Mr Gordhan a list of questions earlier this year, but he has always said the unit's work was above board and that he was unaware of any illegality connected with it. Downgrade risk The ongoing developments have raised investors' concerns over the leadership at the finance ministry of Africa's largest and most developed economy. In December last year, President Jacob Zuma sacked the then finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, replacing him with a little-known MP, David van Rooyen. Financial markets and the currency tumbled following that decision and President Zuma was forced to remove Mr van Rooyen as finance minister and offer the job to Mr Gordhan. It was the second time Mr Gordhan had accepted the job - he was the finance minister before Mr Nene. South Africa's economy is teetering on the brink of recession, having recorded a contraction in the first quarter of this year. Figures for the second quarter are due out in early September. Should they also show a contraction, the economy will be technically in a recession. The country narrowly avoided a downgrade to junk status recently and the ratings agencies are due to give another assessment by the end of the year. Shadow finance minister David Maynier, of the opposition Democratic Alliance, says the arrest of Mr Gordhan would ""shatter investor confidence, risk a sovereign ratings downgrade and be a disaster for the already fragile zero growth, zero jobs economy in South Africa"". Earlier this month, the performance of the ruling African National Congress in South Africa's local elections was its worst since the end of apartheid 22 years ago. Nuclear deal Many analysts are saying that these events are part of the political endgame by President Zuma to oust Mr Gordhan. The reason seems to be the continuing tension between the Treasury and the Presidency over a Zuma-backed plan to build several nuclear power stations at a cost of some $60bn. Mr Gordhan has not publicly opposed the deal, which Russian companies are favoured to win, but keeps re-iterating that South Africa will only sign deals it can afford. It's thought that one of the main reasons Nhlanhla Nene was shown the door was that he refused to sign off on the nuclear deal. If the goal is to replace Mr Gordhan with someone more amenable to signing the cheques for the nuclear deal, logically soon is the time to do it. For the past six months, the rand had been gaining significantly against the US dollar (having slumped following Mr Nene's sacking last December). But the economic growth forecasts for this year remain bad - at best 1%, probably closer to zero - while unemployment remains stubborn high at more than 25%. For many analysts, precious little has been achieved or is likely to be achieved by the end of the year, when the credit rating agencies may well downgrade South Africa's sovereign debt to junk status. Firing Mr Gordhan, or making him step aside, will no doubt cause a good deal of market turmoil.",South Africa's finance minister has said he will not appear before the police despite a request to do so.
"BP said that sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis have not affected the oil giant so far, but could do so in the future. The warning came as European ministers were meeting to discuss bolstered measures against Russia. Sanctions ""could adversely impact our business"", BP said. BP has around a 20% stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft. ""Any future erosion of our relationship with Rosneft, or the impact of further economic sanctions, could adversely impact our business and strategic objectives in Russia, the level of our income, production and reserves, our investment in Rosneft and our reputation,"" BP said. 'Cloud on the horizon' The company's second quarter replacement cost profits, which strip out volatility in oil prices, were $3.2bn (£1.9bn), up from $2.4bn in the same period last year. ""I think in the short term they'll be looking in particular at the effect [sanctions are] going to have on technology transfer to Russia,"" said Russian oil economy expert John Lough. ""But I think, more broadly, this is of course a cloud on the horizon for BP, because the crisis in Ukraine seems to be escalating rather than de-escalating,"" he told the BBC. European ministers are meeting in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss whether to impose further sanctions on Russia over allegations of its involvement in the ongoing crisis in Ukraine. Tensions have been heightened by the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which the UK believes was shot down by a missile ""supplied by the Russians"". Ukraine and pro-Russian rebels have each accused the other of shooting down the Boeing 777, killing 298 passengers. Mr Lough said sanctions could be ""ramped up"", and were likely to have an effect on the Russian economy. Bolstered European sanctions could include the prohibition of exports of technologies used in the Russian oil sector. For the second quarter, BP said higher oil production in higher-margin areas such as the Gulf of Mexico had boosted its profits. BP expects third quarter production to be lower than the second quarter due to ""planned major turnaround and seasonal maintenance activities in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico"".",BP has warned that further sanctions against Russia could affect its business as it posted a rise in second quarter profits.
"By John SudworthBBC News, Shanghai The mobile network growth here has been remarkable, with some 80 million new subscribers coming online every year for the past decade. But in some ways the real communications revolution has only just begun. This year, China will overtake America as the world's biggest smartphone market. And for many Chinese, the smartphone offers them their first personal route to access the internet - by some estimates 40% of those connecting to the web in China now do so solely via a mobile phone. That offers IT developers, and mobile phone app makers in particular, an extraordinary opportunity. 'No better place' In a small Shanghai office, with a few dozen employees beavering away at their computer screens, Guanxi.me is one startup company joining the gold rush. ""There's no better place to be than China,"" chief executive Alvin Wang tells me. ""There'll be an extra 200 million new smartphone users in the next 12 months. We want to be on those phones."" The app Alvin is developing allows users to build social networks and then, using geo-location data, track and meet those contacts in the real world. ""People are social animals but today's technology is more geared to replacing face-to-face contact. We want to enhance and increase face-to-face contact,"" Alvin says. Guanxi.me is free to download, and that's important in China. Here, smartphone users are much less likely to pay to download an app than their Western counterparts. Cheryl Wu is typical of many young smartphone users in China. She has a job in real estate and spends her evenings meeting and socialising with friends; posting, tweeting and messaging her way through her nights out using a series of apps on her smartphone. All of those apps, though, have been downloaded free of charge. She particularly likes the Weishin voicemail app she tells me, because it's fun, convenient and free. 'In-app' sales So how, then, do you make money as an app developer in China? One way is to try to target ""in-app"" sales; give away the app for free, get users hooked, and then sell them the chance to enhance their experience for a small fee. It's a model used most successfully by the bigger developers of mobile games technology and the idea is simple. Although users in China may be willing only to pay a few cents for the enhanced service, when you're talking millions of users, that can soon add up to a lot of money. But for non-gaming app developers, advertising revenue is the way forward, and July Cheng, a young mother based in Shanghai, is showing how easy it can be. Her home-made app, developed for her twins, has become a surprise overnight success with tens of thousands of downloads. For each one, July is paid a commission from the pop-up-ads linked to the app, and she now earns more than $1,000 a month this way. ""You just need one mobile phone, one PC and your good ideas,"" she tells me. The holy grail for app developers, though, may well be finding ways to hitch a ride on China's booming luxury brand sales. Apps like Guanxi.me have valuable social networking databases that could prove very attractive to high street retailers. Couple that with the phone's geo-location data, and suddenly the mobile phone offers advertisers a way to get personalised offers into the hands, or onto the smartphone screens, of customers at the moment they pass by the shop door. Copy cats This kind of technology is being developed in many markets, of course, but it is in China, with the sheer scale of the mobile market and the country's booming sales of luxury brands, that the opportunities might prove the most attractive. One major challenge remains however, and it's an old one: the country's notoriously weak protection for intellectual property. ""Once you start to become successful, your app will be copied,"" Michael Clendendin from industry analysts Red Tech Advisors tells me. ""I've no doubt about that, so the only way for you to survive in China is to try to pre-empt that by partnering with one of the bigger companies that might steal your app."" That will need to change if China is really going to unlock the creative potential offered by its ever growing mountain of mobile hardware. Guanxi.me's Alvin Wang thinks it will, in part because Chinese companies will themselves join the chorus of international voices demanding a strengthening of legal protection. ""It's going to take a little time, I'm not saying overnight this is going to be the oasis for intellectual property protection,"" he says. ""But over next five to 10 years, there will be an increasing awareness from government, and pressure from Chinese companies themselves, to make sure real innovation is protected.""","At some point in the past few months, China's billionth mobile phone customer switched on his or her handset for the first time."
"By Simon BrowningBBC News Eight months after the Boeing 737 Max crash that killed Ms Kuria's father, Joseph Waithaka, the site of impact was covered on Thursday and unidentified remains of the victims were buried in rows of identical coffins. But Ms Kuria wasn't there. Officials from Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are believed to have attended a ceremony at the site, but because of the short notice Ms Kuria and other relatives of the dead were unable to attend. Family members of three separate victims told the BBC they were only notified of the ceremony days ago. As a result, only relatives of two of the 157 victims attended. ""It is absurd. It makes me shudder that Boeing and Ethiopian Airlines are at my father's funeral and I'm not,"" Ms Kuria said. The crash happened in a rural area to the south-east of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It left behind a deep crater which until this week still contained accident debris and some human remains. Families of those killed say they were left horrified after they visited the site last month and found that recent rains had uncovered bones and other items. Some, they said, were floating in flood water in the crater. Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 was lost minutes after take-off on what should have been a routine flight from Addis Ababa to the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 10 March. It came down in farmland, in a deeply rural area. In the immediate aftermath, those human remains that could be found were removed, along with the plane's flight recorders and large items of wreckage. The crash is believed to have occurred after a flight control system known as MCAS deployed at the wrong time, forcing the nose of the aircraft down when the pilots were trying to gain height. A similar malfunction has been blamed for the loss of a near-identical 737 Max in Indonesia a year ago. The aircraft has been grounded for the past nine months, banned from flying by aviation authorities around the world. The violence of the impact of the Ethiopian Airlines flight meant that when my colleagues and I visited the site in May, there was still a great deal of smaller debris lying in the fields. The deep impact crater itself remained, alongside huge mounds of earth from the recovery operation, with a rough wooden fence the only barrier to access. Animals were able to roam freely across the site. There were no guards and no official presence. After that, the victims' relatives say, the situation worsened as a result of seasonal rains. They have been demanding action. Nadia Millieron, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died in the crash, recently told the BBC: ""There were bones being revealed all the time and local people are coming to the site and covering them. We want Ethiopian Airlines to move the piles of earth into the crater, take the unidentifiable remains into the crater and to cover everything"". Ethiopian Airlines, which is managing the site, told victims' families it was aware of the issue, but claimed insurance issues had prevented it from taking action. But after coming under pressure from the relatives, and following an investigation by the BBC, it appears those difficulties have now been overcome. On Thursday, rows of coffins were placed neatly in the crater. These contained remains that had previously been removed for forensic analysis, but which could not be identified due to contamination. Then they were covered over and the crater itself was filled, the dark earth matching the surrounding fields. The site is now a permanent grave. Relatives of the victims believe Ethiopian Airlines had a duty to keep them informed about the burial and should have given them more notice. The BBC has approached the carrier for a comment. Boeing has refused to comment on reports that one of its senior executives, Jennifer Lowe, was among those present. The company said in a statement: ""We continue to offer our deepest sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 and we are committed to helping those affected by these tragedies."" Last month, Ms Kuria travelled with her family to Ethiopia to collect and bring home some of her father's remains. She said it was ""heartbreaking"" that she was unable to get to the site in time for the covering of the site. ""My dad is being buried, well most of him, as we only received a small amount of him back,"" she said. She said she would have jumped on a flight if it had been possible. ""They've robbed us of our closure,"" she said.",Zipporah Kuria was fighting back tears.
"CME Group and CBOE Global Markets exchanges will offer investors Bitcoin futures from later this month. The move sent the crypto-currency's price up, continuing its volatile week. Bitcoin hit a record above $11,400 on Wednesday, but then lost 20% of its value in the following 24 hours. What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? The announcement from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that it will allow the futures to be traded was seen as a watershed moment for the currency. It means that investors will be able to buy and sell ""future"" contracts in Bitcoins - an agreement to buy the crypto-currency, for example, in three months time at a certain price. CME Group said trading would be available on its CME Globex electronic trading platform from 18 December. To guard against volatility, CME and CBOE will put in place stricter than usual risk-management safeguards. Bubble risk? CME and CBOE have also agreed to enter into data-sharing agreements, particularly on the settlement process, so the CFTC can conduct its own surveillance on the new financial contracts. Bitcoin's rapid rise from less than $800 in December last year to more than $11,000 this week on Coindesk has stoked fears that it is a pricing bubble that could leave recent investors worse-off. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a ""fraud"" at a conference in early September, while Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein has questioned whether the crypto-currency is a currency at all, given its volatile pricing. It ""doesn't feel like a store of value,"" he has said.","Bitcoin has taken another step toward the financial mainstream, after a US regulator said it would let two traditional exchanges begin trading in Bitcoin-related financial contracts."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance Reporter It is advising consumers not to buy the products, both of which are labelled as sun protection factor (SPF) 30. One of them is made by Boots; the other is sold under the Hawaiian Tropic brand. However, both companies rejected the claims made by Which? and said their sunscreens were fully effective. In the latest copy of its magazine, Which? said that both Soltan Protect and Moisturise Lotion (SP30) and Hawaiian Tropic Silk Hydration Lotion (SP30) offered only two-thirds of the skin protection they should. The SPF figure is designed to measure the amount of protection against harmful ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun - the main cause of sunburn. Both products passed the tests for ultraviolet A (UVA) rays, which are less dangerous, but more prevalent. 'Satisfactory' The product makers have both denied the claims. Hawaiian Tropic said all its sun tan lotions were rigorously tested, ""meeting all SPF, UVA and EU requirements and regulations"". Furthermore, it said its own tests suggested that its Silk Hydration and Satin Protection lotions ""exceed the label claims, even after 80 minutes in water"". Boots said it was confident that all its sun care products met the SPF labelling claims. ""Customers can rely on them to provide the level of protection expected,"" said a Boots spokesperson. Eleven other sunscreens examined by Which? - using British Standard Tests - were deemed to be satisfactory. It said own-brand products from Asda, Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's all offered the SPF that was claimed. The organisation is asking Boots and Hawaiian Tropic to improve their products so that they deliver better protection. How do sunscreens and lotions protect us? Philippa Roxby, Health reporter There is a huge range of different sun products available, including lotions, mousses, sprays, gels and creams. In general, they can use either organic or inorganic filters to absorb or reflect Ultraviolet rays. The terms 'sun lotions' and 'sunscreens' are used interchangeably to describe many of them. 'Suntan lotion' is sometimes used to refer to substances designed to accelerate tanning with little or no sun protection factor. Some people use the term 'sunblock' to refer to sunscreens that reflect rather than absorb UV rays. But what's more important than the name used is the product's protection qualities, which can be found on the label.

"By Paul JohnsonInstitute for Fiscal Studies Inequality in the housing market, poverty among working people and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are among them. For any party hoping to win power on 12 December, these are serious issues. Fewer young people own homes Only 36% of those born in the late 1980s have become homeowners by the age of 30, compared with 55% or more of those born between the 1940s and the 1970s. Younger generations have seen the price of homes rise far more quickly than their salaries - the main reason for this change. This is particularly true in southern England. Many more people in their 20s and 30s are now renting privately. Their average housing costs are about 20% higher than 20 years ago. Meanwhile, low interest rates mean most owner-occupiers - many of them older people - enjoy lower housing costs than in the past. Wages are £5,000 less than they might have been Growth in productivity - the amount the UK's workers produce per hour worked - has been unprecedentedly poor since the 2008 financial crisis. In the past 11 years, the amount workers produce every hour has grown by just 2.9%. That's about as much as it grew on average every 15 months in the preceding 40 years. As a result, productivity in the UK is now 19% lower than it would have been had the trend seen before 2008 continued. This really matters. In the long-run, average living standards grow in line with growth in productivity. Average hourly wages are roughly at the same level now as they were in 2008. Given they usually rise every year, this means they are also 19% below where they would have been had long-term trends continued. A full-time worker on average hourly wages now earns £5,000 a year less than they would have done had the pre-2008 trend continued. Poverty among people who are working Low wages have had another knock-on effect - most people living in poverty in the UK are actually in working households. In 2017-18, 58% of all those below the poverty line (less than £248 a week income for a couple with no children) were either in paid work or living in a household with someone who worked. This figure compares with 41% two decades ago. In part, this reflects positive trends. There are fewer households where nobody works, and pensioner incomes have increased. But it also reflects the fact for low-income workers, wages are not growing as fast as housing costs. An ageing population As the UK's ageing population grows, so does the amount of money the UK spends on pensions and healthcare. In the past 30 years, spending on these areas has increased from 8.5% of national income to 13.1% - in other words, a rise of £100bn. It's estimated this figure will have to increase by 1.7% of national income (£37bn in today's terms) over the next 10 years. This is just to keep pace with changes in the population and other cost pressures. That will mean big tax rises, or spending cuts, just to keep things broadly as they are. Problems with tax The UK government currently takes nearly 35p in tax from every £1 earned - the highest share it's taken since the 1940s. Given the ageing population, and the various spending promises being made by the main parties, this is unlikely to go down any time soon. Having said that, many European countries raise more in taxes. But they tend to raise more from people on average incomes. The UK, on the other hand, tends to rely on a small number of high earners for a lot of the tax it raises. The highest-income 1% of adults pay more than a third of all income tax. The problem with this is that public finances are more vulnerable to changes in the income or behaviour of high earners. If a relatively small number leave the UK, this can have a outsized effect on taxes. The amount of money raised is also under threat because tax levels on petrol and diesel have not been maintained. And it can be difficult to raise tax from multinational companies. More like this Going for zero The main parties all say they want to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. While progress has been good so far (the UK's domestic emissions are 44% down on their 1990 level), the UK is still nowhere near meeting the target. According to the Committee on Climate Change, radical changes are needed in the next few years. By 2025, it says, the UK should have a plan to completely replace gas as a source of domestic heating. By the early 2030s, all new cars and vans sold should be electric. One of the economic challenges here is the less well-off spend more of their income on heating and transport costs. Any taxes targeting the carbon people produce need careful consideration to avoid making some worse off.

"By Sarah FinleyTechnology of Business reporter Peter Lane, a 21-year-old who graduated last summer from Cardiff University with a degree in History, is hoping to get into business consulting. He's applied for 55 jobs and secured around 15 interviews, but believes technology has hindered rather than helped his search. The interviews weren't what he was expecting. ""They were all video-based screening interviews - I didn't even meet my potential employers,"" Peter tells the BBC. ""There was no way to tell if I'd impressed them with my answers or experience as there was no human interaction."" Automated rejection letters were another issue for Peter, who is currently doing an unpaid internship at Solent's NHS Trust. ""Only 10% of potential employers have given me detailed feedback,"" he says. ""As jobseekers, we need to know where and how we can improve - whether that's with our CVs, job experience or even personality."" But this is the new world of tech-driven recruitment - and we'd better get used to it. Hiring and firing is a time-consuming and costly business, so firms are trying to automate as much of it as possible. And AI is being touted as the answer to almost every corporate recruitment prayer. ""AI helps reduce those unconscious and conscious biases in recruitment practices by removing common tendencies, like hiring those similar to you and first impressions,"" maintains Elle Robinson from management consultancy Kiddy & Partners. ""By observing speech, tone and facial movements in filmed interviews, well-programmed algorithms can both speed up the recruitment process and more objectively determine suitable candidates based on the core criteria for a role."" The key phrase there is ""well-programmed"". What if the algorithms themselves are biased? ""Relying on technology alone is inadequate,"" believes Neil Griffiths, consultant at executive search firm Korn Ferry. ""Like humans, robots are not fully objective in their judgements, and have been known to exhibit the prejudice of those who have programmed them. ""Analysing historical data, machines can be oblivious to societal developments and crucial shifts in thinking. Consequently, a partnership of human and robot in the recruitment process ensures a more nuanced outcome."" Jobseeker websites have certainly made it easier for employers and prospective employees to find each other, and computers can sift through CVs very fast, whittling down the number of suitable applicants based on keywords associated with the job role. Computers never get tired either and are consistent in their approach - unlike humans. ""Employers don't have time to check the credibility and assess the skills of every potential candidate,"" says Chris Butt, founder and chief executive of Cognisess, a predictive analytics company. ""Our system creates a digital profile of not just data from their CV, but their responses via assessments and video interviews. ""It analyses facial cues, body language and even how you speak. It then assesses whether the data collected from your CV is not only true, but also how good a fit for the role you are."" Bold claims indeed. But what if, like most of us, you're a bit nervous during the interview and not acting naturally? ""The machines learn to differentiate between typical and abnormal human behaviour, so they can recognise if candidates are being nervous and they can take this into consideration and will adapt the algorithms to account for this,"" says Mr Butt. But can an algorithm really know if a CV is truthful? More than a third of us have exaggerated our work experience, finds Xref, a reference checking platform, while more than a quarter mould their CVs to suit the roles they're applying for, hoping recruiters won't have time to check references. Gemma, 23, a graduate, is currently looking for employment and admits to slightly embellishing her CV. ""When you've got the same experience as thousands of other job graduates you need to make sure your CV stands out from the millions of others that employers get every day,"" she says. More Technology of Business ""I've only slightly amended my CV, but it could be the difference between getting in front of a potential employer or not."" Xref believes that the only way to tell if candidates are telling fibs is to take up those references employers usually ask for but often have no time to check properly. ""No CV, social media profile, criminal check or interview is as powerful as a legitimate reference detailing lived experience,"" says Lee-Martin Seymour, Xref co-founder and chief executive. The Sydney-based company has taken the slow, traditionally manual process of collecting references from previous employers and streamlined it, using a secure online platform. Xref asks candidates' referees for feedback then analyses the language they use, looking for positive, neutral and negative sentiment. Similarly, temping agency Flexy saw an opportunity in the rapidly-changing temporary job market and started to use a combination of psychological profiling, data analytics and machine learning to match up reliable casual workers with the right companies. ""Utilising data to provide trends and feedback is a powerful tool within the temporary staffing market, as it's important workers are efficient, reliable and trustworthy,"" says Oliver Crofton, Flexy's managing director. Technology may make hiring people faster and easier for companies, but it is not an end in itself, argues Raj Mukherjee, senior vice-president of product at jobseekers' website Indeed. The human element should not get lost in the mix. ""AI-powered technology gives recruiters back the time to make human connections, transforms the jobseeker experience, and ultimately, helps match talent to roles,"" he says. But for applicants like Peter Lane, it is actually making the job-hunting process more impersonal and confusing.","As companies rely more on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to find the right job candidates, is recruitment in danger of losing that personal touch?"
"QE was introduced as an emergency measure during the financial crisis to pump money directly into the financial system and keep banks lending. A decade later, the stimulus policies are still in place, but he said they have ""made the world more resilient"". But he also said gaps in understanding these relatively new tools remain. As the economic recovery in the eurozone gathers pace, investors are watching closely for when the ECB will ease back further on its 60bn euro (£55bn) a month bond-buying programme. Central bankers, including Mr Draghi, are meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, later this week, where they are expected to discuss how to wind back QE without hurting the economy. On Monday, a former UK Treasury official likened the stimulus to ""heroin"" because it has been so difficult to wean the UK, US and eurozone economies off it. In a speech in Lindau, Germany on Wednesday, Mr Draghi defended QE and the ECB's policy of forward guidance on interest rates. ""A large body of empirical research has substantiated the success of these policies in supporting the economy and inflation, both in the euro area and in the United States,"" he said. The ECB buying relatively safe assets such as government bonds means that banks can lend more and improve access to credit for riskier borrowers, Mr Draghi said. He added: ""Policy actions undertaken in the last 10 years in monetary policy and in regulation and supervision have made the world more resilient. But we should continue preparing for new challenges."" 'Heroin' Critics of QE argue it has inflated asset bubbles and stoked inequality by rewarding the asset-rich while punishing savers. Lord Macpherson, who was permanent secretary to the Treasury when the Bank of England started QE in 2009, tweeted on Monday: ""QE like heroin: need ever increasing fixes to create a high. Meanwhile, negative side effects increase. Time to move on."" The Bank of England's balance sheet swelled to £500bn last year, while the US Federal Reserve held $4.2 trillion (£3.3tn) of assets - which it is now looking to cut down. The ECB's massive bond-buying programme, which started in March 2015, is expected to top 2tn euros by the year end. Mr Draghi's comments came as a survey showed continued eurozone businesses growth in August, raising further questions about how much longer the stimulus is needed. The fastest rise in manufacturing exports in six-and-a-half years helped to offset a mild slowdown in services growth, according to the Eurozone Composite Purchasing Managers' Index.",European Central Bank President Mario Draghi has said unconventional policies like quantitative easing (QE) have been a success both sides of the Atlantic.
"It began with a young couple, an idea born over lazy days at the beach and two sewing machines. Swimwear brand Salinas started making its first bikinis at a home-factory in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 30 years ago, opened its first shop in 1990 and today is one of Brazil's leading bikini brands. It has 45 shops around the country and sells to 39 different countries. Its bikinis have been on covers of magazines like Vogue and Sports Illustrated, and dressed the likes of Madonna and Naomi Campbell. Rio-born Jacqueline and Antonio De Biase were still a young couple thinking about their future in the early 1980s. She used to work as a model and considered becoming a veterinarian; he had just graduated in architecture - and they both spent a lot of time hanging out with friends on the beach. ""Back then, we girls used to improvise a lot to make our own bikinis, because we still didn't have this bikini industry. The ones we had were very traditional, they came from the 1960s, from the two-piece swimsuit"", remembers Jacqueline. The couple decided to invest their savings in starting up a company making the types of bikinis their friends would want to wear. Pulling the strings ""The first thing I did was undo a bikini to see what came out: thread, Lycra and elastic. So I knew that's what I'd need to put one back together again,"" says Jacqueline. Along with two sewing assistants she set up a home-factory in a small house her grandmother had lent her in Santa Teresa, a quiet residential neighbourhood on Rio's hilltops. In a year's time they were able to make a living from the company's initial revenue. After three years they were producing around 2,000 bikinis a month. At first they sold the items to other shops that would stamp their own logos on them. They then started developing the brand's own image, reinvesting their profits to make the fledgling company grow. Today, 425 people work for Salinas in Rio. In 2007, it joined with a men's clothing brand from the same city, Richards, and three years later they both became part of InBrands, a holding that invests in the fashion industry. While InBrands manages the business, taking care of finances and all operational issues, she worries about patterns, models, fabrics, style, trends. ""Today, Salinas is very big. It's very different"", says Jacqueline. ""I began doing everything by myself, drawing without knowing how to draw, designing without knowing how to design, directing without knowing how to direct. It was all very experimental at the time, based on trial and error."" Drawing inspiration Salinas's creative office is the experimental laboratory where Jacqueline and her team develop each new bikini model. It occupies the third floor of an old industrial brick building shared with Richards and other brands. There is colour everywhere: In shelves crammed with samples of different fabrics, in panels on the walls where assortments of patterns are displayed and in racks with body-shaped hangers adorned with bikinis and other clothing items. Bikinis are still the flagship product, but over time Salinas started making clothing and accessories for the beach such as hats, sandals, shirts and dresses, which today represent about 30% of current production. It has also started making lingerie and Speedo-style swimsuits for men. Booming Brazil The company has grown by 60% since 2008, fuelled by internal expansion in Brazil which is now the world's sixth biggest economy. But the global financial crisis made the company reconsider its international expansion plans. The Brazilian currency - the real - is strong, and this has been taking its toll on sales abroad, she says. ""The world out there is taking a break, so this is not a moment to force an expansion"", says Jacqueline. On the other hand, she says, ""things in Brazil are booming... from 2007 until now, we've doubled the number of shops we have here"". But opening a business in Brazil can be difficult, she adds. ""There is still lots of bureaucracy, although it has been worse, and taxes are very high. That doesn't make things easier for businesses that are starting up,"" says Jacqueline. ""Sometimes there are incentives for small companies, but then you either have to be really small in order to have this benefit or really large so that these expenses are distributed within the business."" Jacqueline will turn 50 next February. She has seen bikinis grow skimpy, then larger again; become thongs or look like shorts; gain laces, knots and ruffles. The one constant, she says, is the unease some women feel when looking at the mirror trying to pick the right bikini to hide their imagined flaws - even if she is the only one to spot them. ""The trick is observing a lot and understanding that every detail can make a difference when our customer tries on a bikini. We have to have all the differences in a woman's body in mind when developing a collection"", she says.","What makes an entrepreneur? BBC Brasil's Julia Carneiro and Tom Santorelli hear from Jacqueline De Biase, 49, who started making her own bikinis at home as a teenager and now runs one of Brazil's leading bikini brands."
"Replacement vehicles cost consumers as much as £180m a year through higher premiums, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. There will also be a ban on website deals which stop insurers offering lower product prices elsewhere. No-claims bonus information will also have to be clearer, the regulator said. Courtesy car costs for an insurer can be significantly higher if the replacement car is provided by an outside company, rather than by the insurer itself, the CMA said. Ultimately, these costs are passed onto the consumer through higher premiums, and so should be capped at source, it added. ""There are over 25 million privately registered cars in the UK and we think these changes will benefit motorists who are currently paying higher premiums as a result of the problems we've found,"" said Alasdair Smith, chair of the CMA private motor insurance investigation group. A cap would be set by a panel of independent assessors. Investigations Deals between price comparison websites and insurers called ""price parity"" agreements should also be banned, the regulator proposed. The deals stop insurers offering their products more cheaply elsewhere, and again ultimately push up the price of insurance, CMA found. ""We believe they [price comparison websites] are great in helping motorists look for the best deal, and this in turn has driven insurers to compete more intensely, but we want to see an end to clauses which restrict an insurer's ability to price its products differently, whether on different price comparison sites or on other channels,"" Mr Smith said. A proposed ban would need to be confirmed in a final report from the CMA in September, and it would take ""several months"" for it to come into force. Rod Jones, insurance expert at price comparison website Uswitch.com, said: ""We welcome anything that helps ensures consumers get a fair deal. We will follow any recommended course of action that enables this."" The CMA has been studying the £11bn private motor insurance market following concerns raised by the Office of Fair Trading in September 2012. The report was welcomed by the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) as ""encouraging"". ""We have long-argued that some practices in the motor market, such as anti-competitive parity agreements, are detrimental to customers. [These] proposals will be beneficial to customers,"" said BIBA chief executive, Steve White. The investigation is separate to inquiries into exaggerated whiplash claims and insurance fraud. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Justice said lawyers would be banned from offering cash or free tablet computers to persuade people to bring injury claims. The courts would also be required to throw out claims which were exaggerated.","The cost of courtesy cars should be capped to push down car insurance premiums, the competition regulator has proposed."
"By Tim WeberBusiness editor, BBC News website, Davos, Switzerland Lacking a big theme, this year's meeting of the rich and powerful focused on global threats, from political turmoil to scarce resources. European leaders used the stage in Davos to drive home their message that they will do anything to save the euro. And the UK and Gates Foundation joined forces in a push to eradicate polio. Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK government would double its funding for the fight against the debilitating disease to $60m (£38m) despite the ""tough economic times"". The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, meanwhile, will add $100m in funding. ""There is an incredible opportunity to wipe out the last 1% of polio, saving lives now and preventing the threat of outbreaks in the future."" Guarded optimism In 2009 and 2010, the annual meetings of more than 2,000 of the world's most powerful business leaders and politicians had been gloomy affairs, as the credit crunch was followed by a global economic crisis. This year, company bosses showed plenty of optimism, but always tempered by warnings that the good times might not last. Chanda Kochhar, chief executive of Indian bank ICICI, said that while it was important to look for optimism and opportunities, this had to be grounded in reality. ""We are optimistic, but we are afraid to be optimistic,"" said Paul Bulcke, boss of food giant Nestle. Ellen Kullman, chief executive of DuPont, agreed, but acknowledged that 2010 had been ""a fantastic year for growth, and 2011 will still be good."" Whoever one spoke to, whether it was Michael Dell, founder of the computer giant carrying his name, Kris Gopalakrishnan of IT services firm Infosys or Wei Jiafu of China Ocean Shipping Group: everybody reported really strong growth and predicted investments and expansion. One banker, at a private meeting, spoke of ""boom times"". A survey of bosses from around the world, compiled by accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers and published at the eve of the Forum, suggested that confidence levels were back to pre-crisis levels. Despite this, many of the discussions and sessions held during the five days of the forum focused on what could go wrong. Government debt, especially in Europe, soaring inflation, especially for food, and scarce resources from food to energy, and cyber threats were all on the long list of worries that dominated the Davos agenda. Eurozone strength Davos was set for a vigorous debate about the health of the eurozone, or rather the lack thereof. However, this was somewhat squashed when French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched a clearly co-ordinated pincer attack on speculators, bankers and investors to tell them in no uncertain terms that they would do anything that was necessary to defend the euro and prop up weaker members of the currency union. With the back-up of the region's central bankers, who made forceful statements in private sessions for leaders of the banking industry, they appeared to calm the nerves of most. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou, meanwhile, also sat through a succession of meetings to make the case that the eurozone crisis had been contained and that Greece was on the way to recovery. ""The Sarkozy and Merkel statements put the markets at ease, put me at ease,"" said Jacob Wallenberg, chairman of Investor AB, the giant Swedish holding company. Still, there was some scepticism. ""The eurozone is still a high risk area in 2011... another sovereign debt crisis is possible, and [government] deficit reduction will have a negative impact on economic growth,"" warned Wei Jiafu. Egypt on the mind As so often during the annual meetings in Davos, an outside crisis forced its way on to the agenda, the turmoil spreading through North Africa, from Tunisia to Egypt. A hastily organised session featured two of the technocrats now in ministerial positions in Tunisia's interim government, and throughout the hallways participants swapped the latest news from the unrest in Cairo's streets. However, with few Arab leaders in attendance this year, the discussions lacked the heft that the Davos event used to provide during previous crisis. The rise and rise of India and China If this year's Davos served one purpose, then it was confirmation of the fact that India and China are now fully grown players on the world stage, both politically and economically. Discussions at Davos at times appeared to measure the health of the global economy by the strength of growth in both countries. Both countries had sent strong delegations to the forum, with neither politicians nor business leaders reluctant to assert their strength and authority.","The World Economic Forum has ended with business and political leaders worrying whether the economic boom in Asia, Brazil, the US and Germany can last."
"By Tim McDonaldBusiness reporter, BBC News It was also a huge moment for the airlines, particularly Qantas and Air New Zealand. Most airlines have muddled through a bruising pandemic year with a combination of private capital injections, government support and strong demand for freight services. The industry's more optimistic voices hope that the bubble could foreshadow a much better year ahead for the Asia-Pacific region's battered airline sector. Reason for celebration For Australia's Qantas, which lost A$1.03bn ($800m ; £570m) and saw its revenues plummet by 75% in the second half of 2020, the bubble is a glimmer of the light at the end of the tunnel. 630 employees from Qantas and its budget carrier Jetstar have returned to work to help operate the roughly 200 flights each week planned between the two countries. Monday's flights were full, and the two airlines expect to consistently fly at around 80% of capacity with those numbers increasing as the New Zealand ski season approaches. Already, Qantas had started to bounce back domestically, and predicts that both of its carriers will exceed pre-Covid volumes within Australia next year. It's also great news for Air New Zealand, which rehired 300 staff for the trans-Tasman flights, which make up around a third of its business. ""Pre-COVID, Australia was New Zealand's largest tourism market, with Air New Zealand bringing in roughly 400,000 Australians per year, so it's an incredibly important market for us and we're just thrilled to have the bubble up and running,"" said Air New Zealand's Chief Executive Greg Foran in an email. In fact, the bubble has been encouraging enough for Air New Zealand to hit pause on a capital raise to reassess how much it might need. The way forward The bubble is a reason for hope for the aviation industry for the wider region, according Subhas Menon, the Director General of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). ""It is the first bilateral travel bubble without any quarantine requirements. And of course it has been a long time coming but it is a model that can be emulated across the globe,"" he said. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce agrees. ""There's clearly a lot of countries in the region, particularly the Asia-Pacific region, that have high control over Covid. Not to the extent of Australia and New Zealand, but they give us opportunities, markets like Singapore, markets like Japan, markets like Taiwan. We're also actively looking at the Pacific Islands because there is real opportunity for places like Fiji, the Pacific Islands to open up which we think there is a huge demand for. So they all fall into that category,"" he said. A burst bubble? But reopening travel - even in a bubble - is clearly not easy. Within a day of the travel bubble opening, a cleaner at Auckland airport who had been fully vaccinated tested positive for Covid-19. Quickly, the New Zealand authorities pointed out that the case was not directly related to the bubble, adding that they expected a few cases, and it wouldn't end the new travel arrangements. ""When we opened, on both sides, we of course knew we would continue to have cases connected to our border,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said. Still, if that case had been more difficult to trace or there were more unconnected cases, flights could have easily been suspended. One airline, Virgin Australia, is so worried about the possibility of disruption that it plans to wait until October to join in the bubble. It's not an idle concern - other bubbles have been deflated even before they began. Last year, a proposed bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong was postponed just a few day before it opened due to a sudden spike in Hong Kong. Even within Australia there have been more than 120 changes to state border restrictions since the beginning of the pandemic. Digital solutions Mr Menon said almost every country has taken a different approach to containing Covid, and there needs to be more consistency. ""This virus is too difficult to predict, but what is even more difficult to predict is the reaction of government"" he said. The AAPA has been urging governments to try to harmonise their travel requirements to facilitate airline travel, preferably using digital solutions. A number of airlines, including Air New Zealand, have signed up to trial a new vaccine passport developed by the International Air Transport Association. Mr Menon says the digital passport, and other solutions like it, could help to build trust so that governments are confident enough to reopen their borders. The bubble ahead If Qantas hopes more travel bubbles might help to reopen international travel, others aren't as optimistic. Australia and New Zealand were both quite successful in containing the virus, but it required both both countries to close off their borders for more than a year, with international arrivals required to go through a two-week hotel quarantine at their own expense. Australia has recorded just over 29,500 virus cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began, while New Zealand has had just over 2,200 confirmed cases and 26 deaths. ""I'm not sure how many other countries are going to be able to do exactly what New Zealand and Australia have done with the bubble. That's because there aren't all that many other countries that have adopted an elimination strategy for COVID-19 - most have gone for containment,"" Mr Foran said.",The reopening of quarantine-free travel between Australia and New Zealand this week was a joyful occasion for the many families and friends who were finally reunited.
"The banker, who can not be named for legal reasons, is the first person in the UK to plead guilty to the offence. Two men have already pleaded guilty in the US to fraud offences linked to the rigging of Libor, for years the benchmark by which trillions of pounds of financial contracts are based. The case arose from the Serious Fraud Office's (SFO) investigations. It began looking into Libor manipulation in 2012 after it emerged that it was being widely abused by leading banks to manipulate rates in their favour. New laws The economic secretary to the Treasury, Andrea Leadsom, said: ""The integrity of the City matters to the economy of Britain. Ensuring that the key rates that underpin financial markets are robust, and that anyone who seeks to manipulate them is subject to the full force of the law is vital."" The government started consulting on new laws to ensure that markets are fair two weeks ago. It would like to create a new criminal offence for the attempted manipulation of Libor, and extend any new legislation to cover seven other major financial benchmarks. The SFO's investigation continues and 11 other individuals stand charged and await trial. Seven banks and brokerages have settled regulatory allegations of interest rate rigging in the UK and the US after global investigations. So far, 17 men have been charged with fraud-related offences. Last month, Lloyds Banking Group dismissed eight staff members following an investigation into the behaviour of its rate setters. The move follows the bank's £218m fine in July for ""serious misconduct"" over the setting of Libor.",A senior banker from a UK bank has admitted conspiring to defraud over manipulating the Libor lending rate.
"The Women and Equalities Committee is calling for a German-style system, where it is harder to make women redundant during and after pregnancy. The number of expectant and new mothers forced to leave their jobs has almost doubled to 54,000 since 2005, it said. The government said it would consider the recommendations carefully. In Germany, from the beginning of pregnancy until four months following childbirth, employers can only dismiss an employee in very rare cases - such as the company going bust - and it needs government approval to do so. In the UK, although it is illegal to dismiss a woman for reasons relating to having a child, a company can find other reasons for making her redundant. 'Unacceptable discrimination' Other recommendations from the report include more protection for casual, agency and zero-hours workers - such as making it easier for women to attend antenatal appointments. It also suggested a ""substantial reduction"" in the £1,200 fee for women taking a pregnancy-related discrimination case to an employment tribunal - and recommended the three-month limit on taking cases to a tribunal should be doubled to six months. 'Hugely stressful process' Sarah, an expectant mum who works for the NHS, said: ""I have been treated so poorly I've had to consider leaving. I've had various issues with obtaining equipment my employers have identified I need resulting in me sitting on a broken chair for two months of my pregnancy. ""I've been to occupational health and my managers, and was advised to ""go off sick"" until my maternity leave starts even though my baby is not due for another three months."" Another mum, who is seven months pregnant and was facing the threat of redundancy said: ""I have spent around two months of my pregnancy fighting my employer. I have been successful, but have very little confidence that when I return to work they will offer me my current job, never mind any flexibility - and I work in a female-dominated industry. ""Having gone through what I have just done, I don't think law changes will help at all. There was almost no support I could get that would actually help me keep my job. ""I had to have time off work and was crying every day. I love my job, but now I don't want to work for the managers who did this to me. ""But I do want other women to know that you can win on your own. It's hard work and emotionally draining, but it can be done."" The report cited research from the former Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which found that 11% of women reported being either dismissed, made redundant when others in their workplace were not, or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their job. ""There are now record numbers of women in work in the UK,"" said the committee's chairwoman, Maria Miller. ""The economy will suffer unless employers modernise their workplace practices to ensure effective support and protection for expectant and new mums."" She added that the government's approach had lacked ""urgency and bite"" and that the work to combat this ""unacceptable discrimination"" needed to be underpinned by concrete targets and changes to laws. 'Outdated attitudes' The report also called for government assurances that rights and protections would not be eroded, given the uncertainty following the vote to leave the European Union. Business Minister Margot James said: ""It is completely unacceptable that pregnant women and new mothers are apparently being forced to quit their jobs because of outdated attitudes. ""Tackling this issue is a key priority of mine and this government and I would like to thank the committee for its important work. We will consider its recommendations carefully and respond in due course."" What are your rights? The law says it is discrimination to treat a woman unfavourably - for example, not giving her a promotion or reducing pay - because she's pregnant or has recently given birth. This protection lasts from when you become pregnant to the end of your maternity leave. If you think you have a case: Claire Dawson, head of employment at law firm Slater and Gordon, said the company regularly acts for clients who have been made redundant while on or shortly after returning from maternity leave. ""The last thing they want to do at this time in their lives is engage in a legal battle and in many cases, they simply can't afford to,"" she added. Angela Rayner, shadow minister for women and equalities, said the report shows thousands of pregnant women are being ""priced out of justice"" because of tribunal fees introduced by the government. Former Liberal Democrat equalities minister Jo Swinson, now chairwoman of the charity Maternity Action, said too often companies were using pregnancy as an ""excuse to get rid of someone"". Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said it was a ""confusing landscape"" that meant ""some bad bosses"" were ""getting away with treating their employees unfairly"". Last week, a study for the Institute for Fiscal Studies showed that the earning power between men and those women returning to work after having a child becomes steadily wider. Over the subsequent 12 years, women's hourly pay rate falls 33% behind men's.","""Urgent action"" is needed to give pregnant women and new mothers more protection at work after a ""shocking"" increase in discrimination, MPs say."
"Food price inflation was 4.9% in June, compared with 3.2% in May, with rising pork prices partly to blame. While the headline inflation number was above analysts' expectations, it remains below the government's target figure of 3.5%. Analysts say the latest figure reduces the prospect of interest rate cuts in 2013. Cutting interest rates risks inflating a property bubble, while tightening may put additional pressure on the economy in the middle of the current global economic uncertainty. Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists Lu Ting and Zhi Xiaojia expect authorities to keep monetary policy neutral with ""neither easing nor tightening"". China expects economic growth this year to be 7.5% - which would be the slowest rate in 23 years for the country. The government is due to release data on gross domestic product for the second quarter of the year on 15 July.","China's inflation rate rose by more than expected in June, increasing to 2.7% from 2.1% the month before."
"By Nic Mitchell . The rise of universities teaching in English, rather than their own local language, has become a global phenomenon. These are not only appealing to the world's five million international students who travel abroad, they are also being chosen by students staying in their own countries who prefer to study in English rather than their own language. The research is from a Dutch-based organisation, StudyPortals, which has a database of information on 100,000 bachelor and masters' degrees at over 2,100 universities around the world. It provides a starting point for people looking to ""find a way through the maze for globally minded students"", says StudyPortals' Carmen Neghina. Competing for students The mapping project has also looked at a group of 1,000 universities at the top of international rankings, and has found that more than three quarters of these offer at least one or more degrees taught entirely in English. These will include universities that are in English-speaking countries, including the US and UK, but Ms Neghina says there are now 72,000 different English-taught courses on offer to students from these leading universities. The Netherlands has the most degrees taught entirely in English on the European mainland, with 12 universities included in this ranking offering a total of over 1,000 courses taught in English. Germany has 54 top universities in this ranking, with over 835 English-taught courses for international students. Sweden has 12 universities listed with 550 courses in English; Denmark has seven universities listed with 482 programmes in English and Spain has 27 universities with 426 courses. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch This is more than a European trend. Of the 112 top universities identified in China, 45 offer one or more English-language degrees, as do 20 in Taiwan, 11 in Japan and six in Thailand. Students opting for English The rising numbers of students studying abroad could drive this trend even further. Hans de Wit, director of the Center for International Higher Education, Boston College in the US, says there are predictions that by 2025 the number of international students could have risen to eight million. The largest numbers of international students come from China, India and South Korea, but Nigeria is catching up fast. English-speaking countries together with Germany and France attract most of them. But Dr de Wit has forecast that their ""market share is under threat due to increasing competition from other countries, including China"". Within Europe, according to the Academic Co-operation Association, the number of university courses taught in English in non-English-speaking countries has increased by more than 300% in seven years. The highest concentration is in Denmark, where 38% of university programmes are English-taught courses. In the Netherlands it is 30%, Sweden 24% and Finland at 23%. The proportion of English-taught courses in Germany is just under 6% of the total programmes available. In France and Italy it remains a much lower proportion, about 3%. And in Turkey it is lower still at about 2%. English at home Such courses don't just attract international students. They are also popular with home students, particularly at masters' level, who want to gain an English language qualification alongside international students without leaving their own country. According to the ACA's report, about 45% of those on English-taught university programmes in mainland Europe were studying in their own countries. In about one in 20 courses, there were only domestic students enrolled in these English-taught degrees. There was a trend for courses in the Baltic countries and south-eastern Europe to have more domestic students learning through English, while English-taught courses in Nordic and western European countries tended to have more international students. But the pattern for English courses being more popular at postgraduate level is not universal. ""In most countries, English-taught masters' degrees are more common, but not in South Africa and China which may be worth looking at for those wanting a bachelors' degrees taught in English, as well as a cultural adventure,"" said Ms Neghina. There are also five-year courses in which the first three years might be taught in the home language, such as Swedish, with two postgraduate years taught in English - so that any local students will have to study for part of the time in English. Edwin van Rest, chief executive of StudyPortals, said students looking to study abroad need to understand what's on offer: ""Choosing a new study programme without knowing your options is like buying a house, but only looking at your own neighbourhood.""","There are now almost 8,000 courses being taught in English by leading universities in non-English speaking countries, according to a project mapping their expansion."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter, BBC News A raft of reports and statistics over recent days suggest that they have much to be grateful for. More and more twenty-somethings continue to live with their parents, and others require help to raise money to buy a home. The financial pressures of families are leading some parents to continue to work beyond state pension age. But rather than simply sponging off their parents, data suggests these are tough times for young adults to set out on their own. Home truths Charlotte Davis, a 28-year-old professional working in the charity sector in London, recently told the BBC that rent rises had led her to move home every year since 2008. ""I can't even think of saving a deposit for a flat, it is so unattainable for me or my friends. Young people are getting frustrated because we are so vulnerable."" In the capital, the cost of renting has risen by 4.5% in the past year to an average of £1,032 per month, according to LSL Property Services. This rise has left rents 46% higher in London than the national average, even though costs have been rising in the rest of the UK as well. The LSL survey also suggested that the level of arrears among tenants had worsened, with nearly 10% of all rents late or in arrears. Such rising costs and financial difficulties have been a factor in the increase in stay-at-home youngsters. A striking official statistic revealed that between 1997 and 2011, the number of 20- to 34-year-olds living with one or both of their parents had risen by 20%. This had happened despite population levels in this age group remaining static. One in four men and one in seven women in this age bracket lived with their parents last year - a total of three million young people. Locked out A report published on Wednesday by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation suggested that parents ought to keep setting places at the dinner table for their children for some time to come. It predicts that the number of 18- to 30-year-olds unable to afford to leave their parents' home will rise to 3.7 million by 2020. ""In 2020, young people will be further marginalised within a badly functioning housing system,"" the charity's report says. The authors suggested that rental costs would rise. This will make it increasingly difficult for youngsters - some of whom will be saddled with student debts already - to save for a deposit to buy a home. For some, that will mean an application for an interest-free loan from the ""Bank of Mum and Dad"", according to research by one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, the Halifax. Its survey suggested that a third of parents had made a financial contribution to help their children get on the property ladder. As choosy lenders ask for bigger deposits, so the amount parents are lending has risen, the survey claims. The Halifax estimated that the financial input from parents had risen by 31% in the last five years to £12,846. ""Despite concern for their own financial future, parents continue to stump up a contribution or welcome their children back to the nest to allow them to save,"" says Stephen Noakes, mortgage director at the Halifax. Tips when starting work All of this comes as youth unemployment - that is jobless 16- to 24-year-olds - stands at more than a million in the UK. Those who have found a job can take steps to ease the financial burden for themselves and their parents, according to the Money Advice Service. The service, funded by the financial services industry, suggests: This final point is already an issue for those approaching retirement now, especially the self-employed. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of people working beyond state pension age has almost doubled since 1993. ""Having more older people in the workforce will increasingly become the norm,"" says Darren Philp, policy director for the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF). ""The problem comes when people want to retire but end up stuck at work because they cannot afford to leave. With half the workforce not saving into a pension, this is going to become a painful reality for millions. ""It is vital that we get more people planning and saving for their old age, and that they start as early as possible."" Today's young people already know that they will have to work for longer. The state pension age will rise to 66 for men and women by 2020, and then to 67 by 2028. They are more likely to live for longer. But the question that many young people will be asking is whether they will be anywhere near as well off during that life, and that retirement, as their parents.","On Father's Day this Sunday, sons and daughters across the UK will be thanking their dads for all their support over the last year."
"She warned financial conditions in the US had become ""less supportive"" of growth. The US central bank released Ms Yellen's prepared comments ahead of her latest appearance before Congress. The bank raised interest rates by 0.25% for the first time in nine years in December. In her prepared testimony, Ms Yellen said: ""Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers and a further appreciation of the dollar. ""Against this backdrop, the [Federal Reserve] Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labour market indicators will continue to strengthen."" 'Intensified uncertainty' Ms Yellen added China's ""unclear"" currency policy was fuelling global stock market volatility. She said the decline in China's currency, the yuan, had ""intensified uncertainty about China's exchange rate policy and the prospects for its economy"". ""This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial markets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth."" While she said she was confident China's economy was not facing a ""hard landing"", Ms Yellen said the overall uncertainty created by the world's second-largest economy was behind some of the steep falls in global commodity prices, which in turn were creating stress for exporting nations. Ms Yellen added that ""low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies"" as well as in commodity-producing firms around the world. If such problems materialised, she added, ""foreign activity and demand for US exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further"". In response to the comments, Brian Jacobson from Wells Fargo Asset Management said: ""I think she pushed out the next rate hike. ""Until there is stability in the price of oil and the value of the dollar, I wouldn't expect much more action out of the Fed,"" he told Reuters. Deutsche Bank economists said in a note: ""In our view, her comments take a March rate hike off the table, while retaining the option to potentially raise rates later this year"". Defending Fed policy Following her prepared testimony Ms Yellen responded to questions in Congress about the new way in which the central bank implemented its last rate rise. Congress is concerned the new policy benefits the country's banks more than the American public, because banks receive a higher interest rate on the reserves they hold at the Fed. Supporters of the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) policy say it allows the central bank to maintain control of the market. Ms Yellen has called the policy a ""traditional tool"" for adjusting rates, citing its use by other central banks around the globe. The Fed was given the power to offer IOER by Congress in 2006. Stock market turmoil US stock markets opened higher after the comments. Recent stock market turmoil has prompted most Wall Street analysts to push back their forecast of when the next US Federal Reserve interest rate rise will occur, from March to June at the earliest. US stock markets have taken a battering in recent weeks over concerns caused by the economic slowdown in China, which has in turn led to lower commodity and oil prices, while the weaker yuan has made Chinese exports cheaper than those from the US. The Dow Jones is down some 8.5% since the start of the year, the S&P 500 is down more than 9% since 1 January and the Nasdaq is lower by 14%. US economic growth in the last three months of 2015 also slowed dramatically, to 0.7% compared with the same period a year earlier, falling from 2% three months earlier.",US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has poured cold water on the prospect of a second rise in interest rates any time soon.
"At least 600 ""highly skilled"" roles will be added in Manchester working on software, machine learning and AWS, its cloud computing business. The company will also create 250 and 180 jobs at its development centres in Edinburgh and Cambridge respectively. Doug Gurr, Amazon's UK country manager, described the new roles as ""Silicon Valley jobs in Britain"". Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, said the new positions were an ""enormous vote of confidence in the UK"". Amazon will have about 27,500 employees in the UK by the end of this year, with 6,500 people in its corporate, AWS and R&D divisions. That means more than 20,000 people work in its 17 ""fulfilment centres"", or warehouses, and 40 delivery stations in the UK. Earlier this month Amazon came under fire for cutting benefits for UK warehouse workers, partly offsetting recent pay rises. It has also reported more than 440 health and safety incidents at its UK warehouses since 2015, according to Freedom of Information requests submitted by the GMB union. The new Manchester office will be located across 90,000 sq ft of space in the Hanover Building in the Northern Quarter. They will work on projects including software development, machine learning and R&D and complement existing work at development centres in London, Cambridge and Edinburgh. The development centre in Cambridge has teams working on the next generation of Amazon devices including Kindle and Echo; its drone delivery service Prime Air; and improving its virtual assistant Alexa to help it better understand different accents and handle more complex questions. The new hires will bolster Amazon's development centre in in the Waverley Gate building in Edinburgh, which was the company's first R&D site outside North America. Staff are working on advertising technology and personalised shopping recommendations so that customers are shown appropriate items from the 250 million products available on the site. Last year Amazon opened a new UK head office and development centre in Shoreditch, East London. The company now has more than 100 buildings in the UK. The e-commerce giant, founded by Jeff Bezos, briefly become the second US-listed firm after Apple to have a market value of more than $1 trillion last month. Since then its shares have lost ground, leaving the company worth $872bn. Globally it employs more than 575,000 people - almost the same as Luxembourg's population. Sales totalled close to $53bn for the three months to June, with a record quarterly profit of $2.5bn.","Amazon has revealed plans to create more than 1,000 jobs in the UK in Manchester, Edinburgh and Cambridge."
"A statement from prosecutors said: ""The Swiss bank is suspected of having directly, and not via its Belgian subsidiary, approached Belgian clients to convince them to set up constructions aimed at evading taxes."" UBS said it would ""defend itself against any unfounded allegations"". It is the latest in a series of probes into malpractice by banks. The prosecutors' statement said the judicial investigation came after ""excellent"" help from French authorities, who had been looking at allegations that UBS had been encouraging clients to open accounts in Switzerland to avoid tax between the years 2004-12. The US has also been looking into whether the bank allowed its US customers to hide their wealth from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to avoid paying full tax. In 2014, Belgian police carried out raids both at the bank and at the homes of UBS Belgium chief executive Marcel Bruehwiler and a client. Mr Bruehwiler was also charged at the time. UBS denied that its Belgian division had ever supported tax evasion. UBS's small Belgian subsidiary, which employed around 60 staff including 20 private bankers, has since been sold to Belgian private bank Puilaetco Dewaay.",Swiss bank giant UBS is being investigated over money laundering and serious organised tax fraud in Belgium.
"By Richard WestcottBBC Transport Correspondent Underwater sonar equipment turned up a strange object more than two miles beneath the waves just before Christmas. Earlier this month they sent down an unmanned submarine to take a picture. Experts at the Western Australian Museum think it is a 19th-century ship made of metal. This is the second uncharted shipwreck found miles beneath the waves during the search for the missing plane. Last year, investigators released ghostly images of man-made debris scattered along the sea floor, including what is clearly an old anchor. The hunt for MH370 no longer makes headlines, but what some have described as the most complex search in history has continued for almost two years. Three ships are methodically combing the belly of the southern Indian Ocean. Before this search, scientists knew more about the surface of the moon than the bottom of this stretch of water, so it is not surprising that they keep revealing secrets. Along with the shipwrecks, a number of previously unknown underwater volcanoes have been discovered. The search teams have now checked two thirds of the 120,000 sq km search zone. Wing find That is an area not much smaller than Greece, so mountainous that it dwarfs the Alps, with weather as hostile as any on earth. Because conditions are so dangerous, the three ships involved travel at walking pace. The search will conclude later this year and after that the authorities have admitted they will give up unless some debris is found. They are confident they are looking in the right place after a piece of a wing from MH370 was washed up on an Indian Ocean island thousands of miles away. Oceanographers have modelled the way the sea would have moved the fragment, and how long it would have taken to reach Reunion island. They say it all points to the aircraft coming down where they are currently looking, although no-one has any idea why it ended up so far off course. The plane had 239 people on board and was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on 8 March 2014 when air traffic controllers lost contact with it. Last year Malaysia Airlines appointed Aer Lingus boss Christoph Mueller as chief executive in a bid to revive the ailing company. In June the airline announced plans to axe 6,000 jobs from its 20,000-strong workforce and abandon unprofitable routes to stem substantial losses.",Search teams looking for the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 think they have stumbled across a 19th-Century shipwreck.
"The firm has also been hit by charges related to the writedown of the value of its disc manufacturing business, particularly falling Blu-Ray DVD sales. The consumer electronics giant now expects to report a full-year loss of 130bn yen ($1.3bn; £770m). In February, it said it would make a net loss of 110bn yen. Sony also revised its operating income estimate to 26bn yen, a sharp drop from the 80bn yen forecast it made in February. The main reason for the revision comes from additional expenses, related to the company's restructuring plans. In a statement, Sony - which is undergoing a major restructuring programme - said it would be hit by an extra 30bn yen in additional expenses related to its exit from the PC business. It also said it would incur 25bn yen in impairment charges relating to its overseas disc manufacturing business, with the increasing popularity of downloading of music and films by consumers having hit demand for CDs and DVDs. Sony said demand for ""physical media"" had contracted ""faster than anticipated"". Sony had announced in February that it would be selling its PC business, and also said at the time that it would split its television division into a separate subsidy as part of its restructuring programme. The TV and PC units have been a big drag on Sony's earnings in recent years. Earlier this year, ratings agency Moody's cited concerns over the two divisions as a key reason behind its move to cut Sony's credit rating to junk status. Sony is due to announce its full-year results on 14 May.",Japan's Sony has said it will report a bigger-than-expected loss for the year to March due to extra costs from exiting its Vaio PC business.
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of spending a few hours in the company of a man who, though not at the moment a household name, is likely to be one of the most important figures in the way the world of computer technology develops in the next 20 years. My film of the interview is being broadcast tonight on Newsnight (though not the bit, thankfully, where he humiliates me at chess). Demis Hassabis is the founder and chief executive of Deep Mind, the artificial intelligence business bought by Google for £400m at the start of the year. He is also a chess master (so maybe my crashing loss to him was not such a humiliation), the developer behind some of the biggest games of the 1990s including Theme Park, and the Usain Bolt of the annual Mind Sports Olympiad, an event where now apparently even his children are starting to impress. His day job is now looking at how artificial intelligence (AI in shorthand) will develop our understanding of data and the way computers make sense of the world around us. Demis - it would seem odd to call him Mr Hassabis given that he wears t-shirts and looks a bit like your classic Silicon Valley entrepreneur explains AI by way of Deep Blue. You'll remember, that was the computer that famously beat chess master Garry Kasparov in 1997. But as Demis points out, Deep Blue was very good at chess because it was programmed to be. It couldn't, however, play noughts and crosses. Artificial intelligence is about changing that. It is about enabling computers to ""learn"" and understand vast swathes of data for example on climate change, health or economics beyond the capacity of the unaided human mind. And then to be able to apply what it has learnt to other fields. The development of such ""thinking computers"" is of course fraught with difficulty. One only has to think of the possible military applications to get a sense of that. And Terminator is a film we all remember well. Demis reveals to me that he is well aware of the concerns. So aware, that Google is setting up an ethics committee to look at the possible implications of artificial intelligence. In a similar way to health research, where this work goes will become of vital importance in the next 20 years. Google has already said that it will not engage in military research. Demis said that this commitment was one of the reasons he agreed to sell Deep Mind to them. Regulatory oversight by governments will also surely be necessary. This cannot simply be left to the companies themselves to police what they are doing. At some point, this will be a major public debate. For so important an issue it is all rather sotto voce at the moment. It is time governments and other interested bodies started focusing.","Chess-playing Londoner reveals his plans for computers ""that think"""
"By Phil MercerBBC News, Sydney While sunblock has shielded generations from harm, it is also being used to safeguard the health and vitality of Australian grapes as the nation reflects on another scorching year when temperature records continued to tumble. At Tyrrell's vineyard in the Hunter Valley, 165km north of Sydney, the midday sun beats down on some of Australia's oldest vines. They date back to the late 1800s, and have thrived in tough conditions. The quality of the vintage depends not only on the sun and the soil, but the temperature. Very hot weather can inflict serious damage, and too much heat can cause the berries to shrivel or suffer sunburn. ""You put sunscreen on your kids when they go out in the sun, so we put it on our grapevines. That just goes on like a normal spray,"" says Bruce Tyrrell, the chief executive of Tyrrell's Wines. ""Your vineyard gets this funny white-blue colour, and you look on the berries and there is a little coating on them. It is just like putting sunscreen on and it gives it some protection."" It's not only science that is helping to protect the crop, but also sound husbandry in a region where temperatures can exceed 45C (113F). ""It is a matter of having your vineyard laid out to handle your conditions,"" Mr Tyrrell tells the BBC. ""We plant north-south rows, so that you don't have the western sun directly on the fruit."" Heatproofing businesses Scientists have predicted that climate change will make heatwaves in Australia more frequent and severe - and when the mercury rockets, so do the economic costs. When Melbourne sweltered through a four-day hot spell in January 2014, it is estimated that firms in the city lost about 10m Australian dollars ($8m; £5m) in revenue each day. A subsequent survey found around 60% of businesses expect that more regular heatwaves over the next 20 years would hit their profits. Prof Christopher Wright from the University of Sydney Business School explains that many industries would have to heatproof their operations, including agriculture, retail and insurance companies. ""They are thinking about how can we insure for extreme events like bushfires that are precipitated by heatwaves, so they have to model for an increasingly unpredictable climate. ""Large shopping centres are looking at dramatic increases in electricity costs as they try to increase air conditioning,"" he says. ""Heatwaves are becoming longer, and they are becoming more severe, and that becomes hard to manage depending in which business sector you are in. ""So my own take is that a lot of businesses are probably fairly unprepared for what is coming,"" he adds. Health warning Heatwaves cause more deaths each year in Australia than any other natural disaster, and they pose particular risks to the bedrock of the economy: the workforce. In November, the Electrical Trades Union (ETU) issued a health warning to staff working outdoors across the state of New South Wales as extreme heat took hold. When temperatures exceed 38C (100F), work is automatically halted because of the risk of heat rashes, cramps and exhaustion. ""Our union has produced a detailed policy for working in heat,"" says ETU secretary Steve Butler. ""Extreme heat can cause a range of health problems, from the uncomfortable to the potentially deadly."" Two years ago, Sydney experienced its hottest day on record when temperatures passed 45C. It was a punishing time for those not able to seek air-conditioned relief, as a crushing heat smothered the nation's biggest city. Many shoppers stayed at home, but it was workers who had to bear the brunt of the conditions. ""It made people feel lethargic,"" says Russell Zimmerman, the head of the Australian Retailers Association. ""There were trials getting people to and from work. Obviously you'll have people who go by public transport. Invariably on a really hot day you get some kind of problem with public transport, be it rails buckling or vehicles breaking down."" Shaped by climate Yet, this is a land of extremes. And while there is disagreement about man's influence on the climate, there is a shared belief that Australia has thrived in the face of unrelenting environmental challenges, from drought to floods, to bushfires and a burning sun. A nation's prosperity could now depend on how it adapts to a warmer future. ""The tyranny of extreme climate has shaped us,"" says Tim Harcourt from the University of New South Wales Business School. ""If Australia had a beautiful, temperate climate all-round, we'd be a very different people. ""We have faced great climate challenges through our history, and that is partly the way we shape our character and we shape our approach to the economy.""","Slip, slop, slap.

"The prime minister also said that her Brexit plan would secure millions of aviation jobs in Britain. It comes amid growing criticism of her plan from MPs, with another government member resigning in protest on Sunday. The proposal urges close links with the EU on trade in goods, but not services. In a speech at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday, she offered more than £300m of government and industry money for several projects, including research on more environmentally-friendly aircraft. There will be additional money for two new spaceports - one in Cornwall, one in Scotland - and a long-awaited commitment to build a new high-tech fighter aircraft that will eventually replace the Eurofighter Typhoon. The UK aviation sector generates turnover of about £60bn and supports almost a million jobs. British aerospace exports alone were worth £30bn in 2017. However, industry trade association ADS has warned the sector could be paralysed if Britain leaves the EU customs union and single market, given its dependence on cross-border trade in components. In June, Airbus UK boss Tom Enders said it could pull production out of the UK if it quit the bloc without a transition deal. The French firm employs about 14,000 people in Britain. However, last week, Mr Enders tentatively welcomed Mrs May's plan, saying the government is now moving in the right direction. But in an interview with the BBC, the boss of Airbus's arch-rival, Boeing, pledged to keep investing in Britain. Dennis Muilenberg said while the company did not welcome disruption to the movement of goods - or to the Europe-wide systems of aviation regulation - his company's plans would not be changed by the UK's plans to leave the EU. ""We are going to continue to grow in the UK,"" he said, adding that Boeing would maintain a long-term view of its UK investments, ""regardless of how Brexit plays out"". However, he added there were worries over whether ""we continue to see free flow of goods and services"". In her speech, Mrs May argued that her proposals - including frictionless free trade in goods and the avoidance of a hard border in Northern Ireland - would protect the supply chains that big aerospace firms depend on. She also said the UK could remain part of EU agencies critical for the aerospace industry, such as the European Aviation Safety Agency. 'Encourage investment' ""By working closely together, government and industry have ensured we remain at the forefront of civil aviation and that our air power is second to none,"" she said. ""Today I want us to build on that, and ensure not only that we retain our prominence, but that in an increasingly competitive industry we make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead."" ADS has welcomed the government's plan, but insists there are important and complex issues still to be resolved. However, chief executive Paul Everitt said the prime minister's remarks were a ""strong statement of intent"" that would help build confidence and encourage investment. ""The international political, military and business leaders visiting Farnborough will be reassured by last week's Brexit White Paper and are keen to hear more about the UK's post-Brexit ambitions.""","Theresa May has promised extra investment for the aerospace industry, just weeks after Airbus threatened to reduce its UK presence because of Brexit disruption."
"The firm said the design, seen as a racist reference to coronavirus, was not one of its products and the employee had been dismissed. The design, which depicted a takeaway box of ""bat fried rice"", had prompted calls for a boycott of the brand. Bogus claims the virus was spread by people eating bats have swept the web. Lululemon said the design was ""inappropriate and inexcusable"". 'Insults China' The row began on Sunday, when one of the Canadian firm's art directors, Trevor Fleming, posted a picture of the design on Instagram, which is unavailable in China. However, the image, created by a California-based artist, found its way to Chinese social media platform Weibo, where it spawned the hashtag ""Lululemon insults China"" and garnered hundreds of millions of views. People also expressed anger on Twitter using the hashtag #BoycottLululemon. ""We acted immediately and the person involved is no longer an employee of Lululemon,"" the firm said on Instagram, without naming the employee responsible for the design. In a statement to Reuters news agency, Mr Fleming said: ""It is something I deeply regret, and my eyes have been opened to the profound ripple effect that this mistake has had."" Coronavirus was first identified last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan. It is thought to have originated in bats, with other wild animals, possibly pangolins, playing a role in transmission to humans. Lululemon has caused controversy in the past. In 2004, founder Chip Wilson - who no longer leads the firm - mocked the Japanese pronunciation of the company's name. And in 2013 he said some women's bodies were unsuitable for the brand's clothing, leading to accusations of ""fat shaming"".",Sportswear maker Lululemon has apologised after one of its employees posted a T-shirt design on social media that caused outrage in China.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The bank, which had a significant marketing push after launch, only started offering current accounts in the UK after the EU referendum. However, it said that the ""timing and framework"" of the Withdrawal Agreement made it impossible to continue. With about 200,000 customers, it was one of the smaller operators in the UK. Thomas Grosse, chief banking officer at N26, which has a European banking licence, said: ""While we respect the political decision that has been taken, it means that N26 will be unable to serve our customers in the UK and will have to leave the market."" What must customers do? Accounts will operate as normal until 15 April, by which time funds should be transferred. Will Sorby, general manager for N26 in the UK, said that accounts would be closed automatically on that date after money has been removed. Anyone who has money in an account and fails to move it in time will see the cash shifted into a holding account. Following the closure of the company's UK operations, the majority of its UK staff would move into new roles within the business, the bank said. It is bigger in Germany, where it has its Berlin headquarters, and has recently launched in the US. The move comes on the day that shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said he fears there's a ""risk"" of an exodus from the City if the government does not get a swift deal with the EU on financial services. However, there are no signs as yet of any other challenger or bigger banks following N26 in quitting the UK. Monzo and Starling have a UK banking licence, unlike N26. It remains tough for challenger banks in the UK current account sector, primarily because a large number of customers do not use their products as their main transactional account.","Challenger bank N26 is closing accounts for UK customers on 15 April, blaming difficulties created by the Brexit process."
"On an annual basis gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 3.1%. The figures show the economy is now worth 0.2% more than it was at its peak in 2008, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The service sector is the only part of the economy that has passed its previous 2008 peak, although that accounts for almost 80% of UK output. Other key sectors, including construction, industrial production and manufacturing, have yet to outstrip levels reached in 2008. The UK economy is forecast to be the fastest growing among the G7 developed nations, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). On Thursday, the IMF predicted the UK would expand by 3.2% this year, up from a previous forecast of 2.8%. Productivity Chancellor George Osborne said: ""Thanks to the hard work of the British people, today we reach a major milestone in our long-term economic plan."" But shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, said people were not feeling happier: ""With GDP per head not set to recover for three more years and [with] most people still seeing their living standards squeezed this is no time for complacent claims that the economy is fixed."" Analysis: Anthony Reuben, BBC head of statistics Let's take a pinch of salt with these figures. First of all, this is the preliminary estimate, so it's an educated guess based on about 40% of the economic activity that will go into later estimates. But also, in two months the ONS will revise these figures for a once-in-15-years change to the methodology. It will change the treatment in the GDP figures of things like spending on research and development by companies and the government buying weapons. So the trend is almost certainly right - we can say that there was considerable growth in the economy in the second quarter - but 0.8% is unlikely to be the eventual figure. And it may turn out that we have not yet reached the 2008 peak, or indeed that we did so a while ago. 'Marred' Output per head is not expected to reach its pre-crisis level until 2017, partly because productivity from those in work remains weak, along with the fact the population as a whole has grown. The news was given a muted welcome by Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist: ""Any celebrations will of course also be marred by the fact that the milestone reminds us that it has taken some six years for the country to merely regain the economic might it had before the financial crisis struck."" Other countries recovered the output lost to the crisis much earlier than the UK. Germany regained its peak in 2010, with the US and France following a year later. Set against that are changes due to be made to the way the ONS calculates its figures, which will be brought in in September. These may show the economy was actually stronger in 2008 than had been thought, and therefore the ground was made up sooner.",The UK economy has returned to pre-crisis levels by expanding 0.8% in the second quarter of this year.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The weakening of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote led to the change in the threshold. The amount of compensation payable is set at €100,000 across the European Union, so significant currency moves can alter the level for UK savers. The change means the protection returns to its pre-July 2015 level. Criticism It covers money in current accounts, savings accounts, and cash ISAs. Under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), up to £85,000 per person, per institution is now protected if a bank, building society or credit union goes bust. In other words, if the bank collapses, savers will get any money in these accounts up to £85,000 paid back in compensation. Joint accounts have a protection level of £170,000. Mark Neale, chief executive of the FSCS, said: ""The limit increase will protect even more of peoples' savings. The new limit will protect about 98% of people so it is worth people knowing their limits."" The scheme has a protection checker for savers. Some MPs have been critical of the way the limit has fluctuated and have called for a settled level to maintain public awareness. At the start of the banking crisis in 2007 the maximum payout for depositors was just £31,700 per person, made up of 100% of the first £2,000 and then 90% of their next £33,000.","Savings of up to £85,000 will be safe if a bank or building society collapses from now - following a £10,000 rise in the protection level."

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) is seeking a public declaration of misconduct, financial penalties and corrective advertising. Volkswagen Australia said it is reviewing the ACCC claims. In a statement, the firm said it does not think that the court action ""provides any practical benefit to consumers because software solutions for cars affected by the voluntary recall are expected soon"".

"The listing would be the first by a UK carmaker for years, following the sale of brands such as Jaguar, Bentley and Rolls-Royce to foreign owners. Analysts say the firm, which also on Wednesday posted half-year profits of £42m, would be worth up to £5bn. Its main shareholders are an Italian investment fund and Kuwaiti investors. The 105-year-old carmaker said in its announcement that it would initially float a minimum of 25% of the company. Chief executive Andy Palmer told the BBC that some shareholders would ""cash out"" their investment. He described the plans as a ""key milestone"" in the history of the company, and said a luxury brand like Aston Martin was ""impervious"" to any trading uncertainties caused by Brexit. Despite an illustrious history and a brand name synonymous with 007 films, Aston Martin has struggled for decades to make a profit. But under Mr Palmer, a former Nissan executive, the company has been broadening its product range and has moved into new areas. The company is involved in projects to build an electric flying car, luxury homes in the US, and even a personal submarine. ""We are a luxury company and not just a car company,"" Mr Palmer told Radio 4's Today programme. It expects full-year sales for 2018 to rise to between 6,200 and 6,400 units, and in the medium-term it aims to build nearly 10,000 in the 2020 calendar year. Part of the turnaround strategy strategy involved targeting female buyers - no easy task given the company has sold fewer than 4,000 cars to women in its 105-year history. Aston Martin must be less dependent on a narrow portfolio and one type of customer, Mr Palmer says. He said he was unconcerned that the stock market listing would come ahead of Brexit and possible trading uncertainties. ""The benefit of being a luxury company is we are relatively impervious to those kind of changes,"" he told the BBC. Aston Martin exports 25% of its car to the European Union. ""We'd probably benefit from a weaker pound,"" he said. However, he said the carmaker was increasing its stockpile of engines, made in Germany, from three to five days ""just to live a little bit of insulation"" against Brexit disruption. Alongside the flotation announcement, Aston Martin also disclosed its first-half results, reporting an 8% year-on-year sales increase to £445m for the six months ended 30 June. It said the performance was driven by its consulting business as well as increased revenue from sales of its special edition vehicles, including the Vanquish Zagato family and DB4 GT Continuation models. Mr Palmer said: ""Today's results show that we have continued to deliver sustainable growth, margins and value for our shareholders whilst launching three new models and variants in the first half of the year."" As part of the restructuring, Aston Martin it to open a new factory at St Athan, in Wales, in 2019. Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Laith Khalaf said Aston Martin's stock market value could put it near the top of the FTSE 250 share index. He said the success of Ferrari's floatation in New York in 2015 boded well for the UK company's plans and underlined investors' appetite for such luxury brands.

The overwhelming majority run on petrol or diesel. But the world is changing. Manufacturers are investing heavily in developing both hybrid and pure electric models to help meet tightening emissions standards. Towns and cities want to impose restrictions on conventional cars to reduce pollution; and in the long term, some countries, including the UK and France, want to ban them altogether. Although mass electrification will take time, experts agree the number of electric cars is almost certainly going to increase dramatically over the next few years. But will we be able to generate all the electricity that millions of battery-powered vehicles will require? Here in the UK, National Grid has modelled a number of different scenarios, in an attempt to predict just how much extra power will be needed. ""By 2030 we could see as many as nine million electric vehicles on the road,"" says the company's energy insights manager, Marcus Stewart. ""That would add around 5% to the annual energy demand on the electricity system. So it's going to add demand, but maybe not as much as you might think."" One reason the anticipated demand isn't higher is because National Grid assumes that so-called ""smart charging"" will be widespread. The principle is relatively straightforward. If millions of people charge their cars at the same time - for example when they come home from work - it will put heavy strain on the grid. But that doesn't have to happen. Smart chargers will allow vehicles to draw power only when it is readily available, avoiding peak periods, while ensuring that they are fully charged when their owners need them. ""By spreading the load overnight you can immensely vary the capacity needed,"" explains David Martell, chief executive of Chargemaster, which builds and operates charging systems. ""Going forward, electricity companies will offer different tariffs at different times of day, so that actually, financially it's worth your while doing that kind of thing."" Smart charging, then, could be a useful tool for managing demand when vehicles are parked for hours at a time, either at home or at the workplace. But the carmaker Nissan is hoping to go a step further. At the Nissan Technology Centre in Cranfield, Bedfordshire, a number of the company's electric Leaf models are lined up alongside a bank of chargers. But these cars aren't just drawing energy from the grid; they're also putting it back. The system is called Vehicle to Grid, or V2G. The Japanese company is developing it in partnership with the Italian power firm Enel and is already operating a small trial hub in Denmark. Electric cars are, in effect, energy storage devices, and because they spend much of their time parked up not doing anything they can help smooth out the peaks and troughs in energy demand. ""Basically, we can consider the car as a battery with wheels,"" says Maria Laura Corallini, the engineer in charge of the V2G project. ""You can use the energy storage capability in the battery to provide specific services back to the grid."" The system uses software to regulate the charging level of multiple vehicles. When the grid needs extra power, it can draw very small amounts from each individual vehicle. When energy is abundant, it can top them up again. Users will get paid for the electricity they provide. If thousands of cars are connected together, then the amount of energy given back to the grid can be substantial, and it can be varied on a second-by-second basis. Ms Corallini calls it ""a virtual power station"". It is a complicated system, and Nissan has been testing it on a small scale at Cranfield for more than a year. Initially the plan is to sell it to businesses that operate large fleets, although the company says it will also introduce a residential version. Other organisations are also experimenting with the technology. Not everyone agrees that V2G makes commercial sense, however. The chief technical officer of Tesla, JB Straubel, for example, has suggested in the past that he doesn't see it becoming a viable solution, largely due to its cost and complexity. Some experts have suggested it could accelerate battery degradation, although Ms Corallini insists the reverse is true, because the car is maintained in an optimum state of charge. A recent study by researchers at Warwick University came to a similar conclusion, suggesting V2G technology could increase battery life by up to 10%. More Technology of Business According to National Grid's Marcus Stewart, both V2G and intelligent charging could encourage the expansion of renewable energy, as well as helping to balance power supply and demand. ""Renewables, particularly solar and wind, don't always generate at the time they are needed the most,"" he says. ""A battery enables them to be used more effectively and less energy to be wasted, so electric vehicles and renewables work well from that perspective."" Ultimately, if National Grid's forecasts are correct, replacing our petrol and diesel cars with electric versions will add about five gigawatts to peak demand. It is still a fair amount of energy - more than the output of a modern nuclear power station - but with technologies like smart charging in place, National Grid believes the extra demand can be met from a combination of sources, including renewables and gas generation. There may be other obstacles to the mass take-up of electric cars - the availability of batteries for example, and the need to invest in charging infrastructure. But if we manage demand properly, there's no reason why running our cars on electricity should stop us lighting our homes or boiling our kettles.","If electric cars really are the future, where is all the electricity to power them going to come from?"
"It makes him the highest-paid chief executive in the US. Mr Pichai became chief executive of the search engine giant following the creation of its parent, Alphabet. The founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have amassed fortunes of $34.6bn and $33.9bn, according to Forbes. Mr Pichai, 43, was awarded 273,328 Alphabet shares on 3 February, worth a total of $199m, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The new award of shares takes Mr Pichai's total stock value to approximately $650m. Mr Pichai's share award will vest incrementally each quarter until 2019. In other words, full control over the shares will pass to him on a gradual basis. The Google chief executive joined the company since 2004, initially leading product management on a number of Google's client software products, including Google Chrome] and Chrome OS, as well as being largely responsible for Google Drive. He also oversaw the development of Gmail and Google Maps. He previously worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company. It comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of Google's tax affairs, following the company's deal with HM Revenue & Customs to pay back taxes dating from 2005. The controversial tax deal was labelled derisory by Labour. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for greater transparency, saying it looked like a ""sweetheart deal"". ""HMRC seems to have settled for a relatively small amount in comparison with the overall profits that are made by the company in this country. And some of the independent analysts have argued that it should be at least 10 times this amount,"" he said. Google's regulatory filings for for the period 2005 to 2014, show it generated sales of £24bn ($34.6bn) in the UK during the period with an estimated profit of about £7.2bn on those sales. Page 83 of its most recent 10k report states ""revenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers"". Last week, Alphabet - Google's parent company - surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable firm after it reported a profit of $4.9bn (£3.4bn) in the three months to the end of December, an increase from $4.7bn a year ago. On an annual basis, Alphabet made $16.3bn, but the figures showed that the ""Other Bets"" business lost $3.6bn during the period, while Google's operating income rose to $23.4bn, as online advertising increased.

""Reliability is so important to motorists, especially when times are tough."" 'Increasingly complex' Owners of used Hondas have a 10% chance of their cars suffering a breakdown, according to the survey of 50,000 Warranty Direct policies. ""Japanese carmakers really do deliver on reliability and Honda is exceptionally good at this,"" said Mr Hallett, pointing out that this was the seventh year in a row when Honda topped the ranking. US carmaker Chevrolet was the only non-Asian marque to rank as one of the 10 most reliable used cars. Some 22% of Chevrolets break down at least once each year. By comparison, the worst performing Japanese brand was Nissan, with a failure rate of 25%, just ahead of South Korea's Kia at 26%. By contrast, seven in 10 Land Rover owners will experience a breakdown in any given year, the survey said. Failure rates for other luxury marques was better at between 41% and 45%, while most mainstream European brands had failure rates of between 31% and 55%.

"It will also say the ill-fated takeover of the Britannia Building Society sowed the seeds of the problems at the bank. The BBC's business editor, Kamal Ahmed, has been told Sir Christopher Kelly's draft report will say the organisation was ""culpable"" and checks made before it bought the Britannia were ""cursory"". Its findings will be challenged by former members of the Co-op board. The members, who also worked for the Britannia, will write to Sir Christopher this week to claim the report is not factually accurate. 'Scathing' The report into the bank was commissioned by the Co-op Group and is due to be published next week. It is the latest stage in the battle to uncover the truth about how one of the UK's oldest banks failed after the discovery of a £1.5bn black-hole in its balance sheet. Our business editor said the draft report was ""scathing"". It says the ill-fated takeover of the Britannia Building Society in 2009 was the at the heart of its downfall. Our business editor said a draft of the report says that the Co-op Bank board did not have ""their eye on the ball"" during the takeover of the Britannia. It says that ""due diligence"" - the work done before a takeover is agreed - was ""extremely cursory"". 'Disastrous' The report also says that there were major problems with the Co-op Group's takeover of the Somerfield supermarket chain. Those who will challenge the report's findings include Neville Richardson, the former chief executive of the Britannia, who has said that IT failures and the attempt of the Co-op Bank to take over 630 Lloyds Bank branches added to the problems at the bank. Both the Co-operative Group and the bank announced major losses in the past few weeks. The group's losses were £2.5bn for 2013 - the worst results in the group's 150-year history, with £2.1bn of that coming from the Co-op Bank. The bank's figure contained a trading loss of £1.44bn for the year to December, when the group lost control of Co-op Bank to US hedge funds. Chief executive Richard Pennycook said 2013 had been a ""disastrous"" year. He said the results ""should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who doubts just how serious the challenges we face are"". He said in those five years the group had become bloated in terms of its costs and strategy, and was now in need of wholesale reform if ""inexorable decline"" was to be avoided. The group is trying to cut costs, and has already announced £100m of cost cuts this year. Deeper cuts are expected to be made, possibly including job losses.",A major report into the near collapse of the Co-operative Bank will blame poor governance at the organisation.
"The six main auditing firms will have their senior appointments vetted by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) as it steps up efforts to monitor their work. The FRC said it wanted to restore public confidence in auditors. Their effectiveness has been called into question after a string of accounting failures at major firms. In particular, the collapse of construction giant Carillion, which went into liquidation in January, has focused attention on the work of one big auditor, KPMG, which approved the firm's accounts 10 months earlier. The FRC made its announcement as part of what it called a ""significant stepping up"" in its supervision and monitoring of audit firms. Transparency PwC, KPMG, EY, Deloitte, Grant Thornton and BDO, which between them audit nearly all big company accounts in the UK, will now be subject to intervention by the FRC in the process of filling ""key leadership and governance roles"".

""At that stage, if not sooner, we would want to be involved,"" the spokesperson added. Melanie McLaren, executive director of audit and actuarial regulation at the FRC, said: ""The work of the Big Six audit firms is core to the integrity and transparency of UK capital markets and so it is vital that the FRC introduces a new approach."" She said the FRC wanted to be sure that top candidates met its expectations ""in terms of experience, skills and attributes"".

"The supermarket giant says it will remove 350 tonnes of plastic a year from the environment. Britain's biggest supermarket is working with the likes of Heinz and Green Giant to replace plastic-wrapped multipacks with multi-buy deals. Tesco said the move was the first of its kind by a major UK retailer. And environmental group Greenpeace welcomed the decision to get rid of what it called ""pointless plastic"". The changes start on 2 March when Tesco will stop ordering more plastic-wrapped multipacks. Some items will remain on the shelves as Tesco sells remaining stocks. More than 40% of Tesco customers buy tinned multipacks, with 183,000 sold across its stores every day. Multipacks of baked beans, tuna, tinned tomatoes and soup are among the most frequently-bought grocery items in the UK, it said. ""We are removing all unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic from Tesco,"" said Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. Late last year Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose pledged to clear hard-to-recycle ""black plastics"" from shelves. ""While we know we have more to do, this initiative is good news for the environment,"" said Georgiana de Noronha, president of Kraft Heinz in Northern Europe. Supermarkets have come under fire from environmental campaigners for the increasing use of single-use plastic, which rose 2% in 2018 to 903,000 tonnes, according to Greenpeace. ""It's great that Tesco are getting rid of multipack plastic packaging that's completely pointless and are also pressuring their branded suppliers like Heinz and Branston to do the same,"" said Fiona Nicholls, ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK. She added: ""This is such an easy, common sense first step that all supermarkets should have done this long ago. We urge retailers to end the nonsense of double-plastic packaging on all products straight away, and be bolder by introducing reusable and refillable packaging."" The World Wide Fund for Nature also supported Tesco's move. ""We need to remove unnecessary single-use plastic wherever possible, to stop the contamination of the natural world,"" said Paula Chin, from the WWF. The top eight UK supermarkets produced 58.3 billion pieces of plastic packaging last year, according to a report last year by Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency. Tesco is not the only supermarket to look into scrapping plastic wrap around tinned goods. Waitrose has been trialling the removal of plastic wrap on multipacks of some of its canned vegetables since last October, in a move it says will save 18 tonnes of plastic a year. Aldi is running a trial in 270 stores to replace the plastic wrapping on tuna multipack tins with a cardboard alternative. Sainsbury's says it has committed to halving the use of its plastic packaging by 2025.",Tesco is removing plastic wrapping from its multipack tins in an effort to cut down on waste.
"By Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News The Grocery Code Adjudicator, Christine Tacon, said the supermarket seriously breached the industry's code of conduct to protect grocery suppliers. She found extensive evidence that Tesco had acted unreasonably when delaying payments to suppliers. Tesco apologised for the practices, saying they had harmed its suppliers. Tesco remains under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into alleged accounting irregularities. The grocery ombudsman's investigation began in February 2015 following the revelation of an accounting scandal at Tesco. In September 2014 a £250m black hole was found in the company's accounts - a sum later revised up to £326m - because of the way Tesco booked income from its suppliers. Ms Tacon said: ""I received internal Tesco emails which encouraged Tesco staff to seek agreement from suppliers to the deferral of payments due to them in order to temporarily help Tesco margins. ""I also saw internal Tesco emails suggesting that payments should not be made to suppliers before a certain date in order to avoid underperformance against a forecasted margin."" The SFO investigation began in October 2014. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said stockbrokers believed Tesco would be hit with a substantial fine from the SFO. ""Cantor Fitzgerald are suggesting Tesco could face financial penalties in excess of £500m for its accounting misdemeanours, pending the publication of the forthcoming Serious Fraud Office investigation,"" he said. ""The company is not out of the woods yet, but has at least started on the slow path of recovery."" 'Damaging consequences' Chief executive Dave Lewis said Tesco had changed substantially: ""Over the last year we have worked hard to make Tesco a very different company from the one described in the GCA report. ""The absolute focus on operating margin had damaging consequences for the business and our relationship with suppliers. This has now been fundamentally changed."" Mr Lewis said that material changes were made in January 2015 that addressed the majority of the historic practices referred to in the report: ""We have changed the way we work by reorganising, refocusing and retraining our teams and we will continue to work in a way which is consistent with the recommendations."" Shares in Tesco closed 2.3% higher at 159.3p in London. The stock has fallen almost 32% over the past 12 months. Ms Tacon's investigation found that even when a debt had been acknowledged by Tesco, on occasions the money was not paid for more than 12 months, with some amounts taking two years to be repaid, the investigation found. One example involved a supplier owed a multi-million pound sum as a result of price changes being incorrectly applied to Tesco systems over a long period. This was eventually paid back by Tesco more than two years after the incorrect charging had begun. ""I found that delay in payments was a widespread issue that affected a broad range of Tesco suppliers on a significant scale,"" Ms Tacon said. ""The delay in payments had a financial impact on suppliers, was an administrative burden to resolve, detracted from the time available to develop customer focussed business and had a detrimental impact on some suppliers' relationships with Tesco."" This is the first investigation by Ms Tacon since the creation of her role as Grocery Code Adjudicator. No fines Her investigation covers the period from June 2013 until February last year. Tesco provided her team with the findings of its own review, specifically aimed at finding practices which might be in breach of the code. Ms Tacon cannot fine Tesco as she only acquired this power after the investigation began. The adjudicator examined three key areas: the length of time taken to pay money due to suppliers, unilateral deductions from suppliers and an intentional delay in paying suppliers in some cases. On the issue of payment for better shelf positions or space for products, Ms Tacon found no evidence that Tesco breached this part of the grocery code. However, she found evidence of a range of practices that she would like examined. Her five recommendations include stopping Tesco from making unilateral deductions from money owed for goods supplied. Suppliers will be given 30 days to challenge any proposed deduction and if challenged Tesco will not be permitted to make the deduction. Ms Tacon has set a four-week deadline for Tesco to say how it plans to implement her recommendations. She will then require regular reports from the company on its progress. Business minister Anna Soubry said the adjudicator had conducted a thorough and fearless investigation into a ""scandalous situation"". ""Tesco say they have changed their practices and I very much hope they have. Paying smaller suppliers on time and treating them fairly is good and proper business. Late payment can hinder the growth and productivity of these suppliers and can threaten their existence,"" she said. The sharp fall in Tesco's share price that resulted from the accounting scandal has prompted legal action by a number of institutions and other investors in the retailer. Stewarts Law said on Tuesday it will be contacting Tesco ahead of starting formal legal action for the group, which had suffered losses running into the tens of millions of pounds following the revelation of the accounting scandal.","Tesco ""knowingly delayed paying money to suppliers in order to improve its own financial position"", the supermarket ombudsman has found."
"The economy grew by 5% over the year, after having grown at an annual pace of 4.8% in the January-to-March quarter. India was recording annual growth of 9% until two years ago, but in recent months it has seen a sharp decline blamed on a slowdown in its manufacturing and services sectors. Foreign investors have also kept away due to delays in key reforms. According to the latest figures released by the ministry of statistics, India's manufacturing sector grew at an annual pace of 2.6% during the latest quarter while farm output rose by just 1.4%. The figures are in line with official estimates. In February, India lowered its growth forecast to 5% for the year, underlining the challenges it faced in reviving the sluggish economy. Last month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the current downturn was ""temporary"" and he was confident the country's economy would bounce back to an ""8% growth rate"". However, the mood has remained pessimistic in the business community with industry leaders worried over high rates of inflation. The slowing economy has also meant that Indian companies are putting less profit back into their businesses. Annual capital investment growth slowed to 3.5% in the first three months of 2013, down from 4.5% year-on-year in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, complex business regulations are often blamed for driving foreign companies away.

"Jeffrey Skilling presided over Enron when it became embroiled in one of the biggest corporate frauds in US history. Mr Skilling's 24-year sentence could come down to 14, now that he has agreed to stop appealing against his conviction. Thousands of workers lost their jobs and retirement savings when Enron collapsed in 2001. The agreement between Mr Skilling and federal prosecutors would also allow more than $40m seized from him to be distributed to the victims of the Enron fraud. ""The proposed agreement brings certainty and finality to a long painful process,"" Mr Skilling's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said in a statement. ""Although the recommended sentence for Jeff would still be more than double any other Enron defendant, all of whom have long been out of prison, Jeff will at least have the chance to get back a meaningful part of his life,"" he added. The agreement is subject to court approval and recommends that Mr Skilling be re-sentenced to between 14 and 17-and-a-half years, including time already served. He has been in prison since December 2006. Corporate collapse Mr Skilling worked for Enron for 20 years and was chief executive for just six months, leaving the company four months before bankruptcy. A jury in Houston, Texas convicted him in May 2006 on 19 counts of securities fraud, conspiracy, insider trading and lying to auditors. The jury also found Mr Skilling's predecessor as chief executive, Kenneth Lay, guilty of fraud and conspiracy. Mr Lay died in July 2006.

"Uncertainty over Brexit has weakened the pound, which has been great for exporters but has made imported goods and raw materials more expensive. The BBC has been speaking to businesses from across the UK, finding out how their bosses are feeling and what they would like to see from the Autumn Statement on Wednesday, 23 November. Optimism in Scunthorpe In Scunthorpe Shay Eddy, the managing director of SC4 Steel which supplies the construction industry, is feeling optimistic. ""We're certainly in a better position than we were 12 months ago. ""We invested at the bottom of the cycle, we ordered a new machine that's just been commissioned now. We've just committed to another machine and we're looking at expanding and exporting starting January next year."" But like other businesses, he wants to know more about the UK's future relationship with Europe. ""More clarity would be ideal because uncertainty is no good for anybody, but we can't expect the government to tip their hand as to what they are going to be negotiating with,"" he says. Exporter angst in Banbury Norbar Torque Tools, based in Banbury, is one of Oxfordshire's best known exporters. As 35% of its sales go to mainland Europe the firm is closely watching the Brexit debate. ""The single most important thing for exporting companies like us is that the government negotiates access to the single market on favourable terms,"" says commercial director Catherine Rohl. She is also worried about the supply of skilled workers. ""It is a concern, particularly here in Banbury where unemployment is very low. And if it is going to be more difficult to recruit from across the EU in future, then that becomes even more difficult."" She says the chancellor can help with that with more support for training, education and apprenticeships in science and engineering subjects. Worcester - 'more support for R&D' Nick Grey is the founder and chief executive of Gtech, a Worcester-based firm that makes cordless vacuum cleaners and garden tools. He would like the chancellor to support research and development by extending tax breaks for investment in R&D. ""It's a good incentive, it's reasonably generous. Don't take it away definitely, and a bit more would be welcome,"" he says. South Wales - 'invest in infrastructure' In South Wales construction giant Costain is working on a £200m road project that involves building 16 structures, 12km (7.5 miles) of retaining walls and moving 2.5 million tonnes of soil and rocks. Bruce Richards, who is managing the project, says that 70% of the contracts involved have been awarded to firms in South Wales, creating 180 jobs in the process. ""We believe the government understands the importance of investment in infrastructure. We hope in the Autumn Statement that way of thinking will continue,"" he says. Northern Ireland - hopes for 'dramatic stimulus' Northern Ireland was one of the regions hardest hit by the financial crisis, with around a third of all jobs in the construction industry lost after 2008. ""The construction sector in Northern Ireland was very dramatically hit by the recession. I'm pleased to say now that we're starting to see a more fragile recovery,"" says Ray Hutchinson, managing director of Gilbert Ash, a construction firm that is building a new Marriott Hotel in Belfast. However, his company is focusing on the south-east of England where growth is stronger. Mr Ash says that ""a number"" of projects have been paused as clients weigh up the implications of Brexit. ""We will be looking to the chancellor to increase spending on infrastructure,"" he says. ""Certainly that could have a very dramatic economic stimulus on the entire economy in the UK.""","These are uneasy times for British businesses. While recent data has shown a robust economy, a slowdown in growth is being forecast for next year."
"The firm said it was consulting on cutting up to 4,556 jobs. Chief executive Jason Holt said the company had to reduce the size of its workforce to survive. Swissport operates at airports across the UK, including Heathrow and Gatwick, which are among those badly hit by the crisis. Air travel collapsed around the world after governments imposed travel restrictions during coronavirus lockdowns. While some airlines are making plans to start flying some routes again as lockdowns lift, Swissport has said its revenue is forecast to be almost 50% lower than last year due to the crisis. Mr Holt said in a message to staff: ""We must do this to secure the lifeline of funding from lenders and investors to protect as many jobs as possible in the UK and Ireland. ""It's true that we've seen tough times before - volcanic cloud, 9/11, the financial crisis - and we've weathered these. But this time it's different. We have never seen anything like Covid-19 in our lifetimes. ""We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world. ""There is no escaping the fact that the industry is now smaller than it was, and it will remain so for some time to come."" 'Devastating news' Swissport employs about 8,500 workers at airports, including baggage handlers and check-in staff. The GMB union said the announcement was ""devastating news"", with jobs set to be lost that were essential for regional economies. Nadine Houghton, national officer of the GMB, said: ""With Swissport now considering job cuts on this scale, we have deep concerns about the viability of many of our regional airports and the benefits for regional connectivity that they bring."" Oliver Richardson, national officer of Unite, said: ""We can't wait any longer, the UK government needs to urgently intervene with a bespoke financial package and an extension of the 80% furlough scheme for the aviation industry."" The Unite union in Ireland confirmed that 287 workers at Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport face redundancy. ""This will be devastating news for these workers and their families. It is also entirely unnecessary - the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme remains in place - these workers could continue to be furloughed. There is no need for any job-losses at this time. This is a disgraceful move solely rooted in the need to secure corporate profits,"" said George Brash, Unite Regional Officer for Swissport workers in Belfast. ""It is now absolutely imperative that we see urgent action in both Stormont and Westminster to safeguard our aviation sector, its workforce and the future of regional airports."" Staff at Swissport handle luggage after it's checked-in. They also de-ice and refuel planes and manage freight. The company provides essential services for most UK airports and airlines. Back in April Swissport UK warned it would have to slash thousands of jobs if more government support for the aviation sector was not forthcoming. This latest announcement demonstrates how the deep the damage to the aviation sector is. The pandemic has hit aviation hard and airlines and airports have already announced plans to scrap tens of thousands of jobs. The Department for Transport has consistently said that while the aviation sector is important to the UK economy, all firms, including aviation companies, should first explore existing government schemes and try to raise capital from investors before the government will consider the situation of individual firms. Industry association Airlines UK responded to Swissport's announcement by repeating its call for targeted government assistance for the sector. ""The need for a stimulus package of measures for the industry is now even more vital,"" said chief executive Tim Alderslade. Next Monday, the government is expected to make an announcement on international travel corridors, which would allow people from the UK to visit selected countries without having to face a 14-day quarantine on their return. Mr Alderslade welcomed that prospect, but added: ""The government needs to do much, much more to help a sector very much on its knees.""",Swissport is set to cut more than half of its UK workforce as air companies struggle with the effects of the coronavirus crisis.
"Net income fell to $3.11bn (£2.03bn) compared with a year ago for the personal computer giant. As its PC business continued to slow, the firm had relied on sales of its chips that go in data servers. But the firm said demand for its server-chips was slowing. However, Intel said its latest quarterly numbers were largely in line with expectations and that the results were ""solid"". ""We executed well in the third quarter and delivered solid results in a challenging economic environment,"" said Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich. The US-based firm also noted the introduction of its ""breakthrough 3D XPoint technology, the industry's first new memory category in more than two decades."" Acquisitions Reports have said that Intel's bid to buy Altera Corp for $6.7bn in an attempt to expand parts of its chip business could be given the go-ahead from the EU as soon as this week. The deal had been cleared by the US Department of Justice, but there were several antitrust issues surrounding it. Intel hoped that its buy-up of Altera would help boost its higher-margin chip business, particularly for data-servers - and help it focus on chips for cars and watches, among other devices. In a report released in line with its latest quarterly results, the firm said its outlook for the fourth quarter ""does not include the potential impact of any business combinations, asset acquisitions, divestitures, strategic investments and other significant transactions that may be completed after October 13.""","The world's biggest chipmaker, Intel, reported a 6% fall in net income for the three months to September and cut its fourth quarter outlook for its important server-chip business."
"But the bank warned it faced a ""tough year"" ahead as it continued to deal with the cost of restructuring the business and expected regulatory fines. The results mark a return to profit for the first time since last summer But RBS expects more fines and damages for mortgage mis-selling in the US. Operating profit was £1.5bn, up from £747m a year earlier, the bank added. Shares in RBS soared 10%, or 31.10p, to 337.70p in early trading on the London Stock Exchange. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the results showed the bank was in a ""steady state"". He promised RBS would be a bank ""that does a great job for customers while delivering good returns for our shareholders"". ""But we still have a lot of work to do and plenty of issues from the past to reckon with,"" he added. Expected losses Underlying profit at the bank stood at £1.2bn in the quarter, three times higher than a year earlier and as much as six times higher than the £200m to £300m range City analysts had forecast. But the bank - which remains 80% taxpayer-owned - cautioned that it still expected to make a loss for the year despite the profit in the first quarter. Aside from fines from legacy issues, the bank expects considerable costs from restructuring as it slims down from seven divisions to three. The bank added its results benefitted from its decision in November to hive off toxic assets into a bad bank at a cost of £4.5bn, which led to lower impairment charges, particularly at Ulster Bank. But the bank also benefitted from better cost control. It reported a cost-to-income ratio of 66%, down from 73% a year earlier. The bank is aiming to reduce the ratio to 55% by 2017 and 50% in 2020. The year ahead is still likely to be dogged by fines relating to legacy issues, particularly from abroad. In its annual results, RBS made a £1.9bn provision for fines and damages relating to mis-selling mortgage bonds in the US, as well as other penalties relating to market manipulation. But the bank fears the fines could exceed this amount. RBS is among several major banks assisting regulators around the world investigating allegations of collusion and price-rigging in the global currency market. Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said the bank's results appeared to ""represent the calm before the storm."" He added: ""The bank is still in the midst of dealing with its legacy issues, and has warned that there will be a considerable rise in costs as the year progresses, driven both by the restructure and the possibility of further regulatory fines. ""RBS is pursuing a similar route to Lloyds in preparing to simplify and focus its operations, but Lloyds is much further down the road."" Dividends In April, RBS agreed with the Treasury to cancel a deal which stopped it paying dividends to private shareholders. The deal was seen as a first step towards privatisation. The bank said it would seek permission from its shareholders at its annual general meeting (AGM) on 28 June to pay £1.5bn to cancel the so-called dividend access share (DAS) - £320m of it this year, and the rest by the beginning of 2016. The block on dividend payments to private investors was created in 2009 when the government bailed out the bank for a second time at a cost to the taxpayer of £25.5bn - taking the total cost of the RBS bailout to £45.5bn.","Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has reported pre-tax profits of £1.6bn for the three months to the end of March, almost double the profit recorded in the same quarter a year earlier."
"The bank said it was confident that the app was secure, after one of its previous applications was used by fraudsters to steal money. The new app will allow users to send a payment of up to £100 to anyone with a Visa card, by entering their mobile phone number. It is being gradually introduced, with a full launch planned after Easter. RBS and NatWest, part of the same banking group, said the app could be used to pay tradesmen. A plan to introduce an industry-wide mobile payments system is being drawn up by the UK Payments Council, and should be available from spring next year. Security The system will work in a similar way to sending a text message, with funds transferred at a similar speed to online banking. Recipients who are RBS or NatWest customers, and who have a Visa card, will see transfers put into their account automatically. Customers of other banks will be sent a text message and have to accept the payment by entering their details. A limit of £100 a day has been set, and if payments are repeated for several days in a row, they will eventually be blocked. A spokeswoman for the bank said lessons had been learnt from a security breach last year. Radio 4's Money Box programme heard from dozens of customers who told of how they had been defrauded by thieves using NatWest's Get Cash mobile phone application. This app allowed people to contact the bank to get a code, which then allowed them to withdraw cash from an ATM without a card. NatWest suspended the app while it beefed up security and promised to refund customers' losses. The bank's rival Barclays has already launched its Pingit app, which also allows adults with any UK current account to transfer small amounts of cash.",RBS has unveiled a new banking app which will allow customers to transfer money to contacts on their smartphone.
"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter The remarkable income stagnation for so many reveals that the economy has been failing to generate income for people over many years despite record levels of people in work. In 2003, households on the lower half of incomes typically earnt £14,900. In 2016/17 that figure had fallen to £14,800, the research shows. Both figures are adjusted for inflation and housing costs. There are over eight million low and middle income households, just under half of which have children. And it is not just poorer households which have been facing a pay squeeze. On average, incomes for all households in 2017/18 increased by just 0.9%, the lowest rise for four years and less than half the average between 1994 and 2007, just before the financial crisis. For the poorest third of households, incomes actually fell by up to £150 in the last year. The Resolution Foundation report said that surveys revealed that over 40% of low to middle income families feel they would be unable to save £10 a month and over 35% would be unable to afford a holiday for one week with their children. ""We appear to have a picture of generalised stagnation for many, with lower income households actually going backwards,"" the Resolution Foundation's Living Standards Audit says. ""The apparent falling away of the bottom from the middle in 2017/18 represents a disturbing new development. ""This pattern has clear implications for poverty - captured by the number of people living in households with incomes below 60% of the median [the middle figure of a set of income figures ranked from high to low]. ""There are good odds that 2017/18 delivered a notable increase [in poverty]. ""Relative child poverty may have risen to its highest rate in at least 15 years, despite high levels of employment."" ""Child poverty"" is calculated by the number of under-16s living in a household that earns less than 60% of the average income. The big questions are why the income stagnation has happened and what can be done about it. On the ""why"", research by the Foundation - which was set up to look at the problem of low incomes - reveals that the economy has struggled to create wealth for people in work. Although employment rates are high, which is good for those in work, many of the jobs are lower paid. That's because people who are moving from unemployment into employment, such as single parents, tend to take jobs towards the lower end of income levels. Once in jobs there is also a lack of ""progression"" into higher paid jobs. Productivity puzzle Productivity levels for the whole economy - the ability to create more value for every hour somebody works - have also been poor since the financial crisis. Rather than investing in new innovations - such as computer technology or robots which could increase the amount people produce - firms have been holding onto cash to get them through the tougher economic conditions. What are called ""non-wage costs"" have also increased. Businesses now have to pay more into employees' pensions and, for larger firms, have to pay costs such as the apprenticeship levy to encourage better standards of training. Managers have also been criticised for being too conservative about taking on new ways of working. Benefit cuts since 2010 also affect lower income households far more than those on higher incomes. Put those factors alongside the poor economic growth the UK has been experiencing, along with many other developed Western economies, since 2008 and the reasons behind the living standards problem become clearer. When it comes to solutions, the key is productivity. Economists argue that once in work, people should be encouraged to apply for promotions, increasing their skill levels and their pay. Firms should be encouraged to invest in innovations to make their firms more efficient and better able to create wealth for every hour worked. Better economic growth, which leads to higher incomes, is reliant on a number of factors - certainty about the future (in relatively low supply at present because of the Brexit process); global growth (Britain is an exporting nation so the better growth is elsewhere, the better for the UK); and investment in better and higher-value skilled jobs (which means focusing on education and skills and making managers better at exploiting opportunities that are available). Without a firm focus on such issues, the Resolution Foundation report reveals that, over the next decade, it is likely that ""just about managing"" families are likely to remain just that.","Millions of ""just about managing"" families are no better off today than those in 2003, new research from the Resolution Foundation indicates."
"Its total public debt now amounts to 120.1% of the annual output of its economy, up from 118.7% in 2010, the statistics agency Istat said. But Italy's annual budget deficit improved a bit, running at a rate of 3.9% last year, down from 4.6% in 2010. The economy, meanwhile, grew just 0.4% in 2011, brought down by a recession in the second half. In 2012, the economy is expected to contract by 0.4%. To compare, Germany's ratio of debt-to-GDP (GDP measures the size of its economy) is about 81% while Greece's is about 170%. Austerity programme Italy is considered to be in recession, which is usually defined as two successive quarters of negative growth, after its economy shrunk in the last six months of the year. However, for the year as a whole the country's gross domestic product grew 0.4% in 2011, Istat said. Italy has been hit hard by the eurozone debt crisis; soaring borrowing costs brought down the government of Silvio Berlusconi in November. Mario Monti took over at the head of a government of unelected technocrats, and has since passed a series of austerity reforms of tax increases, spending cuts and pension reforms aimed at balancing Italy's budget by 2013. Meanwhile, economic activity for the rest of Europe appears to still be subdued. The unemployment rate in the 17-nation eurozone continued to rise in January, hitting another record high, official Eurostat figures showed on Thursday. The Netherlands also entered recession in the fourth quarter of 2011. And Germany - Europe's largest economy - had its first quarter of negative growth since 2009 with a decline of 0.2%, compared with the previous quarter.","Italy's debt rose again in 2011, while its economy struggled to grow."
"By Tom BurridgeTransport correspondent, BBC News The incident led to the diversion of a Heathrow to Philadelphia flight, and a passenger being sent to hospital. Records show part of the aircraft had been leaking oil prior to the flight. BBC sources say it is likely the leak caused toxic fumes to enter the cabin. However, American Airlines denies that. 'Inconceivable' One assertion made in an internal American Airlines report on the incident on 21 October does stick out. It states that ""dish soap in a bottle caused two flight attendants to get medical attention and one passenger"". Dish soap is the American term for washing-up liquid. An American Airlines insider, who is not authorised to speak to the media, said it was ""inconceivable"" that dish soap, or any other cleaning product approved for use on aircraft, could cause two people to pass out. So far, American Airlines has not responded to the BBC's query on this specific point. In public statements the company has not used the term ""dish soap"", instead describing it as a ""cleaning solution"". It says the aircraft involved was ""thoroughly inspected"" after the incident by its ""highly-skilled"" maintenance team who conduct ""an in-depth investigation… whenever a cabin odour event is reported."" American Airlines says: ""Cabin odours are a priority for American's leadership team at the highest level of the organisation"", and insists the incident was caused by a cleaning agent which spilled mid-flight. 'Overpowering' smell However, BBC News has seen and heard evidence that casts doubt on that claim. Firstly, we've been told that a strange ""metallic"" odour was detected on the same aircraft before the cleaning solution spilled. The ""overpowering"" smell was detected on the previous flight, when the plane was travelling in the opposite direction from Philadelphia to Heathrow. We've also discovered that there was an oil leak on part of the aircraft days before the incident, which could have been the cause. The part of the plane that was leaking oil is called the Auxiliary Power Unit, or APU. The APU provides power to start up the engines and to run the electrics on the aircraft when the main engines are not running. Three days before the aircraft was diverted to Dublin, an engineering maintenance report stated that its APU showed a ""high oil consumption"". The leak meant it had guzzled an unusually large amount of oil, 31.75 pints, in the previous two weeks. Another American Airlines maintenance document stated that the APU was inoperable, and determined that it should be repaired in the coming days. A ""noxious odour"" which resulted in ""eye and throat irritation"" was also recorded on the same plane on 23 October, two days after the flight from Heathrow was diverted to Dublin. In another report from the same day, the APU on the plane is then described as ""wet with oil"". American Airlines claims the odour, which caused two cabin crew to pass out, ""was not related to the APU"" because the Auxiliary Power Unit was ""not operational during this time period and did not operate during this flight."" However, a document written by aircraft manufacturer Airbus clearly states that an APU, which has leaked oil, can contaminate the air supply in the cabin, even when the unit is switched off. The Airbus document, entitled ""APU bleed air oil contamination"", states that ""oil smell or smoke in the cabin resulting from APU oil contamination can occur at almost any time and not necessarily when the APU is running"". That's because if oil leaks from the APU it can spill into the ducting of the plane's air conditioning system. Fume events ""If an APU leaks oil then it goes into the ducting"", said Captain Tristan Loraine, a former British Airways pilot. ""So these guys have an APU leaking oil. They can fix the APU but they can't fix the contamination of the ducting."" Captain Loraine has spent years raising awareness about so-called ""fume events"", where oil or other fluids leak and potentially contaminate the air supply in the cabin mid-flight. The airline industry is generally reluctant to talk about the problem, and it is by no means an issue which is specific to American Airlines. The two cabin crew members who passed out on the flight from Heathrow are not authorised to speak to the BBC. However, we understand that nearly a month on from the incident, one of them is experiencing heavy migraines. Previously that person did not experience regular headaches. American Airlines said: ""It cannot be emphasised enough that the health and welfare of our crews and customers continues to be our top priority. ""However, in the case of this aircraft and the diversion to Dublin, there is no connection to the APU or bleed air from the APU.""","Documents seen by the BBC cast doubt on a claim by American Airlines that an ""odour"" on a flight, which led to two cabin crew falling unconscious, was due to ""a spilled cleaning solution""."
"The energy provider said it would apply for a judicial review against the regulator Ofgem, saying it had set the threshold too low. The firm said it wanted not to delay the cap, due to come in on 1 January, but to change how it is set. The regulator said it would defend its proposals ""robustly"". Ofgem proposed a cap on energy bills in September, following concerns that consumers were not getting best value for money from suppliers' default rates, or standard variable tariffs (SVT) . It means an average dual fuel customer who pays by direct debit should pay no more than £1,137 a year, £68 lower than British Gas's SVT. However, the policy has rattled some suppliers who say it will damage their profits and it has also been blamed for some smaller providers going bust. In November Centrica warned the cap would cost it £70m in lost operating profits in the first quarter of 2019. This was after British Gas shed 372,000 household accounts in the four months to the end of October as customers left its SVT. Centrica says that Ofgem had not properly taken into account the wholesale energy costs that ""all suppliers incur"" when it devised the cap. Explaining its decision to seek a judicial review, it said: ""Through this action Centrica has no intention to delay implementation of the cap, and does not expect the cap to be deferred in any way. ""As we have previously said, we do not believe that a price cap will benefit customers but we want to ensure that there is a transparent and rigorous regulatory process to deliver a price cap that allows suppliers, as a minimum, to continue to operate to meet the requirements of all customers."" Ofgem told the BBC that it ""carried out an extensive consultation process when setting the price cap and we believe that it offers consumers on poor value tariffs a fairer deal. ""In the event of a judicial review we would defend our proposals robustly."" The regulator says the new energy price cap could save 11 million customers an average of £76 a year on their gas and electricity bills. But it has already said that the level of the cap is likely to rise in April 2019, to reflect the higher cost of wholesale energy. As a result, the average annual saving in 2019 is likely to be lower.","British Gas owner Centrica is to mount a legal challenge against Britain's upcoming energy price cap, arguing it has not been calculated fairly."
"By Alexia O'ConnorBBC Radio 5 Live ""Right now, I feel very tired,"" she says. ""I feel cold, I feel groggy, I've got brain fog and I'm looking forward to getting some sleep."" Research for 5 Live Money has found that between 2007 and 2017, the number of retail workers working nights as their main shift pattern has gone up 50%. Almost 70,000 people now work mainly nights in the UK retail sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Workers like Amy who only do nights are still in a minority, making up just 3% of the workforce. But 27% also juggle changing shift patterns, which can include nights or early mornings. A decade ago, that number was 18%. Shopping habits Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth believes a huge change in our shopping habits is behind the increase in night working. ""Online is the biggest change in the sector and the requirement for delivery in 24 hours or less means more retailers are working shift patterns that will be across and through the night,"" she said. According to the latest figures from the ONS, 17.4 % of all shopping was carried out online in June this year. A decade ago, that figure was 2.7%. There have also been big changes in the make-up of the supermarket sector over the last decade. There's been a slow but steady increase in online grocery shopping, which is now worth £6.6bn in the UK and holds just over 6% of the market. Meanwhile, more convenience stores have opened which require deliveries of fresh food. The last 10 years has seen many more 24-hour supermarkets springing up, though that trend is now starting to change. Tesco, for instance, has recently reduced the number of stores open 24-seven and says it is increasingly moving towards late-night working and early-morning working to fill shelves. 'Not worth the sacrifice' The ONS figures also show the number of women who only or mainly work nights has gone up by 77% since 2007, though overall, more men than women work nights. Mum-of-three Amy said she started working two nights a week because she couldn't afford the childcare to cover a day job. She usually grabs a quick nap after work before taking the children to school. Her constant exhaustion has had a negative impact on family life, she says. ""It's not worth the sacrifice. The time I'm with my boys, I'm stressed and tired. I'm not myself."" School holidays are even harder. Amy said she can't afford to pay the £75 a day it would cost to put three children in a holiday club: ""When the kids are off I basically just don't get any sleep. I'll be home for six o'clock and usually they get up for about eight o'clock. And so yes, basically I stay awake."" Should employers allow staff to nap on a nightshift? Dr Helen McKenna from London's Royal Free Hospital has carried out research into optimising sleep on night shifts. ""Try to get a half-an-hour nap, if it is safe to do so and if your employer will allow it,"" she says.",It is 09:00 in the morning and Amy has just finished her night shift at a supermarket in Greater Manchester.

""Time to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval.""

"By Michael DempseyTechnology of Business reporter He is the chief executive of Evolv Technology, a US business based just outside Boston that is developing systems to search for firearms at major public events, and perhaps one day look for symptoms of Covid-19. Evolv has been asked if it can build arches into doorways and the company is examining ways to widen the space between sensors to allow larger crowds to go through more quickly. Mr George has a background in cybersecurity work that he says qualifies him for finding needles in haystacks. Evolv sells security arches that contain a combination of electronic surveillance and AI software to sift through signals and spot one gun-toting individual among thousands of people filing into a rock concert. This discreet technology was used to screen VIPs at this year's Brit Awards at London's O2 centre. Traditional metal detectors throw up a lot of alarms for innocent metallic objects, creating a chokepoint for paying customers who just want to get to their seat in a stadium or concert hall. This very high alarm rate prompted Evolv to blend AI software with radar to cut down on false alerts and keep the crowds flowing into a venue without irksome interruptions. This is not just looking for the shape of a gun as defined by the software, but also for small shards of metal packed into a confined space to create shrapnel around an explosive device as was tragically demonstrated in the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Evolv's software engineers have written algorithms that interpret shapes as signatures, with the outlines of knives and guns catalogued as reasons to alert an operator. The density of metal is one key indicator of a weapon's presence and Mr George says his colleagues have programmed the system to react in 1/38th of a second. The AI software analyses the results it gets from each crowd and this is uploaded automatically into Evolv's own database. Every arch sold is plumbed into Evolv's home archive via the internet. So it gets updated from other scanners. The system evolves as the user base grows, or as Mr George puts it, ""we can make everybody smarter as we share the data we collect."" Evolv hopes to add thermal imaging capabilities to its scanners in the course of 2020. In theory that could detect people with high temperatures, one of the symptoms of Covid-19. Dr Simon Worrell is an immunologist specialising in pandemic planning who works for health and security advice firm Collinson. He says the use of AI to assess human scans ""sounds good, but I just don't know how effective it will be"". Taking paracetamol, for example, will lower the temperature of a Covid-19 carrier. And basic precautions are still paramount. ""Physical distancing is important."" He thinks that adhering to layers of protection, temperature checks, masks and staying apart, is the way to beat the virus. Canadian threat protection specialist Patriot One Technologies has directed its AI team to research how its existing systems, built to identify one person carrying a gun in a crowd, can be tuned to pick up people with raised temperatures. But Martin Cronin, chief executive of Patriot One and a former British Foreign Office diplomat, urges caution. ""It's not that easy to detect temperatures. You can't just point a thermal camera at a crowd. Factors like the ambient temperature or whether someone has a raised temperature due to exercise can undermine the accuracy of scanning devices. People should be wary of bold claims to have answers to temperature scanning."" Part of the challenge is tuning AI software to ignore such distractions and isolate the indicators that are important to keeping virus carriers out of crowded places. Patriot One wants to pin down a range of anomalies, including the absence of approved face masks, that mean a visitor merits further attention. It's been difficult enough training the systems to look for concealed weapons. Patriot One found that radar did a fine job of peeking underneath coats and jackets to find what it thought were weapons. Unfortunately the number of false alerts was unreasonably high. AI was drafted in to help, in the form of machine-learning technology that could sort out the shapes caught on the radar scan and assess whether they really represented a threat. With a boost from AI the success rate rose, but it still wasn't up to a stage where it could be unleashed on the public without common objects getting confused with the tools of a terrorist. The system was only working well in some environments, while in others the signals became cluttered by outside elements such as emissions from consumer electronics. More Technology of Business The answer was yet more technology. Patriot One bought several companies, with additional AI and detection expertise. Video images of guns and knives were fed into the AI software teaching it to discriminate between different objects. And the company has connected its surveillance technology to security cameras suspended in familiar transparent bulges from corridor ceilings in customer sites. Mr Cronin brought the AI ingredients together, pooling the data from different systems. He likens it to the way humans combine all of their senses to understand the world around them. He claims the AI software has now eliminated interference from building noise and electronic signals, deleting the false positives that dogged early trials. And he presents the technology as leaving individuals anonymous. ""We look for objects, not people."" But the algorithms that underpin smart systems can be foxed by mundane events. At one high school campus in the US a gun detection scanner was perplexed by the sudden appearance of umbrellas on a day of heavy rain. Retrained to identify an umbrella as a non-threatening object the software could then be updated across Patriot One's user network. Different societies throw up different problems. In North America the priority is to detect guns. For prospective UK users the system may be looking for knives. But in both cases the idea is to install unobtrusive security architecture. So the next time you stroll into a corporate reception area or the entrance of a public building, cast a glance at those big planters that frame the door as you walk in. You might just have been checked out for weapons. Or perhaps, one day, a virus.","Peter George calls it the protection paradox. People want to have safety, but they don't want to spend a long time queuing for a security inspection."

"The EU's Competition Commission said Qualcomm had ""prevented rivals from competing in the market"". Qualcomm said it would appeal against the fine. Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Qualcomm had ""illegally shut out rivals"" from the market for more than five years. She said that Qualcomm had paid billions of dollars so that Apple would exclusively use its technology in iPhones and iPads. As a result, no rival could challenge Qualcomm in this market, ""no matter how good their products were"", she added. Ms Vestager said Qualcomm's behaviour ""denied consumers and other companies more choice and innovation"". In a statement Qualcomm said it strongly disagreed with the decision and would immediately appeal against it to the General Court of the European Union.

The company denied the allegations saying the case was ""flawed"". The commission sued Qualcomm for unfair practices in the way it licenses its technology - especially the processors used in cell phones and other devices. Last November the company rejected a $103bn (£79bn) takeover bid from rival Broadcom. Qualcomm said the offer, which is potentially the largest tech sector takeover to date, ""dramatically undervalued"" the company.",The world's biggest maker of mobile phone chips has been fined €997m ($1.2bn; £870m) by European authorities for paying Apple to use its chips.
"The Local Data Company, which studied the top 500 British town centres, said 2,564 outlets closed in the first half of 2017, equivalent to 14 a day. At the same time, there were 2,342 store openings, meaning that a net total of 222 High Street shops disappeared. Charity shops, women's clothes shops and shoe shops were worst hit, it said. However, general fashion stores, banks and cheque cashing shops saw their lowest number of net closures in three years. Some sectors actually recorded growth, with tobacconists, coffee shops and beauty salons increasing in number. Ice-cream parlours are also on the up, thanks to expansion by the Ben & Jerry's and Kaspa's chains. 'Uncertain' outlook Mike Jervis, a retail specialist at PwC which commissioned the research, said the ""relatively low"" number of closures over the period reflected a ""more stable environment"". However, he warned: ""The environment is, of course, uncertain, with recent data showing a more challenging retail environment. I expect net store closures to be an ongoing feature of the market. ""Retailers will choose specific closure stores very carefully and will aim to capitalise on leases expiring in the ordinary course of their businesses."" The store closures were unevenly spread across the country. Scotland fared worst, with a net loss of 42 shops, while eastern England lost 34. Only two out of 11 British regions showed net gains: Yorkshire and the Humber, which added 12 shops, and the East Midlands, which now has eight more shops.","The number of High Street shops closing down has fallen to its lowest level in seven years, research suggests."
"London-focused estate agent Foxtons saw profits plunge 64% in the first six months of this year. Another estate agent, Countrywide, also saw profits tumble, also saw profits tumble, by 98% in its case. The firm said it would not pay a dividend. Foxton's head Nic Budden said demand had slowed due to ""unprecedented economic and political uncertainty"". House price surveys this year have consistently pointed to a slowdown in both house price inflation and transactions, as political uncertainty combines with a squeeze in household incomes to hold back buyers. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the reluctance of sellers to make a move had left estate agents with the lowest stock of properties for nearly 40 years. Cost cuts Countrywide, whose shares fell to a record low in the wake of the announcement, said house sales exchanges were down 20%, 24% in London. Countrywide said the first six months of this year were also tough in comparison with last year, which saw high levels of housing transactions brought forward to beat an increase in stamp duty changes and ahead of the EU referendum. Its profits were £447,000, down from £24.3m. Both agents are making deep cost cuts. Foxtons pre-tax profits fell to £3.8m, down from £10.5m for the same period last year. Revenues fell 15% to £58.5m. Foxtons said in its statement that there had been further cooling of the market in the second quarter of 2017, with the unexpected general election a factor in slowing activity. It added that London was more greatly affected than the rest of the country. Foxtons has been warning since 2014 that rapid price growth and strong demand in London had started to cool. However, it said that in the longer term, it expected London to remain an attractive property market for sales and lettings.",Two of the country's estate agent chains have posted slumping profits in the face of a slowing housing market.
"By Mike WendlingReporter, 5 live Investigates Criminal and civil charges filed in New York have forced online poker sites PokerStars (based in the Isle of Man) and Full Tilt Poker (based in Alderney, in the Channel Islands), as well as Canada-based Absolute Poker, to stop doing business with Americans. It is the latest upheaval for the industry, which over the last decade has grown from nothing into one that rakes in an estimated $5bn (£3.25bn) each year and is regulated in vastly different ways in countries around the world. America is the biggest market, with up to a million online players. Gambling laws vary from state to state, but in 2006, the US federal government attempted to put the brakes on online poker with the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA). The UIGEA was meant to halt money transfers to online gaming sites, and several big poker sites, wary of running foul of the law, pulled out of the American market. However the three companies named in the indictment continued to welcome US-based customers. Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking at least $3bn (£1.8bn) in civil money laundering penalties. If convicted, the 11 men named in the indictment face possible prison time and huge fines. As a result of this latest scandal, the share prices of competing poker sites, which have already turned down business from US players, have experienced a significant jump. 'Elaborate' fraud Prosecutors accuse the companies and alleged co-conspirators of concocting dozens of fake corporations - purportedly selling items such as clothing, golf clubs and pet food - to collect money from US players. After American financial institutions got wise to the trick, the indictment alleges, the companies decided to change strategy. Prosecutors say they managed to persuade several small local banks that were facing financial difficulties to process poker-related transactions, by promising fees and fresh investment cash. In one case, the indictment says, PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker took a 30% stake in a Utah bank, SunFirst, and used it to process $200m (£123m) in poker funds. ""These defendants concocted an elaborate criminal fraud scheme, alternately tricking some U.S. banks and effectively bribing others to assure the continued flow of billions in illegal gambling profits,"" Manhattan US attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. ""Moreover, as we allege, in their zeal to circumvent the gambling laws, the defendants also engaged in massive money laundering and bank fraud."" A court order seized poker company funds in 76 bank accounts in 14 countries. The companies also had their .com domain names seized - the usual images of chips, cards and superstar poker players replaced by blunt legal statements and the FBI logo. On Wednesday, the prosecutors announced that they would be handing back control of the .com domain names to PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker so that the companies could refund their US customers. Negative attention Aaron Todd, a senior editor for industry news site Casino City Times, said the poker companies were caught off-guard by the indictment despite years of openly challenging the US law. ""If you're a big player in an industry as big as poker, with laws in place designed to stop what you're doing, it's not that surprising that the authorities are going after you,"" Mr Todd said. He says that estimates suggest a large proportion of players on the British sites actually come from the US - perhaps up to half of all players on the Alderney-based Full Tilt poker site. Mr Todd says the indictments will hit the incomes of big-name American players who reap endorsement money on top of their poker winnings, but also lesser-known ""grinders"" - low stakes players who squeeze out smaller profits over time. ""At this point, a lot of players have lost two main places they play. ""There are some sites that are still open for US play, but people will be wary of playing on those sites, as they too could close to American players or face similar legal action."" Last year, 5 live Investigates reported on a ring of Chinese poker players who colluded to rip off players on the Isle of Man-based PokerStars site. PokerStars refunded $2.1m (£1.3m) to customers across the world after the scam was uncovered. That case was not an isolated one. The company had previously refunded $80,000 (£52,000) to players who unwittingly played against poker ""bots"" - automatic card-playing software programmes. And in 2007 Absolute Poker refunded $1.6m (£985,000) after it was alleged that a company insider cheated customers. 'Black Friday' However, this latest indictment, unsealed last week, could cost the companies far more than cheating scandals ever did. PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker blocked US customers after the FBI's action on what poker players are calling ""Black Friday"" on blogs and in online forums. However, players elsewhere in the world have continued to use the online card rooms after the company websites were moved to .eu domains, outside the reach of American authorities. An e-mail sent to PokerStars players said: ""It is business as usual for all players outside the USA …you can rest assured that player balances are safe."" In a statement released after the indictments were unsealed, Full Tilt said it was ""saddened"" by the charges. The company added: ""Full Tilt Poker believe online poker is legal and has always has been committed to preserving the integrity of the game and abiding by the law."" Absolute Poker did not respond to the BBC's inquiries. Aaron Todd of Casino City Times says the indictments could potentially lead to more political pressure to relax online gambling laws in America.

"Walgreens Boots Alliance said it would take ""decisive steps"" to reduce costs as part of a company-wide ""significant restructuring"". The move comes after the chain said it had suffered its ""most difficult quarter"" since the firm's formation, with UK like-for-like sales down 2.3%. The chain has 2,485 stores across the UK, employing about 56,000 staff. The firm said a store portfolio review was under way across the global business. But Boots in the UK said there were no plans for major reductions, adding that it had managed to maintain its market share in the most recent quarter. ""We currently do not have a major programme envisaged, but as you'd expect, we always review underperforming stores and seek out opportunities for consolidation,"" it said. 'More aggressive' Chief executive Stefano Pessina said market challenges had ""accelerated"" in the three months to the end of February, but that it had failed to respond rapidly enough ""resulting in a disappointing quarter"". ""We are going to be more aggressive in our response to these rapidly shifting trends,"" he added. Actions announced include ""optimising its store footprint"" and increasing its planned annual cost savings from $1bn to $1.5bn. The cost cuts follow Boots' announcement in February that 350 jobs were at risk in its Nottingham head office, amid plans to reduce costs by 20%. Overall earnings for the firm's second quarter were down 14.3% compared to the same period last year. The company said it was now expecting profit to be flat for the full year, down from its earlier guidance of 7% to 12% growth. Maureen Hinton, global retail research director at market research firm GlobalData, said Boots in the UK was struggling to compete with beauty brands such as Charlotte Tilbury, Chanel and Dior which had developed their own stores which offered ""a more indulgent and luxury experience"". ""Boots is quite a commodity place, people go for practicalities such as health and toiletries, but it's not really exploiting trends in beauty. The stores are also looking a bit tired,"" she added. Tough conditions Boots is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought. The increasing popularity of online shopping, higher business rates, rising labour costs and the fall in the pound following the Brexit vote - which has increased the cost of imported goods - have been blamed for contributing to retailers' woes. Walgreens Boots Alliance was formed in 2014 after Walgreens bought the 55% stake in UK and Switzerland-based Boots Alliance that it did not already own.",The US owner of pharmacy chain Boots has warned of possible store closures in the UK as it tries to cut costs.
"By Katy Watson and Sarah TreanorBBC News, California and Mexico Their business is called Coalo Valley Farms but it couldn't be any further from a picture of agrarian life. The warehouse holds thousands of ""micro livestock"" as co-founder and chief executive Elliot Mermel calls them. That's crickets and mealworms to you and me. This is California's first insect farm for human consumption and its owners have grand plans. ""We know that insects are a sustainable source of protein - and while the world already struggles to feed seven billion, we want to try and help find a way to feed the future generations,"" says Elliot. Eco-friendly creepy crawlies The ecologically and environmentally sound principles of the venture in drought-stricken California are especially important to Elliot and his team. He refers to the operation as ""closed-loop"" - which means almost everything is generated by the farm. The fish they farm provide wastewater that feeds the green shoots of alfalfa and mung beans, which in turn feed the crickets. The ""farm"" looks more like a cannabis lab, which is funny because the team at Coalo actually borrowed the technology from the industry. Silver-covered tents that are heated and inside them, rows and rows of tubs and racks of insects. The company, which has only been operating since 2015, has fans in the health food and protein bar markets. But is insect eating - or entomophagy - seriously going to catch on? Struggling industry in Mexico South of the border in Mexico, where bugs have been consumed since pre-Hispanic times, the answer is more complex than it might first appear. While culturally there isn't a widespread aversion to bug-eating - as there may be in the US - insects purposefully grown, such as those at Coalo Valley Farms, do not exist. Rene Cerritos is an evolutionary biologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. He's a firm fan of creepy crawlies and works with farmers to try to encourage bug production. He explains that of the 2,000 edible insect species in the world, Mexico has about a quarter of them - more than any other country. Yet demand is low. ""Westerners have a real issue consuming insects and that's the problem,"" says Rene. ""Mexico is Westernising and so lots of traditions have been lost that we had since pre-Hispanic times. The insects are there, tonnes and tonnes of them - millions. And we could harvest and consume them but we don't do it."" Pests hit profit While in California they are growing crickets, in Mexico it's grasshoppers that are consumed. There are subtle physical differences and crickets are omnivores while grasshoppers are vegetarians. Grasshoppers in Mexico are considered pests. They attack crops and reduce production, costing farmers dear. As a result, Jose Moreno Sanchez is thinking outside the box. A farmer for 30 years, three years ago he came up with a different strategy. ""The grasshoppers ate crops and the financial damage was bad, especially when sowing vegetables. So we decided to make business out of grasshoppers instead of fighting them,"" he says. Jose explains that the vast majority of grasshoppers are harvested informally. People who collect them don't own the land - they trample on the crops with their nets, angering farmers. And then sell their catch elsewhere. The fact that farmers are so reluctant to embrace the bugs is a shame, says chef and food critic Alejandro Escalante. He reels off a list of insects he likes to cook with at his restaurant, La Casa del los Tacos, in the south of Mexico City - the small maggots called agave worms, scorpions and ticks, to name but a few. They're delicious, he adds, crunching on a tick from the mesquite tree. ""They're high in protein, they're tasty and there's a huge variety.""

Mexico's caviar The San Juan market in the heart of Mexico City is testimony to that variety. The large warehouse is a gastronomic experience and home to a mind-boggling number of meat products including crocodile, ostrich and the more standard lamb, pork and chicken. But those cuts, which are stacked high on tables or hanging whole from huge hooks, rub shoulders with smaller livestock: tarantulas, scorpions, grasshoppers and agave worms - some of which are still pink and wriggling. These insects don't come cheap though. And the lure of the potential profits on offer is one of the reasons that Alessandro Spagnuolo and his family started farming delicacies such as ant eggs or ""escamoles"" - known as the caviar of Mexico. From delicacy to everyday food? Alessandro runs the bug-focused company JCRedon. We met up at his family farm in Hidalgo, and they took us on a trek to find ant egg nests and agave plants that had worms in. This season has been tough - few plants have been found, which perhaps explains the price. Worms can fetch about $100 (£76) a kilo. Their exclusivity is part of their charm for their well-heeled foodie fans but Alessandro is confident that his products will soon become more mainstream and export to Europe will one day be a reality. At the moment, regulations don't allow the export of insects for human consumption from Mexico to Europe. ""It's like sushi,"" says Alessandro, echoing a comparison made by Alejandro Escalante in his restaurant. ""Twenty years ago hardly anyone in Europe thought raw fish was OK to eat - now it's everywhere. It's the same with insects."" Back in LA, Elliot and his band of micro livestock farmers are finding their customers like to take their product ""de-legged"" and often in powder form. Perhaps the idea of ordering a bug on a plate from a waiter or having a snack pot of crickets at home is still a hop too far for most outside of bug-eating cultures.

"Markus Braun resigned last Friday after auditor EY refused to sign off the firm's 2019 accounts over a missing €1.9bn (£1.7bn). The money accounts for about a quarter of the firm's total balance sheet. Prosecutors accuse Mr Braun of inflating Wirecard's finances to make it appear healthier to investors and customers. Mr Braun reported himself to Munich prosecutors on Monday evening after a judge issued an arrest warrant against the 50-year old. The missing €1.9bn was supposedly held in accounts at two Asian banks and had been set aside for ""risk management"", Wirecard had said. But EY said after an audit of the business that banks had been unable to provide the account numbers for where the money was held. On Monday, Wirecard admitted the €1.9bn simply may not exist. The German company also said it was withdrawing its financial results for 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. ""The management board of Wirecard assesses on the basis of further examination that there is a prevailing likelihood that the bank trust account balances in the amount of 1.9 billion EUR do not exist,"" the company said in a statement. Mr Braun had been in charge of the German fin-tech firm since 2002. When Wirecard joined Germany's blue-chip Dax 30 share index two years ago it was valued at €24bn. But the company's shares have crashed more than 80% in recent days giving it a stock market valuation of less than €3bn. The scandal at the firm emerged after a series of articles in the Financial Times last year focusing on alleged accounting irregularities in Wirecard's Asian operations.",The ex-boss of scandal-hit payments firm Wirecard has been arrested in Germany.
"It was the deepest decline since the government began keeping records in 1947 and three times more severe than the prior record of 10% set in 1958. Reduced spending on services such as healthcare drove the fall. Economists have said they expected to see the sharpest drop in the second quarter, with recovery thereafter. But as virus cases in the US surge and some areas re-impose restrictions on activity, the rebound is showing signs of stalling. More than 1.4 million people filed new claims for unemployment last week, up slightly from the prior week for the second week in a row. Other data points to spending cuts and falls in confidence in July. Job losses Jerome Powell, the head of America's central bank, on Wednesday warned of renewed slowdown, describing the downturn as the ""most severe in our lifetimes"". He urged further government spending to help American households and businesses weather the crisis. That call was echoed by other business leaders on Thursday as the figures brought into focus the scale of the economic crisis facing the country. ""The staggering news of the historic decline of the gross domestic product in the second quarter should shock us all,"" said Neil Bradley, chief policy officer at the US Chamber of Commerce, a business lobby group. ""This jarring news should compel Congress to move swiftly."" The International Monetary Fund has predicted that global growth will fall by 4.9% this year. On Thursday, Germany reported a record quarterly decline of 10.1%, while Mexico's economy also reported a double digit contraction. Compared with the same quarter a year ago, the US economy contracted 9.5%. Exports and imports were both down more than 20% from a year ago, while consumer spending - the main driver of the US economy - fell 10.7% year-on-year. 'No signs of getting back to normal' New York City pub owner Anthony LoPorto has been serving drinks at his Bean Post venue since 1994. He's never known it so bad. After waiting months to re-open, he is now struggling to fill his tables as people worried about the virus or loss of income stay home. It is a drop-off in trade that is magnified across the US - a reason why the GDP numbers were so bad. ""This is now going on for months and we were told that there would be an opportunity for us to start getting back to some normalcy around this time - there's no signs of normalcy whatsoever,"" he says. ""I have a 'don't stop, won't stop' type of attitude... but it's getting to a point where I'm nervous and I've got to be honest - I'm nervous that even if I continue to go on, what's going to happen with the neighbourhood?"" The more offices that close or keep staff at home, the more the Bean Post's custom dwindles. ""I don't believe in a quick bounce-back at all,"" he says. ""This is a long time that people have not been making money. ""There are nights when there's just nobody around... There's just not enough money in people's pockets and not enough want in people's spirits."" The US has lost nearly 15 million jobs since February, despite strong hiring in May and June. The US census estimates more than half of American adults live in households that have seen incomes cut since the pandemic. Economists warned it will take years for the US to recover from the devastation. ""Even when the economy saw rapid bounce-back in May and June, the Covid-19 economic shock inflicted so much damage in earlier months that the net result was an economic catastrophe for the second quarter,"" wrote Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. Congress is debating another economic relief package but it seems unlikely to reach a deal before an emergency $600 supplement to unemployment benefits expires this week, threatening another economic shock. ""The fact that initial jobless claims have risen for a second week is worrying and underscores that the nascent consumption recovery is at risk,"" said Madhavi Bokil, vice president of Moody's Investors Service.",The US economy shrank at a 32.9% annual rate between April and June as the country grappled with lockdowns and spending cutbacks during the pandemic.
"Ireland is considering the proposed deal in terms of its effects on competition, transport links, and jobs, its transport ministry said. The Irish government has a 25.1% share in Aer Lingus, and must agree to any deal before it can go through. Ryanair has a 29.8% stake in the airline, and also has a power of veto. Irish transport minister Paschal Donohoe said the government would give the proposed deal ""very careful examination"" before taking a decision. ""There are important considerations to be taken into account in addition to price,"" he said. The effects on competition in the market, transport links to Europe and the US, and jobs associated with those transport links must be taken into account before a decision is made, a spokesman for the department said. Aer Lingus deal Irish airline Aer Lingus has said it is willing to accept a €1.36bn (£1bn) takeover offer from British Airways owner IAG. But Aer Lingus said before it formally recommends the offer, IAG must ""address the interests of relevant parties"". That is thought to mean its two biggest shareholders - the Irish government and Ryanair - and the unions. The Irish cabinet held its weekly meeting on Tuesday, where the IAG offer was discussed. In a statement, Aer Lingus said: ""The board has indicated to IAG that the financial terms are at a level at which it would be willing to recommend [the offer] subject to being satisfied with the manner in which IAG proposes to address the interests of relevant parties"". Aer Lingus also stressed that IAG plans to operate Aer Lingus as a separate business, with its own brand, management and operations, should the takeover go ahead. The trade union representing most Aer Lingus staff, Impact, has said that a takeover could lead to the loss of up to 1,200 jobs - a quarter of the workforce. IAG's primary interest in the Irish carrier is its 23 pairs of take-off and landing slots at Heathrow airport - valued at about £30m apiece - allowing it to operate more flights. Ireland's deputy prime minister warned at the weekend that protecting the country's air links with Europe and the US was vitally important in terms of inward investment, exports, business and tourism. Joan Burton told RTE Radio: ""What we will want to do as a government, and what's absolutely important, is to protect these slots and the connections of direct flights in and out of Ireland."" Previous bids Aer Lingus directly employs 3,900 people, mostly in Dublin, with 2,100 of these described as ground staff in areas such as clerical, operative and back office roles. A takeover may also face competition concerns from European regulators. If IAG, which owns Spanish carrier Iberia, was forced to sell some Heathrow landing slots owned by Aer Lingus it could undermine the rationale for the deal. Aer Lingus is the fourth-largest operator at Heathrow after BA, Lufthansa and Virgin Atlantic. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor Here's what I believe to be IAG's game plan. On Aer Lingus, IAG has revealed that the airline will remain as a separate entity with its own brand and own management. That will allay concerns within Aer Lingus that IAG would swallow up the airline as it did with the old British Midland carrier, bmi. That loss making airline, formerly owned by Lufthansa, became part of BA. And given that Aer Lingus has already been through a significant restructuring and is making money, any efficiency drive (and IAG's chief executive, Willie Walsh, is famous for them) will be limited. For Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, the chief executive, will want to ensure that he receives the best price possible for his 30% stake. But given that he is likely to be a willing seller following competition concerns over the size of his holding, IAG will argue that €2.55 a share is not too shabby. Ahmed: IAG in Irish charm offensive In a separate statement, IAG said that Aer Lingus had now allowed it access to its financial books to ""perform a limited period of confirmatory due diligence"". IAG's offer is worth €2.55 a share. Aer Lingus had rejected two previous IAG offers - pitched at €2.30 and €2.40 a share. Aer Lingus shares were up 1.9% at €2.41 in afternoon trading on Tuesday, while IAG shares were also up 2.2% at 561p. Ryanair built its stake in Aer Lingus as part of three failed attempts to buy the carrier. Competition regulators blocked the takeover bids and told Ryanair it must sell all but 5% of its shareholding. However, an immediate sale was delayed by a lengthy appeals process. Robin Byde, a transport analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald stockbrokers, said IAG was seeking to build on Aer Lingus's lucrative niche on transatlantic routes, which offers customs and immigration clearance in Dublin and Shannon for flights to the US. But he was wary about the politics of the deal and the potential for IAG to get ""dragged into prolonged and distracting negotiations"".",The Irish government is looking at a revised offer for airline Aer Lingus from British Airways owner IAG.
"""Every Viennese cafe, every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation,"" Mr Kern told Der Standard. ""That goes for Starbucks, Amazon and other companies,"" he said.

He praised the European Commission's recent order that Apple should pay 13bn euros (£11bn) more in tax to Ireland. On Tuesday, the European Commission decided after a long investigation that Apple should pay the 13bn euros in extra tax, plus interest, to the Irish government because a long-standing tax deal with the US tech giant amounted to illegal state aid.

""You saw some pretty big dislocations in financial markets last week, in particular in dollar financial markets which of course are global by nature.

'Very focused' Asked if the impact of the global pandemic on the economy would be more significant than the Bank's words last week that the effect would be ""large, sharp but temporary"", Mr Bailey, said the Bank was consulting epidemiologists [people who study disease outbreaks] to try to help work out the economic impact. ""There's two parts. First of all, of course, is how long Covid itself is going to go on for, obviously that's not something that as a central bank, we have an expertise in. We're working very closely with epidemiologists to understand that. That will obviously have an effect on the economy, no question about that. ""The second part - which we emphasised last week - which we are very keen also to ensure doesn't happen is that the economic effects that materialise during the period of Covid then get extended onwards by virtue of effectively the damage that's done to the economy and that's something that we want to want to minimise and stop. And that's why you saw prompt action last week."" The governor acknowledged that he was ""going to be very, very focused on on the response to Covid, that's the key thing at the moment. We need to get through that period"".

Its director general, Jonathan Geldart, said it was vital the guidance was clear so that companies could plan how to return safely. ""As people with ultimate legal responsibility, directors need to have confidence that it's safe, and that if they act responsibly they won't be at undue risk. Businesses should consult with their people to put in place robust policies, which in many cases might not be an overnight process."" Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said businesses were ""keen to open and get the economy back on its feet"". ""But they also know putting health first is the only sustainable route to economic recovery. The message of continued vigilance is right,"" she said. She added: ""While stopping work was necessarily fast and immediate, restarting will be slower and more complex. It must go hand in hand with plans for schools, transport, testing and access to PPE. Firms will want to see a roadmap, with dates they can plan for."" Difficult path ahead Very little has changed in terms of the regulations and prohibitions first announced in March. The lockdown remains. Closed shops, for example, won't reopen. What we did get was a ""change of emphasis"" - that people should assume they should go back to work, rather than presume they should not. Some in government and in industry fear that the ""stay at home"" message has now deeply embedded itself in the minds of millions of workers. The prime minister's replacement of that message with ""stay alert"" in England is designed to get businesses to use the existing discretion in the lockdown regulations. The practicalities of that are not easy, however, with business groups and unions not agreeing on what constitutes a ""Covid-safe"" workplace. The government acknowledges that there won't be enough public transport options for people to return to work. Many workers will also face problems with childcare. On top of that, to the extent that some industries will reopen - such as construction and perhaps some forms of hospitality by July, any increase in the rate of infection could see the brakes applied quickly. The path ahead will be a delicate, difficult and constant balancing act between health and the economy. For now, the economy is definitively second priority. During his address, Mr Johnson added that workplaces would receive guidance on how to become ""Covid secure"". Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, called for those guidelines to be published. BBC News previously reported that reduced hot-desking and alternatives to social distancing where it is not possible were among measures being considered to let workplaces reopen. One of seven draft plans to ease anti-coronavirus restrictions, seen by the BBC, also urged employers to minimise numbers using equipment, stagger shift times and maximise home-working. Many companies have been shut since widespread limits on everyday life were imposed on 23 March, in a bid to limit the effects of the virus's spread on the NHS. As a result, the government is now paying the wages for nearly a quarter of UK jobs under a programme aimed at helping people put on leave due to the virus pandemic. Under the job retention scheme, it funds 80% of workers' wages, up to £2,500 a month. On Sunday, business groups also urged caution when it came to any future withdrawal of the support.

"Just over 4.18 million vehicles were sold in the first half of the year. That was an 8% increase on second-hand sales in the first half of 2015, and the first time that any half-year sales have risen above the four million mark. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the increase mirrored the rising number of new cars sold in the past few years. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said: ""The UK's used car market is at its strongest ever."" ""The growth in the used car market has reflected the record demand for new cars in recent years, but future growth in high-cost purchases will depend on stable consumer and business confidence,"" he added. Outstripping Car sales are widely seen as a key indicator of economic activity and consumers' willingness to spend money. The half-year rise in second-hand sales was far in excess of the growth of the wider economy, or of people's incomes. It was also higher than the 3% rise in first-half sales of new cars. The trade body's figures show that in the first five years following the 2008 financial crisis, and the subsequent economic recession, second-hand car sales fell sharply, and then stood still. At one point the government had to bring in a scrappage scheme to encourage people to continue buying new cars, and to stop the industry from potential collapse. Since then new car sales have revived strongly, hitting a new record high in 2015, and for the past three years second-hand sales have been picking up too. The SMMT said that the most popular second-hand cars were those between one and three-years old, super-minis, and small family cars.",The number of second-hand cars sold in the UK has reached its highest level yet.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The extension, announced as the initial 28-day suspension expired, means investors will have to wait at least another month to withdraw their money. Investors in the Equity Income Fund have now not been able to access their money since 3 June. Withdrawals were frozen after rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. ""It remains in the best interests of all investors in the fund to continue the suspension,"" Link, the regulated manager of the fund, said in a letter to investors posted on its website. The next update on the fund will be before 29 July, the next formal deadline for a review. Mr Woodford fuelled speculation that the fund could be locked for a long period, by reiterating that there is no ""prescribed limit"" to the suspension in a video statement to investors. ""Of course, we understand that people want access to their money, they are very frustrated by not being able to deal in the fund. But we are using the time . . . to ensure we get the right outcomes for our investors,"" he added. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at investment platform AJ Bell said it was now ""imperative"" that Mr Woodford communicated clearly with investors on progress. ""While this is difficult given liquidity is a moving target, investors deserve to be kept fully informed as the portfolio is repositioned."" Mr Hughes said the fund's performance had continued to deteriorate since the suspension, dropping 4% compared to a 3% rise in the FTSE All Share over the same period. Celebrated Mr Woodford is one of the UK's biggest names in stockpicking - which is when a fund manager analyses the potential of different stocks to try to decide whether or not they will make a good investment. He was widely celebrated for previous success, and backed until the suspension by huge investment supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown - but both now face questions over how business was conducted amid criticism from investors. 'We don't expect to see our money soon' Investor Claire Jebson and her husband have some of their money locked up in the Woodford fund. It was supposed to be used to help pay for son Sam's university education which is due to start in September. However, she does not expect her money to be unlocked for another six to 12 months - missing the planned start of his studies. ""We didn't know this block could happen - our mistake. It is good that we all are aware now, but sad that this had to happen for us to find out,"" she said, echoing the views of many investors. ""We do have a back-up plan and I am sure others are in a worse position."" Paul Madon, from Leicester, said he expected the value of the investment to drop sharply when the suspension is eventually lifted. ""I thought [the Woodford fund] would be boringly safe. It was not,"" the 67-year-old said. ""I will get out as soon as I can, and take the loss."" Stuart Evans, who is saving for his grandchildren and spoke of his frustration with Hargreaves Lansdown last month, also said he expected to take a ""big hit"" when the fund eventually reopens. What happened to the Woodford fund? When the fund launched five years ago, Mr Woodford's previous record meant thousands of investors trusted him with their money. At its peak, the Woodford Equity Income Fund managed £10.2bn worth of assets, such as local authority pension funds. In its first year, there were returns of 18% on investors' money, compared with an average rise of only 2% on the London Stock Exchange at the time. However, far from uniquely, this was followed by struggles in the last couple of years. As a result, the fund has brought very little return for investors who have been in it throughout. Figures from FE Analytics show the fund has made a total return of 0.36% since its launch. It also meant that investors pulled out at an increasingly rapid rate. The fund now manages £3.7bn, according to the financial services and research firm Morningstar. Owing to this ""increased level of redemptions"", Mr Woodford and his backers said investors would not be allowed to ""redeem, purchase or transfer shares"" in the fund. In effect, it was suspended while they reordered the fund. There has been criticism that, in the meantime, Mr Woodford has continued to charge management fees to customers. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Treasury Committee of MPs, said fees should be halted while trading in the fund was suspended.","Well-known stockpicker Neil Woodford's flagship fund will remain locked for investors, it has been confirmed."
"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News Yet pub trade body the British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) has warned the resulting changes will be ""hugely damaging"" to the industry and could result in 7,000 job losses. We present both sides of the argument and look at what will actually change as a result of the vote. Most crucially, what does it mean for the price of beer? What is a beer tie anyway? There are two ways of setting up a pub - an individual or group can set it up independently, meaning they have to pay the going market rate for rents etc, but leaving them free to buy supplies, such as alcohol and food, from whoever they like. The alternative is a tied option meaning that they rent the premises from the pub company or brewery that owns it. The rent and insurance and other items, referred to as ""dry rent"", are then typically lower than the actual market rate. In exchange for this discount, pub landlords must buy beer and other supplies from the company that owns their establishment. This is the ""wet rent"". Landlords pay a much higher rate for this ""wet rent"" than they would if they bought their supplies on the open market. Tied licensees are paying up to 77% more for Fosters, 67% more for San Miguel and 55% more for Heineken, according to research from voluntary consumer organisation The Campaign for Real Ale (Camra). Pub trade body BBPA says the tied arrangement enables an individual to run their own pub for a relatively small start up cost of around £20,000 compared with the £250,000 required to set up independently. And pub companies such as Enterprise and Punch Taverns, which between them own 9,000 tenanted pubs, argue this is the only way for many pubs to get off the ground in the first place. Nonetheless, tied licensees are around £13,000 a year worse off than their untied rivals, according to Camra, with 60% earning less than the national minimum wage equivalent salary of £10,000 a year. And the government's own research suggests that half of the ""tied pub"" licensees in the UK earn less than £15,000 a year, which is indicated as the minimum starting salary for an employed licensee by the Government's National Careers Service. How did this vote come about? Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland, who proposed the reform, said it would ""simply bring back market forces into a sector that frankly has become grotesquely anti-competitive"". He argues that the 400-year old tie system has been abused by the pub companies and that the basic deal - that a tied-pub tenant pays a lower rent to compensate for the higher beer price they pay - is no longer the case. Mr Mulholland claims that the average tied rent is now higher than the rent paid by non-tied tenants meaning, he says, that tied tenants are ""being overcharged twice"". The new rules mean that a tied tenant of a large pub company, one which owns more than 500 pubs, would be able to have the amount of rent they pay independently assessed. This would happen when a rent review is due, or if there was a sudden change in circumstances, such as a rival pub opening nearby offering cheaper prices. If they choose, the tied tenant could then instead choose a rent only agreement. When did the pub companies become so powerful? It was largely thanks to the so called Beer Orders, introduced in 1989. The orders decreed no brewer could own more than 2,000 pubs and was aimed at enabling small brewers to survive in a market then dominated by six large national firms: Allied, Bass, Courage, Grand Metropolitan, Scottish & Newcastle and Whitbread. However, the brewers, reluctant to open up their pubs to rival brewers' beers, instead created pub companies to which they sold their pubs. These pub companies were exempt from the Beer Orders legislation and as a result were able to own more pubs than the 2,000 originally decreed. Will my pint be cheaper? Hold your horses. This isn't actually law yet. The amendment to the bill still has to be voted through the House of Lords before it becomes law. Even Mr Mulholland, who put forward the amendment, has said in the short term it should be ""business as usual"" for pubs. But if the change does become law, the jury's still out on the impact. Campaigners backing the change have said if pubs pay less for their beer and rent then ultimately they will be able to charge their customers less: ""Allowing over 13,000 pub tenants tied to the large pub companies the option of buying beer on the open market at competitive prices will help keep pubs open and ensure the cost of a pint to consumers remains affordable,"" says Tim Page, Camra's chief executive. But analysts say it's quite possible the opposite will be the case: pub owners will find it hard to manage the costs of paying market-rate rents and as a result more pubs will close and there will be even less competition on prices. ""Whilst the larger managed units will be unaffected, life could become more difficult towards the bottom end of the market with a larger number of units deemed uneconomic by their current owners,"" said Langton Capital analyst Mark Brumby. Mr Brumby warns that ultimately these pubs could end up being turned into convenience stores or residential homes.","Monday's vote ending the beer tie has been called ""historic"" by campaigners which have said it will help ""secure the future of the Great British pub""."
"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst It has lost its previous triple-A rating from the World Energy Council (WEC) - a global body representing the energy sector. The authors of the WEC report said a vacuum in energy policy since the election was deterring investors needed to create new electricity supplies. But the government said it was still a world leader in energy policy. It said it was committed to securing energy supplies through nuclear and shale gas. The criticism from the WEC follows a complaint from the UN's chief environment scientist that the UK was turning away from renewables, just as they were being embraced by the rest of the world in the run-up to Paris climate talks this month. The WEC report ranks countries on their policies to keep the lights on, bills and carbon emissions down. It says the UK has been a leader in these policies. But its says the government's drastic withdrawal of subsidies for wind and solar power has deterred investors needed for new energy supplies. UK ranking under threat Electricity has become comparatively more expensive, and the UK remains on a ""watch-list"" over how it will secure its future energy supply. The report warned the UK faced the run-down of nuclear plants and the closure of coal-powered stations, alongside ageing infrastructure - meaning its ranking is set to fall in future assessments. It urged the government to ensure consistent policy to secure and maintain investments while reforms to the energy system are being implemented. Britain still gets an AAB rating from the council and is still in the world's top four. But that may be a let-off, because the report was written before damaging revelations in a leaked letter that the government has misled people over its progress on EU renewable energy targets. The government denies misleading Parliament to believe that it will hit its mandatory 15% renewable energy target in 2020. But the letter makes clear that the shortfall of approaching 25% in renewables has been hidden from the public - and over several summer months in which subsidies were being cut, journalists were consistently told that the EU renewables targets were still being met. Energy Secretary Amber Rudd told MPs the government remained committed to the targets, which will be achieved by greater focus on renewable heat and transport, rather than electricity. She added: ""I recognise, as that letter does, that we don't have the right policies, particularly in transport and heat in order to make those 2020 targets, but we have four to five years and I remain committed to making those targets."" A spokesman for her department, commenting on the WEC report, said: ""We've made record investments in renewables and are committed to lower-carbon secure energy, such as nuclear and shale gas, which will help keep the lights on for future generations."" Energy analysts are baffled as to why the government is blocking onshore wind and large-scale solar power, as these are among the cheapest options for hitting the renewables target. The UN praises the UK for its international role on climate, especially in helping developing countries get clean energy supplies like wind and solar. But the head of the climate negotiations said she noted concern among international allies over recent UK policy changes.

"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter From inception, it was not just a massive piece of government support spending, but, as importantly, a piece of mass applied psychology. The ""furlough"" scheme was designed to get into the heads of employers and persuade them to hold off on firing workers from businesses suffering in the pandemic shutdowns. To park them, to put them on ""standby mode"" as one cabinet minister put it to me, so they could be switched back on to contribute to a V-shaped bounce back recovery when the pandemic peak passed. Universal Credit claims surge That has worked. Universal Credit applications have gone up by 1.8 million, but without the furlough scheme it would have been multiples of that. Crucially, it has kept workers contractually connected to their workplaces. This helps avoid what economists call ""hysteresis"" - the scarring effect of unemployment on the economy and public finances over many years. Some 6.3 million jobs are currently being paid for by government, approaching one in four of total UK employments. But at £8bn so far, it is possible that the expert forecasts of a total cost of £39bn by July, is reached, which does put the cost of the scheme per month at the same order as monthly NHS funding. So while the government says the spending has been good value for money, it is also, in the chancellor's words not sustainable. 'No cliff edge' This has led to a suggestion that support will be pulled, and the Treasury clarifying that there will be no ""cliff edge"". The Treasury did not say that people were ""addicted"" to the funding - it has only just started to be paid out. But their dilemma is that they do want to give a broad signal that employers should not become dependent on the scheme - they should expect to get their workforces back working and earning, as safe social distancing arrangements are agreed. At the same time they want to reassure that the scheme will be fully available until the end of June, and then will be eased out, in some form. More flexibility? All options are being discussed on how to phase it out. The amount could be reduced from 80%. Its sectoral application could mirror the phasing in of the reopening of sectors of the economy. Perhaps the most interesting idea is to learn from the Irish and the Germans on applying the scheme more flexibly, and allowing hours rather than jobs to be furloughed, instantly removing the necessity for employers to require that employees do not work. This is being pushed by some business groups, and the opposition Labour Party too. Some Conservative thinkers have even suggested privately, as is the case in Germany, that a scheme such as this, could be made semi-permanent. The Kurzarbeit system, which is a century-old is credited with saving a million jobs a decade ago, and is paid at 60% of wages, but is untaxed and applies to hours lost rather than requiring a worker to stop employment. Such a scheme would basically be an expensive form of employment insurance, operating through the private sector rather than the Department for Work and Pensions. This is not in the Treasury's plans, as they seek to reaffirm the support is temporary. But the behavioural economics of withdrawing support in any form is very delicate. It was the aviation industry who last week asked for the scheme to be extended into and past July. The loss of thousands of jobs in that sector followed clarification that such a move should not be relied on, for an industry facing a fundamental long-lasting change in trading conditions. The aviation industry is now saying even after those losses that the scheme needs to be extended until October. But the message has gone out, in vague terms not to get too reliant on this extraordinary form of funding. But if the impression emerged that the scheme was to be wrapped up too quickly, as one business group leader told me, it would lead to hundreds of thousands of instant job losses. Many options are being discussed. No decisions have been taken yet. But clarity will be needed quickly.",The chancellor has the most delicate of balancing acts over the eventual withdrawal of the Job Retention Scheme.
"The revised takeover bid made at the end of December was for 2.40 euros (£1.88) per share. The Irish carrier had rebuffed an earlier approach from IAG earlier in the month worth 2.30 euros a share, saying it undervalued the business. By acquiring Aer Lingus, IAG would have gained more take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, its home base, allowing it to operate more flights. But an acquisition of Aer Lingus would require the backing of the budget carrier, Ryanair which owns 29.9% of the company, and has itself tried and failed to take it over. The Irish government owns 25% of Aer Lingus and would also have had to agree the deal.",Aer Lingus has rejected a renewed offer from British Airways owner IAG.
"The BRC Neilsen Shop Price Index showed food prices fell 1.1% in August, following 0.8% falls in the previous two months. Competition among supermarkets is driving deflation. However the BRC warned that a weakened pound is likely to push up grocery prices in the coming months. The pound has fallen in value since the UK voted in June to leave the European Union, which makes imported goods more expensive. Falling prices ""Lower prices this August compared to last were driven by a combination of continuing promotional activity, softening oil prices and a global supply glut of wheat weighing on food prices,"" said Helen Dickinson, BRC chief executive. The index showed that overall shop prices reported deflation of 2% in August, compared to a 1.6% decline in July. Non-food deflation rose to 2.5% in August from 2.2% in July. Morrisons is the latest to announce price cuts on food, reducing the cost of 130 essential meat and poultry products by 12%. The supermarket chain said it has cut the prices of more than 4,435 products this year. 'Upward pressure' ""The devaluation of sterling in the wake of the referendum will put upward pressure on shop prices,"" warned Ms Dickinson. But she added that price increases are several months away ""given that retailers won't feel the brunt of the cost increases until existing contracts with foreign suppliers come to an end"". Even then supermarket competition may help keep rises to a minimum. ""Retailers will have to make a decision about when and how much to pass onto consumers,"" Ms Dickinson pointed out. ""Given the strength of competition in the market, and if the economy softens in line with predictions, any pass through may be more limited than implied by the exchange rate movement.""","The cost of food fell by a record amount last month, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC)."
"By Jamie RobertsonPresenter, BBC World News The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is already putting together a plan for tackling the most aggressive tax schemes. CBI boss John Cridland said action by the UK outside that process would ""be a concern for global businesses"". Mr Osborne claims his crackdown will raise £1bn from multinationals. Tax campaigners say tax reform to prevent international companies from paying low tax is hard, but possible. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: ""International tax rules are in urgent need of updating, but the decision for the UK to go it alone, outside the OECD process, will be a concern for global businesses, and moving the goalposts on offsetting losses risks creating a worrying precedent."" Mr Osborne's proposal has been called the ""Google tax"", but Google is certainly not the only large company accused of using the magic of international accounting to shift profits around the globe. The allegation is that the bulk of those profits often end up in low-tax regimes, even if an unsophisticated observer can't see how they were earned there. Apple, Amazon, Starbucks and several others could have the UK tax collector's hounds on their trail - if the chancellor's plans work. These companies are doing nothing that is illegal. It was avoiding tax, not evading it, that Mr Osborne tackled in the Autumn Statement. The problem A recent Financial Times analysis of seven US technology giants found they paid just £54m in UK corporate tax in 2012, even though their overall sales to British customers totalled $15bn. The problem is no-one really knows what Mr Osborne's solution is. One thing is for sure - he did little on Wednesday to explain how a Diverted Profits Tax worked. This is what he did say: ""Today I am introducing a 25% tax on profits generated by multinationals from economic activity here in the UK which they then artificially shift out of the country."" ""This new Diverted Profits Tax will raise over £1bn over the next five years."" And that was about it. So, what could the government do to bring in the £1bn that it is looking for? Ahead of the curve The UK is already no slouch when it comes to talking tough on tax avoiders. The OECD is developing an Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting or BEPS (what you and I would call aggressive tax avoidance) and the chancellor never wastes an opportunity to voice his support for it. But the action plan still has a way to go and won't be completed for another year. Mr Osborne is ahead of the curve. That's not necessarily a good thing, say some observers. Kevin Hindley, managing director at professional services group Alvarez & Marsal Taxand, said: ""We thought the government would do something like this, as part of implementing the OECD proposals, but not so soon. ""It really is superseding what is happening internationally and it is a bit of a surprise that it's happening without consultation or discussion with business."" Then again, Mr Osborne has an election to fight in May 2015, so he may not want to wait for all the other members of the OECD to catch up. Country by country One thing that is likely to be crucial to his new tax is another OECD initiative: ""country by country"" reporting. When you read most multinationals' reports you will find profits pulled together into global or regional areas. ""Country by country"" reporting would force them to break down their results for each country. The UK was the first of the 44 countries involved in the proposals to formally commit to this new regime. So tax jurisdictions will now get a chance to see exactly where profits are coming from. That raises great opportunities to claw back tax - but problems too. One of the opportunities is outlined by economist and tax campaigner Richard Murphy. He calls it Unitary Apportionment Taxation. In effect it would mean using ""country by country"" reporting to work out where sales were made and then dividing the taxable profits accordingly. So if 10% of sales from a multinational came from the UK, HMRC would be entitled to tax 10% of the profits. Sales But even Mr Murphy concedes that he would be ""amazed"" if it happened: ""The OECD has already ruled this out as an option. But it would be a revolution in taxation - and in global taxation - if George Osborne goes down this route. ""If he did it, it would also mean an enormous row with the US. American companies would go ballistic over it."" Mr Hindley explains that sales are not necessarily a good way to apportion tax. He said: ""If one company had large sales of low-margin, low-profit, goods to one jurisdiction, they could end up being taxed more than a company that say, had low sales but high-margin profits coming from the same country."" This is the argument used by Starbucks who claim that, despite its large sales to the UK, ""we have found making a profit in the UK difficult and therefore have not been in a position to pay much corporation tax"". Mr Hindley said there were other methods to impose a Diverted Profits Tax, such as through withholding taxes - a tax deducted from an internal payment - or by denying companies the ability to deduct tax when paying royalties to other parts of their organisations. But he added that it was impossible to know how such rules would interact with existing double taxation agreements and regulations over transfer pricing (that is the pricing of goods between different parts of a company) and he said that ""speculation will be rife over the coming weeks"".","The Confederation of British Industry has warned over Chancellor George Osborne's plans for the UK to ""go it alone"" on corporate tax reform."
"UK GDP was 3.2% higher in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Revised ONS figures also show the UK economy surpassed its pre-recession peak in the third quarter of 2013. Previously, this was thought to have been achieved in the second quarter of 2014. The figures from the ONS include a new methodology for calculating gross domestic product (GDP). The new measure includes factors such as spending on research and development, as well as the economic contribution made by drug dealers and prostitutes. The ONS now estimates that GDP was 2.7% higher than its pre-crisis peak by the end of the second quarter this year. However, the ONS also revised its estimate of growth in the first quarter of the year down to 0.7% from an earlier estimate of 0.8%. Business investment Growth in the second quarter of the year was boosted by a 1.1% rise in output from the services industry. The contribution from construction was revised up sharply to show 0.7% growth compared with a previous estimate of zero growth. The Bank of England forecasts that the UK's economy will grow by 3.5% in 2014, and the ONS figures show the business confidence is continuing to strengthen. Business investment grew 11% in the second quarter compared with the same period last year. But despite economic growth, the current account deficit - a measure of how much a country's imports exceed the value of its exports - widened from 4.7% of GDP in the first quarter of 2014 to 5.2% in the second quarter. David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the deficit was at ""a level which in the long-term will prove to be unsustainable"". And under the ONS's new methodology, public sector debt as a percentage of GDP, excluding banks, now stands at 79.1% compared with 76.5% using the old system. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ""While a smaller than previously reported recession in 2008-09 and better than previously reported GDP growth since then is welcome news, it does not hugely change the growth outlook - especially as there have been no major revisions to the economy's performance in 2013 and the first half of 2014. ""What it does imply though is that the UK's recent productivity performance has not been as bad as thought and that the economy has greater capacity to grow without generating inflationary pressures."" Analysis: Anthony Reuben, BBC Head of Statistics There have been big changes to the way UK economic growth is measured since we had our last update from the ONS. In addition to the headline-grabbing stuff about including the proceeds of illegal drugs and prostitution - estimated to add £10bn a year to the UK economy - we've also had changes to the treatment of weapons, research and development spending and services provided by non-profit institutions such as charities. These changes have added billions of pounds to the total amount produced by the economy. But because there have been revisions to the measures going back to the 1970s, the amount of growth from quarter to quarter has not changed a great deal. We've seen changes of 0.1 percentage points here and there, which is well within the margin of error for these figures.","UK economic growth has been revised up to 0.9% for the second quarter of the year by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), compared with a previous estimate of 0.8%."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set a deadline of 29 August 2019 for the final PPI claims to be made. So far, £31.9bn has been paid out in compensation, with major banks having set aside another £10bn or so for future claims. As many as 64 million PPI policies were sold from as long ago as the 1970s. The policies were designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job. Not all of them were mis-sold, but sales were pushed on a huge scale to people who didn't want or need them or who could not use them. The FCA has been running an advertising campaign, including a demand from the animatronic head of Arnold Schwarzenegger to ""do it now"", to encourage people to make a claims for compensation if they were mis-sold PPI. The approaching deadline will prompt more calls from the claims management companies touting for business through calls and texts. They take a cut of any payouts made to claimants who use their services, even though people can make a claim themselves for free. How to make a claim More information on PPI and how you can claim is available on the FCA website. A free phone line, managed by the FCA, can be called on 0800 101 8800. Various templates are also available to download, along with guidance on claiming, on websites such as Which?, MoneySavingExpert, and Resolver. Claims management companies, consumer groups and the regulator are also raising awareness of a Supreme Court case, known as the Plevin case, which means 2.4 million rejected compensation claimants may now be able to make a fresh appeal. The ruling dealt with the case of a financial company's client not being made aware of a commission being paid when they were sold PPI. The court agreed that the company's failure to tell its client that it was receiving a large commission for the sale was unfair. The FCA has ruled that banks should have declared the commission if it was over 50%. If they did not declare it, then the customer is entitled to the return of any commission over 50%, plus interest, even if the PPI was not mis-sold. This has added extra funds set aside by banks for settling claims. Banks wanted a earlier deadline for PPI claims and are keen to draw a line under the saga.",Loan customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) have exactly a year left to make a claim for compensation.
"Super Mario Run will be released in Apple's App Store on 15 December, with users having to pay $10 (£8) for the full game. Nintendo, which announced the tie-up last month, saw its shares jump by as much as 5%. It hopes to build on the global success of its Pokemon Go app from earlier this year. But because Pokemon was free to download, analysts said it did not generate as much money for the firm as it could have done. Nintendo plans to move Super Mario into movies When Japan's PM appeared as Mario Smartphones are the gaming industry's fastest growing source of revenue and the Japanese firm has been criticised for being slow on the uptake. It has promised to to unveil more gaming titles by March 2017, with an Android version of Super Mario Run also planned. The evolution of Super Mario",Shares in Nintendo have climbed after it announced a launch date for its new Super Mario game for the iPhone.
"Under the plan, Chinese nationals visiting the EU will not need to submit separate UK visa applications if they book with selected travel agents. Mr Osborne is trying to persuade more Chinese companies to invest in the UK. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that his trip was also about changing British attitudes to China. ""Many people think of China as a sweat shop on the Pearl River. Yet it is at the forefront of medicine, computing and technology. It's a very rapidly changing country."" Earlier, Mr Osborne told an audience of students that his visit was about ""much more than a collection of business deals"". ""What I really want it to be about is strengthening the understanding between our two nations, deepening our friendship, working out where by working together we can improve the lives of all our citizens,"" he said in a speech to university students in Beijing. ""Yes, of course, we have differences, different political systems, we attach value to different things, and we shouldn't be afraid of pointing out where we disagree. ""But let us not do it in a way that is not respectful of each other and tries to understand each other, and let us try to overcome our differences and work together in peaceful co-operation. ""Because ultimately we want the same thing - a better life for our citizens."" Adam Marshall, director of policy at business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce, said UK businesses would ""breathe a collective sigh of relief"" at the plans to simplify Chinese visa applications. ""For too long, Britain has courted Chinese investment and tourism without facilitating the entry of Chinese visitors with the same vigour. A responsive visa system is crucial to demonstrating that the UK is open to trade and investment,"" he added. Mobile visa scheme During his week-long trip, Mr Osborne has already unveiled a deal in which a Chinese firm took a 20% stake in a new business park in Manchester. And on Sunday came details of the visa changes. Currently, Chinese visitors can apply for a single visa to visit much of Europe but a separate one is required to travel to the UK. It is thought that the extra paperwork is deterring many Chinese visitors from including the UK in a trip to Europe. A mobile visa scheme that already operates in Beijing and Shanghai will be expanded as part of the changes. Under the mobile service, which was first tested by executives at Wanda, the company that bought Sunseeker yachts, officials go out to applicants to collect their paperwork and biometric data. The process can take less than five minutes. A 24-hour ""super priority"" visa service will also be available from next summer. The moves will be welcomed by UK businesses who want to benefit from Chinese tourists. In his speech, Mr Osborne said: ""Let me make this clear to you and to the whole of China, there is no limit to the number of Chinese who could study in Britain. ""There is no limit to the number of Chinese tourists who can visit. No limit on the amount of business we can do together."" According to the government, last year 210,000 visas were issued to Chinese nationals and they contributed about £300m to the UK economy.","Visa applications for Chinese visitors entering the UK will be simplified, Chancellor George Osborne has announced during his trade trip to China."
"By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News Is he right? BBC legal affairs correspondent Clive Coleman has the answers. What exactly is parliamentary sovereignty? It means Parliament is the big dog. It can lumber around the constitution passing any law it likes. None of the smaller dogs can challenge the big fella. Or, if you want a less canine definition, Parliament's own website defines it as ""a principle of the UK constitution. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK, which can create or end any law. Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution"". Like I said, the big dog. OK - but did we lose parliamentary sovereignty in 1972? Yes, some of it. The big dog agreed to give up some kennel space. Or if you want that in a less doggy way, in 1972 the UK Parliament passed the European Communities Act. It gave direct effect to EU law and meant that if there was a conflict between an act of the British Parliament and EU law, Parliament lost out and EU law prevailed. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) became a kind of Supreme Court of Europe, interpreting EU law with judgements that were binding on all member states. Rhodri Thompson QC, a specialist in EU law, puts it this way: ""The basic relationship between UK and EU law has been clear since 1972 - Parliament remains sovereign but recognises the binding nature of EU law. The only other mechanism, used by some other member states, is to entrust ultimate national sovereignty to their constitutional courts as guardians of a written constitution."" Germany and its constitutional court is the example often cited, giving the impression it has a muscular German shepherd guarding its constitutional independence, in comparison with the weaker British spaniel. However, that is not the case. Germany does not have parliamentary sovereignty. If the UK moved to a model based upon a written constitution guaranteed by a constitutional court, it would be passing sovereignty to a group of unelected judges and taking it away from Parliament. No-one, including the prime minister, seems to think such a seismic constitutional shift is a good idea. Right, so does that mean part of our parliamentary sovereignty has gone forever? Down, Fido! Absolutely not. Parliament could repeal the 1972 Act and take back the part of its sovereignty that was lost to EU law. What Parliament gives, Parliament can take back. On its website, Parliament says: ""Over the years, Parliament has passed laws that limit the application of parliamentary sovereignty. These laws reflect political developments both within and outside the UK. They include the UK's entry to the European Union in 1973. ""These developments do not fundamentally undermine the principle of parliamentary sovereignty, since, in theory at least, Parliament could repeal any of the laws implementing these changes."" Come on, isn't there some way to beef up the sovereignty of our Parliament short of repealing the 1972 European Communities Act? Can we make the big British bulldog bark a bit louder at the EU? Isn't that what the prime minister meant when he told the BBC's Andrew Marr on 21 February: ""We're going to set out in the coming days proposals… to make clear that… the British Parliament is sovereign. We have chosen to join the EU, we could choose to leave the EU, and I think there's some important work to put that point beyond doubt."" Is there some additional power - bark and bite if you like - that can be given to Parliament that rebalances the power relationship between it and the EU? Not according to the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. He told Andrew Marr on 6 March: ""A huge intellectual effort went into creating this language by which we could somehow ensure that... our courts, our Supreme Court, our House of Commons, could overturn judgements of the European Court of Justice if we felt, if Britain felt, that they were in some way capricious or if they were going beyond the Treaty."" But he added that the government lawyers ""just blew up. And they, you know, they said this basically voids our obligations under the 1972 European Communities Act, it doesn't work, we can't - and that is, I'm afraid, the reality. You cannot express the sovereignty of Parliament and accept the 1972 European Communities Act. There's no way of doing both at the same time."" There it is, that's the view of the big Labrador of British politics (that's Boris Johnson) of the way the big parliamentary dog is currently kennelled. Yes, I am persisting with this canine imagery. Is he right? No. Parliamentary sovereignty has never gone away or lost its ""expression"", because Parliament can scrap the 1972 Act. But, says Prof Takis Tridimas, chair of European law at King's College London, creating entirely new rules for the UK to ignore or sidestep EU law is not really a runner. ""What is not on offer is selective compliance with EU law, i.e. a situation where Parliament picks and chooses which provisions of EU law to follow and which not to follow on a case-by-case basis. This is not on offer under any international agreement."" In other words, the big dog can't be a member of the club and play by a different set of rules from all the other dogs. It has to obey the rules or leave the club. If the UK votes to stay in the EU it will have to let sleeping dogs lie, in the sense that it will have to continue to accept the primacy of EU law. If it votes to leave, the big dog is back in charge.

"The remarks were the latest effort by L Brands boss Les Wexner to distance himself from Mr Epstein, who died in prison while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges in August. Mr Wexner employed Mr Epstein as a close adviser, but cut ties in 2007. He has previously accused Mr Epstein of misappropriating money. ""Being taken advantage of by someone who is... so depraved is something I'm embarrassed I'm even close to,"" Mr Wexner said at his company's annual investor day. The backlash over Mr Wexner's long friendship with Mr Epstein has added pressure on the billionaire, whose leadership was already under scrutiny due to falling sales at Victoria's Secret. L Brands, which owns Victoria's Secret and beauty chain Bath & Body Works, in July said it would review Mr Epstein's connections to the company. On Tuesday, Mr Wexner described Mr Epstein's alleged behaviour as ""inexplicable"" and ""abhorrent"". ""In the present, everyone has to feel enormous regret for the advantage that was taken of so many young women,"" he said. ""At some point in your life, we are all betrayed by friends, and if we haven't, we're really fortunate to have lived a perfectly sheltered life,"" he added. Plea deal Mr Epstein, who worked as a teacher before moving into finance, once boasted a high-flying social circle that included Prince Andrew, former US President Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, among others. He died in prison in August, awaiting trial on charges that he paid girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. He had avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. Outcry over that plea deal led US Labor Secretary Alex Acosta - who had overseen the deal as a former prosecutor - to resign this summer. The head of the MIT Media Lab also recently resigned following revelations about the academic centre's ties to Mr Epstein.","The head of Victoria's Secret has told investors he is ""embarrassed"" by his long friendship with the late US financier Jeffrey Epstein."
"By David QuinnBBC Watchdog Live The man, who was then 19, was found unconscious in a London park by a dog walker after being attacked and robbed. When he came round in hospital 12 hours later, thieves had spent about £20,000 on his stolen debit card, but NatWest refused to refund him. After BBC Watchdog Live investigated, the bank reversed its decision. It also apologised for a ""lack of clarity"" in its original ruling. The customer, Arthur, has requested his surname is not made public to protect his privacy. He told the programme's presenter, Steph McGovern: ""It's destroyed my life. It's made me feel like I am the criminal and I feel I have been accused of fraud. ""I ended up in hospital. I could very easily have died that night - why would I put myself through that?"" The money stolen was part of an inheritance that had been deposited into his NatWest account earlier in 2017. Arthur protested his innocence for a year as the bank continued to refuse his fraud claim. The programme's investigation found that NatWest provided no evidence to show Arthur was grossly negligent, as is required under Payment Services Regulations when fraud claims are turned down. Arun Chauhan, a lawyer and member of the Fraud Advisory Panel, said the rules were clear and Arthur should always have been refunded the amount lost. He told the programme: ""It's not for Arthur to prove his innocence - it's for the banks to prove Arthur is in the wrong. ""They accept he's been assaulted and they accept the transactions were by a third party, so unless they can prove gross negligence, or fraud on Arthur's behalf, he needs to be compensated."" Arthur says he has few memories of the attack, but guesses the perpetrators may have spied on him to obtain his Pin number prior to the robbery and opened his phone using his fingerprint while he was knocked out. An ambulance report confirms he was found lying unconscious in a park with blood on his face at about 09:30 on the day of the attack, and was taken to hospital. His bank statements show multiple purchases on the stolen debit card at stores across the capital that day, including £8,300 in a single transaction at a designer clothing store. An initial decision letter from NatWest in December 2017 stated Arthur's claim for a refund was turned down ""in line with our policy"" and gave notice it would be closing his account. The bank subsequently told Arthur there were ""inconsistencies"" in his testimony, but did not disclose specific details. 'Complex' NatWest reversed its decision this week, after being contacted by Watchdog. In a statement, NatWest's parent company RBS said: ""We would like to offer our apologies to Arthur for the distress that he has experienced as a result of the attack on him and the subsequent events that followed. ""We treat all claims of fraud with the utmost seriousness and investigate them on a case-by-case basis to ensure a fair outcome for the customer. ""The case raised by Arthur was a complex one and there existed a number of inconsistencies between the version of events presented to us by him and following our own internal investigation. ""Following a further review of the case, we have taken the decision to refund Arthur in full and would like to apologise for any lack of clarity presented to him regarding our initial decision."" The Financial Ombudsman Service, which resolves financial services complaints, told banks earlier this year to stop ""automatically"" blaming their customers for fraud. Last month, Watchdog featured the case of Charlotte Higman, who was blamed by RBS for a £4,300 telephone banking scam, which was refunded after the programme's investigation showed fraudsters answered security questions wrongly. Bank accounts are the most targeted product for fraudsters, with 100,000 cases recorded last year. You can watch Watchdog Live's full report on BBC One on Wednesday 5 December at 20:00 GMT, and afterwards on iPlayer.","A NatWest customer who was defrauded of £20,000 while he was in hospital following a violent mugging in December 2017 has been refunded by the bank."
"Mr Nunn has been announced as the new replacement for Antonio Horta-Osorio, who leaves the bank in the summer. He will be paid about a fifth less than the outgoing boss. The £5.5m figure is the maximum he could receive in annual pay. The sum includes a £1.13m salary, a fixed bonus of £1.05m and longer-term bonuses and pension payments. Top banker salaries in the UK have been dropping in recent years amid sluggish share price performance, low profitability and shareholder unease. Mr Nunn will also be bought out of various bonuses he was expected to be paid at HSBC, where he led the bank's High Street banking division. The bank didn't disclose an amount. Mr Horta-Osorio was paid £4.73m last year - down on the £6.54m a year earlier. Mr Nunn's maximum £5.5m payout compares with a potential £4.26m award for NatWest boss Alison Rose, £8.3m for Jes Staley at Barclays and £9.9m for HSBC chief Noel Quinn. In each case, the total is based on demanding targets, and the final payout is likely to be lower. Insiders at Barclays and HSBC insist that their companies are more complex businesses, taking in investment banking and operations abroad. But such large payouts still attract criticism. ""Changes in key staff are an absolutely critical test of whether banks are serious about changing the culture of vast internal pay gaps between a handful of senior bankers at the top and the branch staff, cleaners, caterers, security workers and administrators who ensure the organisation can function,"" said Luke Hildyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre think tank. ""This is a real failure of that test. It really shouldn't require a £6m pay package to attract someone to the job."" A start date has yet to be agreed with HSBC, which could mean finance chief William Chalmers has to lead the bank after Mr Horta-Osorio leaves and before Mr Nunn arrives. Remote working Last month, Lloyds asked staff currently working from home as a result of the coronavirus pandemic to continue doing so until at least next spring. The group said the decision was ""in line with guidance"". At present, the UK government recommends people work from home to limit the spread of Covid-19. Lloyds has 65,000 staff, the majority of whom are presently working remotely. In September, the bank said it was cutting 865 jobs in areas such as insurance and wealth management as it revived plans to restructure the business.",Lloyds Banking Group's new boss Charlie Nunn could be awarded £5.5m in annual pay and bonuses if he hits his targets.
"It comes after the pandemic has strained many producers and forced the US to scramble for medical gear. The initial review is focused on computer chips, pharmaceuticals, rare earth minerals and large batteries, such as those used in electric cars. China is a key supplier for many of those items. US officials said the review was not targeted at China, which like the US imports most of its computer chips and has been trying to boost domestic production. They said the administration was interested in increasing some production in the US and expected to work with other countries for items that could not be made domestically. Reliance on ""strategic competitor nations"" is expected to be part of the analysis, they added. ""While we cannot predict what crisis will hit us, we should have the capacity to respond quickly in the face of challenges,"" the White House said in a statement announcing the study, which will start with a 100-day focused review, before widening its scope. ""The United States must ensure that production shortages, trade disruptions, natural disasters and potential actions by foreign competitors and adversaries never leave the United States vulnerable again."" Under pressure The president, who will formally sign the executive order on Wednesday, has come under pressure as firms such as General Motors and Ford have cut production and announced lay-offs due to the shortage of chips - key components for many electronic products, which have been in high demand due to the pandemic. Republicans have also pushed Mr Biden to do more to address reliance on China, while business and technology lobby groups have also called on the administration to introduce investment tax credits to encourage the building of more US semiconductor manufacturing plants, where the chips are produced. ""While the governments of our global competitors have invested heavily to attract new semiconductor manufacturing and research facilities, the absence of US incentives has made our country uncompetitive and America's share of global semiconductor manufacturing has steadily declined,"" the groups wrote in a recent letter, signed by the US Chamber of Commerce, the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, among others. ""To be competitive and strengthen the resilience of critical supply chains, we believe the US needs to incentivize the construction of new and modernized semiconductor manufacturing facilities and invest in research capabilities."" US semiconductor firms currently account for 47% of global chip sales, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. However, just 12% of chips are made in the US, down from 37% in 1990. Under former President Donald Trump, the US adopted a protectionist approach, increasing border taxes and in some cases forbidding US firms from doing business with Chinese competitors in an effort to boost US producers. Amid the changes, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, last May announced plans to build a $12bn (£8.5bn) factory in the US.",US President Joe Biden has ordered officials to find ways to bolster supply chains as a shortage of computer chips hits carmakers around the world.
"Simon JackBusiness editor After intervention from the Chinese ambassador, it is also now the litmus test for Anglo-China relations under the new regime at Number 10. After EDF's board narrowly agreed to press ahead with the project, the UK government surprised company officials by saying it needed several weeks to consider before signing. The decision to delay is widely thought to have come from Theresa May herself, influenced by Joint Chief of Staff and outspoken critic of China's creeping influence, Nick Timothy. Prestige Without China's involvement, this project would not have received EDF board approval. It was seen as a risk sharing mechanism for the French, a prestige project for China and the ushering in of ever-closer Chinese relations. Nevertheless, and perhaps understandably, the prime minister wanted time to think. Well, today's warning from the Chinese ambassador that the relationship between the two countries is at risk has given her plenty to think about. Writing in the Financial Times, Liu Xiaoming made clear that the stakes here are high by linking government approval for Hinkley Point to the future of the relationship which is he said a ""crucial historical juncture"". Golden era No kidding. In a post Brexit world, Britain needs all the friends it can get and much was made of the importance of forging close trade links with non-EU nations. There may be legitimate security concerns over having sensitive infrastructure assets under Chinese management but a decision to back out will clearly take the shine off the ""golden era"" of collaboration between the two countries, proclaimed during Xi Jinping's state visit last year. Theresa May is not the only one who wants to take her time. The French Journal du Dimanche quoted an unnamed EDF manager pointing out the benefits of hitting the pause button. If construction was delayed until 2019 when a similar reactor will be up and running (fingers crossed) at Flamanville in France, the cost of financing the project would fall dramatically. With a working example, EDF could secure cheaper loans with government guarantees rather than self finance through costly equity. That would reduce the threat to EDF's finances, appease the French unions and lower the guaranteed price of the electricity produced from £92.50 to £75 per megawatt hour - a big saving for UK taxpayers. It would however delay the project another three years at a time when infrastructure spending is seen as crucial to create jobs, stimulate the economy and keep the lights on. Plenty to keep the PM's mind occupied when she heads off for her summer holidays.",Hinkley Point is the world's most expensive nuclear project.
"By James MelikReporter, Business Daily, BBC World Service However, it reawakens the debate about whether banned drugs should go on sale legally. Not only could such a move potentially open up a huge commercial market, but it could also become a source of tax revenue. But it is an extremely controversial issue and even in the Netherlands, which led the way with its cannabis cafes, the policy is now being questioned. Second thoughts In the Netherlands, marijuana is not formally legal, but it can be sold in small quantities in licensed coffee shops. In one such coffee shop, on a houseboat on the river Maas in the southern Dutch town of Maastricht, Stephan explains there are about 5,000 varieties of marijuana, or cannabis, in the world. ""We sell white rhino, silver haze, amnesia, lemon haze. We sell blue cheese and yeah, it makes you more stoned. It makes you a little bit sleepy,"" he says. However, new laws in the south of the country prevent foreign tourists from visiting the coffee shops. Stephan says that in the six months since the law was introduced, his sales are down by 85%. Marc Josemans, the president of the Maastricht association of coffee shop entrepreneurs, is leading a campaign to overturn the ban on foreigners in coffee shops. ""Here in the south, we have committed a form of tourism suicide,"" he says. ""People are avoiding Maastricht because our own mayor calls our foreign visitors scum. ""Our mayor should not start kicking the guests who want to visit our beautiful town. We should be grateful that these people want to spend their money here,"" he says. ""You can never win a war against drugs, you can only control it by being realistic and pragmatic,"" he adds. Mr Josemans has one question for the critics of licensed coffee shops. ""If your 18- or 19-year-old son or daughter wants to experiment by smoking a joint, would you prefer that they visit a street dealer where nobody gives any information?"" he asks. ""Or do you want them to visit a controlled environment, where information and maybe even prevention is available. If, for example, they want to light up a second joint in 10 minutes, somebody from the staff will come up and say, 'Hey, isn't it better to slow down,'"" he adds. Conflict of interest The results in Colorado and Washington, which already have laws legalising marijuana for medical purposes, put both states in conflict with the US federal government, which classifies cannabis as an illegal narcotic. However, it might also create a tax bonanza from the income generated. But do the economic benefits through taxation of drug sales make sense? And furthermore, if the Netherlands starts backtracking on drug liberalisation, how does that bode for the rest of the world? Jeff Miron, at Harvard University in the US, argues that the Dutch stance is disappointing. ""The Netherlands has been at the forefront of liberalising drug policy,"" he says, while noting that the overall trend outside the US is for a reduced effort in prohibition, rather than more. ""While $44bn [£28bn] is spent annually in the US to try to keep drugs off the street, other countries are not spending large amounts on enforcing drug prohibition."" Mr Miron believes there is an economic argument for the liberalisation of drugs. ""The attempt to prohibit people from using these substances generates ancillary harm. Not only are there direct costs of enforcement, but there is a creation of an underground market, which has extra violence, corruption, and poor quality control that spills over to everyone else in society,"" he says. He mentions that in many countries, it is not a high priority to prohibit cannabis, simply because poor countries have issues such as education and poverty to deal with, so fighting drugs is not at the top of their agenda. ""In some ways, it is a luxury of rich countries to worry about this issue and to spend resources thinking about it,"" he adds. Resisting change Not everybody is happy about liberalising the use of cannabis in any US state. Tom Gorman, director of the Healthy and Drug Free Colorado campaign, says a lot of money came from outside the state to try to get the motion passed. ""They outspent the people against the proposal five-to-one on radio and television commercials,"" he says. He says that since the 1970s there has been a movement in the US advocating that marijuana should be legalised, which began with the medicinal use of the drug because it ""was hard to argue against on compassionate grounds when people suffering from cancer and Aids might get relief from their pain"". He agrees that taxes and fees will raise revenue, in the same way that legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol do, but says the money raised will only cover about 10% of the damage that drugs cause - such as traffic fatalities, hospital emergencies, treatment and lost productivity. Overall, he believes the move will have a detrimental effect on the business climate and the image it sends out. ""Among issues that businesses are concerned about is what kind of work-force will they have, what will it do to education and will it alter the quality of life,"" he says. ""Furthermore, if any business wants a federal grant or contract, they have to ensure a drug-free workplace, families could be deterred from moving here, and it could attract the wrong kind of tourist,"" he says. According to Mr Miron at Harvard University, the US has historically been the most prohibitionist of any major country. ""There was hope amongst a lot of people that the Obama administration would be more open to the medicinal use of marijuana and it initially made some announcements in that direction, but then it later reversed its policy,"" he says. ""There does not seem to be any obvious prospect for change in US policies toward marijuana or other drugs,"" he adds.","The US states of Washington and Colorado have voted to legalise the possession and sale of marijuana for recreational purposes, in defiance of federal law, setting the stage for a potential showdown with President Barack Obama's administration."
"The note, which follows the polymer £5, will be issued on 14 September and has a portrait of Jane Austen on the 200th anniversary of the author's death. It is also the first Bank of England note to include a tactile feature to help visually impaired people. Meanwhile, a limited supply of a new £2 coin honouring Jane Austen has been put into circulation by the Royal Mint. The coin will initially only be available in tills at key locations in the Winchester and Basingstoke areas that have connections with Austen, including Winchester Cathedral and the Jane Austen House Museum. It will be circulated more widely across the UK later this year. Controversy The £10 note will be made of the same material as the £5 note, which means it also contains some traces of animal fat - an issue which caused concern for vegans and some religious groups when it was launched last September. A petition to ban the note attracted more than 100,000 signatures but the new £10 will again contain some tallow, which is derived from meat products. The Jane Austen quote on the note from Pride and Prejudice has also attracted some unfavourable comment. The quotation: ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"" is uttered by a character called Caroline Bingley who in fact has no interest in books and is merely trying to impress Mr Darcy, a potential suitor. But Mr Carney defended the choice. ""It captures much of her [Jane Austen's] spirit, at least in my mind,"" he said. ""It draws out some of the essence of some of her social satire and her insight into people's character. So it works on multiple levels."" A new polymer £20 featuring artist JMW Turner is due to be issued by 2020, but there are no plans to replace the current £50 note, which was released in 2011. The Bank of England says the new £10 notes contain sophisticated security features and are expected to last five years, which is two-and-a-half times longer than the current note. Security features of new £10 note: 'Universal appeal' The tactile feature was developed in conjunction with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner of each note. Bank notes are already in tiered sizes, and have bold numerals, raised print and differing colours to help blind and partially sighted people. Launching the note in Winchester Cathedral, Austen's final resting place, Mr Carney paid tribute to the author, saying: ""The new £10 note celebrates Jane Austen's work. Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published."" Victoria Cleland, the Bank's chief cashier, said: ""The new £10 note marks the next exciting step in our introduction of cleaner, safer, stronger polymer banknotes, and I am grateful to the cash industry for their work towards a smooth transition."" The design of the note includes the quote ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"" from Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and a portrait of the novelist based on an original sketch drawn by her sister Cassandra. Meanwhile, the Austen £2 coin, designed by Royal Mint graphic designer Dominique Evans, features Austen's silhouette, set in a period frame against a backdrop of Regency wallpaper. Ms Evans said: ""I imagined Jane Austen's framed silhouette as if it were in one of the houses featured in her books, on the wall of a corridor as guests passed by to attend a dance, perhaps in Pride and Prejudice, or on the wall in the home of Emma."" Austen had her first novel Sense and Sensibility published anonymously in 1811 at the age of 35.

"By Mario CacciottoloBBC News The most immediate change she'll notice is a minor black hole in her finances. The cost of a simple cut and blow dry for a woman is typically around £50 in London, though admittedly cheaper elsewhere. But it's almost always significantly less expensive if you're a man. Why? The price of going to a hairdresser has traditionally been higher if you're a woman wanting an elaborate hairstyle, but as men become more choosy about their coiffure, that distinction no longer always holds true. One barber shop in north London is joining a growing trend of charging for the style, not the gender of the head being coiffured. Klara Vanova, originally from the Czech Republic, runs Barberette, in Hackney, which she describes as a ""hairdressing hub, not a salon"" and is a gender neutral barber shop. She set up her business in 2012 ""because of my experience having short hair myself"". ""I have found it absolutely terrifying to go to the hairdressers and ask them for the haircut I want. They will persuade me that the haircut will look too masculine on me, or it will not suit me or it will be too short. ""We offer barber haircuts, which are sharp, clippered haircuts, as well as long hair or texturising haircuts and we don't put the gender on them. We put our foot down saying, well, why would you be charged more? ""So we offer the haircut the client wants, or if a woman wants very short hair, she knows she can come to us and we give her exactly that, as short as she wants or as long as she wants or as long as he wants."" Klara also says it is ""unbelievable"" that hairdressing remains a ""very genderised profession"" in an age when identity is broken down not only into men and women but into lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. ""We have a strong following from the LGBTQ community because they mostly find issues, or they find challenges at a hairdresser, again because it's so genderised. They didn't know where to go. ""Traditionally in hairdressing, women are charged much more than men, and if they challenge it then they say, oh, women's hair is different. So I would like to say, there is no difference between men and women haircuts or hair. It is just simply that in the hairdressing industry you will pay more if you are a woman."" The truth is it doesn't all boil down to how long it takes to style the hair. It's more to do with what economists call price discrimination: people who are willing to pay a higher price will end up being charged more. And women are often happier to spend more on their personal care than men, or were in the past. But this particular curl of the hairdressing world might be getting straightened out. Hairdressing, barbering and beauty industry Source: National Hairdressers' Federation A qualification was introduced by City and Guilds last year called Hairdressing and Barbering (NVQ) (6008), which it says ""does not qualify [students] to be a barber, but does prepare them for working in a salon that carries out services on male and female clients"". And the Supercuts chain of hairdressers also has one price list, which applies to both genders. So, the company says, if you are a man with long hair, you'll pay the same price for a cut and blow dry as if you are female. Equally, a woman who wants a buzz cut pays the same as a male customer. Jackie Lang, managing director of Regis UK which owns Supercuts, says this approach is growing in popularity among many hair and beauty salons. ""We are seeing the emergence of gender-neutral hair and beauty trends within the social landscape, so providing one generic pricing system helps us to promote fairness and equality throughout our salons,"" she said. The Toni&Guy hairdresser chain charges more for women to receive a cut and blow dry than men, although prices do vary between different salons. Its general manager, Brenda Mail, said the cost of its haircuts is determined by ""the length of time you are in the salon and being looked after by a technician or stylist"". She added: ""Traditionally, women would experience a longer appointment, due to the length of time it took to blow dry their hair and the techniques for cutting and colouring used. ""However, these days the difference in price for men and women is getting less all the time, as men are taking more and more time in the salon chair."" A spokeswoman for the National Hairdressers' Federation (NHF), the UK trade body for the hairdressing, barbering and beauty business, said some services historically associated with female clients, such as perms and colour, are now becoming more common in men's hairdressing. ""The costs should not vary just because of their gender, so men using these more complex services can expect to pay the higher prices women typically pay to cover their stylist's time, skills and the products used,"" she said. But the NHF says that one of the most common services for female clients is a cut, colour and blow dry, which can take two to three hours. It says factors such as the varying costs of colouring hair, a detailed consultation process and an application involving ""specialist techniques which can take years to master"" means many salons separate the costs of service on their menus, whether for men, women or colour services. ""However, gender-neutral price lists do help to dispel the myth that men and women are charged different prices, and make it clear that the price reflects the amount of time taken, the skills needed and the products used, not the client's gender,"" the spokeswoman added.

"The German bank unexpectedly released its latest results on Sunday, more than a week ahead of plan. Deutsche posted a pre-tax loss of 1.153bn euros (£900m) for the final quarter of 2013. The bank said that litigation costs and restructuring had weighed heavily on its financial performance. Litigation costs mounted up to 528m euros (£435.3m) for the period, while revenue fell 16%. Market strategist Ishaq Siddiqi, at ETX Capital, called the results a ``nasty set of numbers"". ""{They} have geared investors here in Europe for what could be an ugly earnings season for European banks,"" he added. At the end of last week the company's shares closed down 3% in New York after reports of a profit warning rattled already anxious investors. Deutsche Bank - Germany's largest lender - has faced some large problems in the past 12 months. In December 2013 it agreed to pay 1.4bn euros to settle a lawsuit with the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Rate rigging The lawsuit accused Deutsche Bank of breaking state and federal laws when it sold financial products backed by mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac between 2005 and 2007. Also in December it was among six banks fined $2.3bn (£1.4bn) by the European Commission after been found guilty of colluding to rig two global interest rate benchmarks. Deutsche Bank suffered the largest fine of the six - 725.36m euros - over rate fixing. For the year, it has set aside 2.5bn euros for various lawsuits. In Sunday's results statement, the bank's joint chief executives Juergen Fitschen and Anshu Jain said that they are confident of reaching their targets for 2015. Though they said that they ""expect 2014 to be a year of further challenges"". The bank will post a profit for 2013 overall, they added. Deutsche Bank had originally planned to release its results on 29 January.","Deutsche Bank's shares have fallen almost 4% in Monday morning trading, a day after it reported a surprise loss for the fourth quarter of 2013."
"Peter DayGlobal business correspondent This is the main summit on the spine of the Malvern Hills, where one day in the middle of the 14th Century William Langland lay down to sleep and dreamed one of the greatest English poems - Piers Plowman. Down below the hills reposes the spa town of Great Malvern. For many years this was the home of the composer Edward Elgar. Nothing has better evoked the passionate and melancholic expanses of the English countryside than his music. This ancient elemental atmosphere is breathed by every walker on the Malvern Hills. But there is more than the music of Elgar stirring in and around Great Malvern. It may look rural and remote, but the town is also one of the surprising centres of a new and expanding industry. It's on the front line of the battle against cybercrime. It may even be war. James Bond The story is unlikely but logical. More than 45 small cyber companies have sprung up in recent years in the surroundings of Malvern - Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. They are there very largely because of a decision made by the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the middle of the World War Two. In 1942, he ordained that the ground-breaking work being done by British scientists on the new technology of radar should be transferred to a part of the country less likely to be bombed by German planes. The government's Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) moved into Malvern College; their work helped to win the war. And science stayed in the town, until then best known for its spa and the Malvern Water it produced. In the early 1950s, a scientist working in Malvern foresaw in a published paper how the transistor might lead to the integrated circuit: the foundation of the computer. The government work expanded: the TRE changed its name and role several times, eventually becoming Dera - the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. Highly secretive, it not only tested armaments, it devised them. One of the departments eventually folded into Dera is supposedly the place to which James Bond came to ask his boss ""Q"" for the latest advanced gadgetry. Clever people worked for Dera and its predecessors. At one time Malvern was said to have one of the highest concentrations per head of PhDs in the country. They were all scientific civil servants, until the beginning of the 2000s. That was when much of Dera was privatised. It became a company with the pompous and meaningless name QinetiQ, and it put a lot of effort into winning overseas government clients. It has also been laying off staff in a commercial-company way probably not experienced in the old civil service days. Growing paranoia But the existence of Dera and then QinetiQ in Malvern had created a little island of technology expertise in the countryside, with computer security as a speciality. This was just the sort of thing you might expect a government agency to be good at, and it happens that Great Malvern is not very far from the huge government intelligence agency GCHQ in Cheltenham, and the headquarters of the Special Air Services (SAS) in Hereford. Intelligence and communications are in the air in and around Malvern, and now a cluster of small cyber security companies are springing up to exploit a growing paranoia about the dangers out there on the internet. Big company QinetiQ itself runs a security operation on its Malvern campus for corporate and government clients. They let me into the secure room there, but I was not allowed to record in the room. They say that on an average day, they identify and block eight cyber-attacks from snooping on or damaging their customers' networks. One of the many screens in the secure room gave the operators a constant feed of tweets and other social media communications. Hackers seemingly like to brag about the exploits they have done or are about to embark on, sometimes alerting the crime busters to an imminent attack. Brain-powered towns Many of the tiny start-ups are specialising so narrowly in a particular aspect of cyber-protection that it is difficult for outsiders such as me to grasp what they are doing. So they need to work together. To that end, an effervescent woman called Emma Philpott has formed something called the Malvern Cyber Security Cluster, a networking group for like-minded people. A returnee to the area with a hi-tech background, she was astonished to find that many of the various cyber-companies she ran into in and around the town did not know much about each other's existence. Now they meet regularly to exchange experiences, and to try to put the area on the cyber-map. Maybe to raise money, too, though these are new businesses fuelled by brain power and an injection of redundancy money or investment from friends and family. Ingenious companies can often be run on cash flow from early sales of software or hardware. Because I was new to the Malvern cluster, I was bothered by the fact that the new businesses I'd never heard of are so small, and might all be doing very overlapping things. Should there not be mergers and re-shapings so that all this activity is more co-ordinated, I asked? ""No,"" they said, ""collaboration is how we work anyway."" Small companies instinctively configure their informal working partnerships (with others in the area) in order to win a contract or carry it out. There are other clusters of computer security firms in the UK, normally in brain-powered towns such as Cambridge, where it is a particular speciality. As an outsider in Malvern, I was very surprised that such a cluster of clever companies should arise well away from any university. But they pointed out that QinetiQ and its predecessors had been just as much a centre of research as any university lab. Lovely country, clever people, that's how Malvern works. And in the future, it may be how many other places work and prosper. Working from everywhere has been made possible by the networked computer. Despite the lure of ultra concentrated Silicon Valley USA, working from anywhere may soon be a reality. That's what they say in and around Malvern, anyway. To hear more about Peter Day's visit to Great Malvern, listen to In Business on Radio 4 on Thursday, 16 January at 20:30 GMT, repeated on Sunday, 19 January at 21:30 GMT.",The view is quite glorious from the top of the Worcestershire Beacon: 360 degrees of the coloured counties of England fading into the distant mountains of greyer and less coloured Wales.
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York None of that seems to matter too much to Wall Street. The US president got a warm welcome in New York on Tuesday, where he spoke before a crowd of 1,350 hosted by the Economic Club of New York. Assorted whistles filled the room when his name was announced. Big applause followed his claim to have delivered and exceeded his campaign promises. ""Thank you,"" he said. ""I was waiting for that. I almost didn't get it."" It soon became clear that he needn't have worried. ""I think he felt comfortable with the crowd. It's his people,"" said one member of the audience, who works in New York property. Tuesday's speech was, in the words of that man, ""classic Trump"" - an hour-long monologue that covered familiar topics, including the rise in the US stock market and US trade policy. Mr Trump mixed prepared text touting his administration's accomplishments - primarily tax cuts and environmental deregulation - with his own asides, often digs at Democrats. Audience members - who were primarily white and male - afterward deemed the talk ""articulate"" and ""very inspirational"". ""I truly believe he's working for the American people, not himself,"" one man said. Those listening in hope of gleaning some intelligence on US-China trade talks were bound to be disappointed. A deal is close, the president said, as he has before. But those there for the selfie, cheesecake and general spectacle probably came away satisfied. ""Kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators - I meet 'em all,"" Mr Trump said, drawing a gasp of disbelieving laughter. The audience listened with equanimity as Mr Trump spoke about reviving the manufacturing sector and reversing America's losing record before the World Trade Organization (WTO). In fact, while the US manufacturing sector has added jobs, their numbers remain lower than they were before the financial crisis. And the US has a long-standing record of winning the vast majority of cases it brings before the WTO. Mr Trump also took the opportunity to criticise the Federal Reserve, which recently cut interest rates. Mr Trump said the bank should go further, pointing to even lower rates overseas. Those jibes got big applause. Mr Trump also seemed confident about the upcoming election. After all, Democrats such as Elizabeth Warren want tougher climate policies and higher taxes on billionaires. ""The truth is, you have no choice,"" he told the crowd of dark suits. ""Because the people we're running against are crazy."" He added of his election prospects, as he prepared to exit the stage: ""I think we're going to do very well. We're going to do it easily.""","By the reckoning of most economists, Donald Trump is engaged in a risky game, as he courts trade fights around the world, undermines the US central bank and runs up the national debt."
"The proposal for a chain based on its Tesco Finest food range comes nine months after the supermarket giant opened discount retailer Jack's. Although Tesco has set no date for its latest venture, upmarket rivals Marks & Spencer and Ocado saw their shares fall 3.5% and 4% respectively. Tesco's own share price was volatile. It made gains at the start of the day, then went into reverse, but was up 0.25% by mid-afternoon. Sainsbury's shares were down 0.8%, while Morrisons' were up 0.7%. The market reaction came after Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis unveiled the Finest stores plan to analysts and investors on Tuesday. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Lewis said: ""Tesco Finest as a brand is one of the largest food brands in the country. We have a very high percentage of more upmarket customers. ""The opportunity to curate that range and bring new things in a more convenient outlet is something that we have tested, is something we're interested in."" If it comes to fruition, the move has the potential to upset the plans of M&S and Ocado, who confirmed in February that they were setting up a joint venture. Under that deal, M&S will buy a 50% share of Ocado's retail business for £750m. It will then deliver M&S grocery products from September 2020 at the latest, when Ocado's deal with Waitrose expires. But while Tesco mulls the possibility of high-end outlets to compete with the likes of M&S's Simply Food stores, there appears to be a question mark over the future of Jack's, which was designed to take on discount retailers Lidl and Aldi. Tesco has not announced any plans for adding to Jack's nine stores. Since the discount chain opened its first outlets in September last year, it has sold £24m of products.",Shares in supermarkets have fallen sharply after Tesco said it was considering plans for a new chain of high-end convenience stores.
"The Japanese carmaker said it wanted to develop a self-driving car that could be mass produced. It comes as Toyota and Softbank created a new venture to develop transport services using autonomous vehicles. A series of accidents have left some consumers wary of driverless cars. 'Mobility services' Under the tie-up with GM, Honda will contribute approximately $2bn over 12 years to self-driving vehicle initiatives, which together with a $750m equity investment in Cruise, brings its total commitment to the project to $2.75bn, the two firms said in a statement. Analysts have said that GM is among the leaders in the development of self-driving vehicles. Earlier this year, Japan's Softbank invested $2.25bn in GM Cruise. Honda's investment in GM Cruise, together with Softbank's recent investment, values the firm at $14.6bn. Softbank has also announced a partnership with Toyota to provide ""new mobility services"", which includes the development of autonomous services. The Japanese pair have created a joint venture partner called MONET - short for mobility services - that will start with 2bn yen in capital. It plans to use Toyota's electric cars to provide autonomous services in the coming years. ""Possibilities include demand-focused just-in-time mobility services, such as meal delivery vehicles where food is prepared on the move, hospital shuttles where onboard medical examinations can be performed, mobile offices,"" the companies said. The rush to develop self-driving technology comes amid some consumer concern over safety. Uber briefly suspended self-driving cars tests in March after a fatal accident in the US, while a self-driving car owned by Apple was involved in an accident this month. San Francisco-based GM Cruise, which developed Chevy's first driverless cars, argues the technology it is working on allows self-driving cars to see more than a human driver would. In each car, 10 cameras are installed that take pictures at a frequency of 10 shots per second. ""We see more of what is going on around the car at any given time than a driver can,"" GM Cruise said.","Honda is to invest $2.75bn (£2.1bn) and take a stake in General Motors' self-driving unit, GM Cruise, as firms continue to team up in the race to develop autonomous vehicles."
"BP said underlying replacement cost profit, its definition of net income, was $86m (£66m) from July to September. That was down from $2.2bn a year earlier, but a big improvement on its massive second-quarter loss of $6.7bn. Chief executive Bernard Looney said that despite a ""challenging environment"", the firm was ""performing while transforming"". He added that despite financial pressures, BP would continue to pay a dividend to shareholders. In February, BP said it planned sharp cuts in carbon emissions by 2050. The company wants to be ""net zero"" by 2050 - that is, it wants the greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, and from the oil and gas it produces, to make no addition to the amount of greenhouse gases in the world's atmosphere by that date. It also wants to halve the amount of carbon in its products by 2050. In June, BP announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs after a slump in demand for oil due to Covid-19. It also forecast lower oil prices for decades to come as governments speed up plans to cut carbon emissions in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. That same month, it announced it was selling off its petrochemicals business to Ineos as part of its efforts to become a lower carbon firm. BP said the $5bn deal remained on track and, subject to approvals, was expected to complete by the end of the year. ""Having set out our new strategy in detail, our priority is execution and, despite a challenging environment, we are doing just that - performing while transforming,"" Mr Looney said. ""Major projects are coming online, our consumer-facing businesses are really delivering and we remain firmly focused on cost and capital discipline. ""Importantly, net debt continues to fall. We are firmly committed to our updated financial frame, including the dividend - the first call on our funds.""","BP returned to profit in the third quarter, but the global coronavirus crisis continued to hit demand for oil."
"Administrators EY released documents showing suppliers owed £484m of total debt estimated late on Friday at £884m. Among those listed is the warehouse operator at the centre of a dispute with the new owner which has led to the cancellation of all on-line orders. Mike Ashley's Sports Direct bought the chain just hours after it went into administration a week ago. Sports Direct is not legally obliged to pay suppliers money owed before its £90m buyout as their debts were part of the administration. Warehouse operator XPO Logistics is owed £30m and stopped processing orders last week because of a payment dispute. After an outcry from customers who had not received goods orders on line, House of Fraser said it would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. On Wednesday, House of Fraser took its website offline as deliveries began to back up. XPO operates two warehouses, in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, that handle House of Fraser's deliveries to stores as well as customers. The distributor said it had no comment to make when contacted by the BBC. It is among a number of suppliers to have taken action as negotiations over payment continue with the department store chain. The administrators said the total owed was ""subject to change"". 'Ongoing relationships' Fashion brand Jigsaw has removed stock from its 20 House of Fraser concessions, and Karen Millen - which is owed more than £950,000 - is understood to have followed suit. Others are owed even more: Mulberry is out of pocket by £2.4m, while All Saints is owed close to £1.8m and Giorgio Armani almost £1.6m. Sports Direct has said it wants to ""restore the right level of ongoing relationships"" with its brands. Mr Ashley has also vowed to keep most of House of Fraser's 59 stores open. 'Absolutely disgraceful' But some customers are angry about the treatment of their orders. One said on Twitter: ""Absolutely disgraceful. Ordered a £90 purse last Thursday. Yes a week ago for my daughters birthday. Not 1 email concerning delivery or info and now order cancelled and you say email in a few days!!! Get my money back ASAP."" Another said two-thirds of their husband's suit would not now be delivered. They tweeted: ""This was for our holidays! I don't have time to go back to Edinburgh with the trousers which are now totally useless! What do you suggest I do!"" Richard Lim of Retail Economics said there were ""kinks to be ironed out"" when big companies change hands, but warned that ""trust and loyalty are hard-won in retail"". He added: ""You would have thought that delivering a great service to customers would have been a priority for the company. ""Delivering goods into the hands of customers now has to be the top priority."" 'It is a lot of money to us' Kent-based Rob Brice and his wife were given £500 of House of Fraser gift vouchers by his grandmother for their wedding. Last week he placed an online order worth about £380. After hearing nothing for five days, he sent an email and was told they were no longer accepting gift cards, meaning ""my leftover value on the card was lost"". Another email said his order was cancelled and the sum would be refunded to the gift card - one he says is now no longer useable. Mr Brice has called House of Fraser but only gets an automated message. Neither has he had a response to emails and tweets. ""I'm going to look to call Trading Standards today to understand my customer rights in the matter, as it is a lot of money to us and would have been to my nan,"" he says. Six offers Meanwhile, EY has said there were six bidders for House of Fraser, with four - offering between £40m and £49m - being dismissed for various reasons. This left two potential names in the frame, with one of the remaining pair offering £1 to acquire the group on a solvent basis. This party then later proposed to acquire the business and assets following any insolvency for £100m - £10m more than what Sports Direct ultimately paid - before withdrawing. Also, EY said there will be £600,000, at best, left to pay unsecured creditors but the prospect of any payout is minimal. Q: What will happen to my House of Fraser online order? If items are in stock, shoppers may still receive them. However, customers are being emailed over the next two days to formally cancel pending orders and be refunded in full. Q: Can I return an unwanted item bought online for a refund? Yes. Anyone wanting to return existing purchases will have their statutory rights honoured. Q: What happens to gift vouchers? Customers with a store card should write to Gift Cards, 27 Baker Street, London, W1U 8AH and it will be replaced by one of equivalent value for use in future House of Fraser (but not Sports Direct) stores.","Big brands such as Mulberry, Giorgio Armani, Gucci and Prada face losses from the collapse of House of Fraser."
"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent It's raised far-reaching questions about campus culture and the boundaries of free speech. Much of this battle has been fought out in symbols and arguments over language. In Harvard, there are calls to ditch ""master"" from the academic title of ""house masters"", the heads of residential houses, because of the word's associations with slavery. The title has more to do with the British education system, with its ""school masters"" and ""house masters"". But in the US context, where ""master"" has different historical echoes, the word itself has become toxic. And reflecting the mood on campus, this argument has been accepted by the Harvard house masters themselves, who say they are now looking for a different title. They say the use of the word ""master"" causes discomfort and creates images of ""human subjugation"". Slavery links Harvard's Law School has been embroiled in a row over its crest, which displays the coat of arms of the Royall family. This is a link to an 18th Century college donor, Isaac Royall, who as well as establishing the college's first professorship in law, was a particularly brutal slaveholder. This has been the law school's official seal since the 1930s, but now this winter, following accusations that this was a racist emblem, a committee has been set up to reconsider its use. In Princeton, the dispute has focused on a school named after Woodrow Wilson. The former US president stands accused of holding deeply entrenched racist views, and protesters from the Black Justice League want the building renamed. In Yale, there has been a campaign to rename Calhoun College, to remove links with John Calhoun, a 19th Century advocate of slavery. More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch The thread linking the protests is the suggestion that racism is not a thing of the past but remains as an unresolved question on campus. There is a website, the Demands, listing the grievances in more than 70 universities where students have ""risen up"" against such prejudice. 'Tribal identity' But why are so many protests hitting universities now? Carol Christ, director of the Center for Studies in Higher Education, University of California, Berkeley, says that ""symbolic fights are always about real and current political issues"" and in the US, the issue of race is never far from the surface. ""Race is so traumatic and central an issue in American culture - with both the history of slavery and the genocide of Native Americans always present,"" says Dr Christ. The sensitivity over race and discrimination was heightened by events such as the shooting of a young black man by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. ""That created a lot of activism on college campuses,"" Dr Christ says. And the arguments over emblems and traditions are part of a wider battle over identity and whose culture should be commemorated on campus. ""Colleges and universities in the United States make a huge amount of their history, they're always telling their story, it's the way in which they try and make almost a tribal identity,"" Dr Christ says. But these stories might make difficult listening for minority groups, with the college names and emblems having echoes of slavery and segregation. ""They will feel an alienation from the stories that they're told to accept as part of their college identity,"" says Dr Christ. Economic significance What makes this an even more significant struggle is that university is now seen as the gateway to a better job. Even though universities might have a public commitment to inclusion and diversity, protesters have accused them of remaining the domain of a white middle and upper class. Only about 5% of lecturers in US universities are black, according to official figures. Protesters have argued that universities have turned a blind eye to a long legacy of discrimination. ""It's about the increasing sense that college is the way to economic security and power in modern society,"" Dr Christ says, adding this is combined with fears prestigious colleges are increasingly being dominated by the wealthy. Another provocative thread in the campus disputes has been about free speech and whether activities or language or opinions should be blocked if they upset some students. This has included the concept of ""safe space"" where students can be protected from language or arguments that might offend them. But this has been criticised by opponents as contradicting the intellectual purpose of a university, which should be about challenging ideas and contesting beliefs. 'Narcissistic' Among the most forthright attacks came from Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University. Dr Piper told his students: ""This is not a day care. This is a university."" And he warned: ""Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic. Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims. ""Anyone who dares challenge them and thus makes them feel bad about themselves, is a 'hater', a 'bigot', an 'oppressor' and a 'victimiser'."" There have also been arguments that changing the names of buildings is a way of avoiding uncomfortable questions about past attitudes, rather than addressing the historic legacy of universities. But this simmering winter protest shows no sign of subsiding. The president of the University of Missouri resigned last month, amid claims he had failed to respond adequately to allegations of racism. And this week, a Yale lecturer, caught up in a row over the right to wear Halloween costumes, even if they caused offence, decided to step down from teaching. Dr Christ says that ""because race is so vexed and turbulent a subject"" in the United States, the ""controversies will continue"".","Universities across the United States are caught up in a wave of protests swirling around issues of race, identity and how institutions should respond to their history."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter Millions of her customers could have had their data - including bank details - stolen in what the company has described as a ""concerted cyber-attack"". I am told that TalkTalk first started experiencing ""latency"" problems with its internet servers during the day on Wednesday. That means information that should have been transferred easily between different parts of the business started slowing down. TalkTalk shut down its website overnight as what is called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack took hold. I am told that attack ""punched a lot of holes"" in TalkTalk's systems and allowed the attackers to gain access to the customer data. TalkTalk will have to reveal pretty quickly whether all that data was encrypted. TalkTalk had earlier called in the police and its cyber-security provider - a major global company which I have been asked not to name. It does not appear that TalkTalk knows whether the attack came from within Britain or abroad. And of course in all situations like this, companies are dealing with groups that operate in the shadows and across national borders. One thing it is worth noting at this early stage is that there have been a number of recent reports about groups attacking companies and subsequently demanded ransoms in Bitcoins. One group is named DD4BC, which has been accused of emailing companies with demands to be paid. It is as yet unclear whether TalkTalk has been the target of a similar attack, but I am told it is already a strong line of inquiry. UPDATE 11:00 Following my earlier blog, I have been contacted by a number of companies which say there was a significant upsurge in Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on Wednesday, the day TalkTalk was infiltrated. Some appear to be connected with extortion, with ransoms demanded in Bitcoins. This appears to be a far wider problem. Even if it is part of a wider attack, it is still very bad news for TalkTalk, which has been dealing with high levels of customer complaints already about its service. And it had two more minor data breaches earlier this year. With Sky and BT much bigger providers, TalkTalk knows that this major infiltration by cyber-criminals is very serious. Investors seem to agree. TalkTalk's share price is down nearly 10% this morning.","Dido Harding, the chief executive of TalkTalk, has a firestorm on her hands."
"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC News The online-only bank, owned by Co-Operative Bank, said it was working urgently to resolve the problem. But the latest service outage proved to be the ""last straw"" for longtime customer Emma Hopkinson-Spark. After 16 years, she left Smile Bank on Friday after she was unable to view a crucial re-mortgage payment. ""I'm really disappointed in Smile Bank,"" Ms Hopkinson-Spark, chief of staff at a tech consultancy business in Weston-super-Mare, told the BBC. ""The outages this week were the tipping point."" Ms Hopkinson-Spark said she had not been able to access her online banking account for several days. Although she can still withdraw money from cash machines and pay for items using her debit card, she cannot send payments or view her payments. ""Yesterday my husband rang me in a flap saying he was trying to pay for groceries and didn't have money in his account,"" she said. ""He needed me to transfer money to his account and I couldn't."" Her frustration came to a head when her mortgage firm said they had sent a payment of almost £100,000 to her current account, but she could not see it there or do anything with the funds. She decided to close her current account, cash ISA and savings account with the bank and is transferring her funds to a different bank. Smile Bank, which has around 100,000 customers, has apologised for problems with its online banking and mobile app, but it was unable to provide the BBC with a reason for the outage, or say when the problem would be fixed. ""We're sorry that our Smile customers have been unable to use our mobile app and online banking as they would usually in recent days,"" the company said in a statement. ""We are working hard to restore their access as soon as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. ""Customers can use their cards and make transactions as normal and if they need support with their account they can call our customer service team."" 'We're getting really panicked' Vicky Wevell, a self-employed editor in Nailsea, near Bristol who has been with the bank for 20 years, said Smile Bank's mobile app had gone downhill in recent years, with outages for hours at a time. Like other Smile Bank customers who spoke to the BBC, she said a lack of communication during the recent issues had made her worried about the safety of her funds. ""I'm really angry actually and have been getting progressively angrier this week,"" she said. ""It's less to do with the outage and more to do with their communication."" She said she was also on the verge of switching banks, because she could not see which invoices for work done had been paid by her clients. ""How are we supposed to do any business?"" she said. ""[We're] getting really panicked, is our money secure?"" Making enquiries Jackie Smart, an office administrator in Aylesbury, said it took days for the bank to put a notice up about the outage on its website and communication remains difficult. ""I'm feeling frustrated and worried because I don't know what's happening. You can get through on the automated service to hear your balance when you ring through, but it's actually waiting to speak to somebody that takes a long time,"" she said. Set up in 1999, Smile Bank was one of the earliest online-only banks. Its parent company, Co-Operative Bank, is owned by a number of hedge funds, which last year were reportedly exploring a sale of the business. The BBC understands that the outage is caused by an issue that is only affecting Smile Bank's platforms, but not other brands owned by Co-Operative Bank. Smile Bank customers have been advised to call the bank if they require assistance with their accounts on 03457 212212 during opening times, which are: Monday-Friday 08:00-18:00 BST, and on weekends between 09:00-17:00 BST. As call waiting times may vary, the bank told the BBC that customers can also to contact Smile Bank's Twitter and Facebook accounts to make queries.",Smile Bank customers have been unable to access their online banking accounts for five days in a row.
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent The UN describes the findings as ""staggering"" and representing a ""learning crisis"". Much of the focus of international aid in education has been on the lack of access to schools, particularly in poorer countries in sub-Saharan Africa or in conflict zones. But this new research from the Unesco Institute for Statistics warns of the lack of quality within schools - saying more than 600 million school-age children do not have basic skills in maths and reading. Huge divide In sub-Saharan Africa, the research suggests 88% of children and adolescents will enter adulthood without a basic proficiency in reading. And in central and southern Asia, 81% are not reaching an adequate level in literacy. The report warns any ambitions for social and economic progress will be stifled without a literate and numerate population. In North America and Europe, only 14% of young people leave education at such a low level. But, the UN research suggests, only 10% of the world's school-age children live in these more affluent, developed regions. ""Many of these children are not hidden or isolated from their governments and communities - they are sitting in classrooms,"" said Silvia Montoya, director of the Unesco Institute for Statistics. She said the report was a ""wake-up call for far greater investment in the quality of education"". This problem of ""schooling without learning"" was also highlighted by the World Bank in a report this week. It warned that millions of young people in low- and middle-income countries were receiving an inadequate education that would leave them trapped in low-paid and insecure jobs. The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, introducing the report, said the failures in education for so many represented ""a moral and economic crisis"". Researchers warned of pupils in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Nicaragua who after years in school were unable to do simple sums or read simple sentences. A basic level of proficiency in primary school was reached by 99% of pupils in Japan, but by only 7% of pupils in Mali, they said. There were also wide gulfs within countries. At the end of primary school in Cameroon, only 5% of girls from the poorest families were at a level to continue with their education, compared with 76% of girls from wealthy families, the report said. What's to blame? The World Bank study examined the factors underlying such poor achievement: The World Bank's chief economist, Paul Romer, said there had to be a more honest admission that for many children being in school did not mean worthwhile lessons. He said progress would depend on recognising that ""the facts about education reveal a painful truth"". Lack of testing The report warned of a lack of scrutiny over standards and the absence of even basic information about pupil achievement. While the debate in Western countries has been about excessive testing, the World Bank said that in poorer countries, there was ""too little measurement of learning, not too much"". But the researchers also pointed to countries that had made progress, such as South Korea and Vietnam. And at the United Nations last week there were international pledges for greater investment in education. ""I have decided to set education as a top priority of French development and foreign policy,"" said French President Emmanuel Macron. Former UK Prime Minister and UN education envoy Gordon Brown said he wanted the Global Partnership for Education, which channels aid to education projects, to have funds worth $2bn (£1.5bn) by 2020. The European Union announced that 8% of its humanitarian budget would be spent on education. For children missing school because of the conflict in Syria, the Education Above All Foundation and Unicef, along with other charities, committed an extra $60m (£45m). ""Funding our education goal will do far more than place a child at a desk. It will unleash opportunity and hope,"" said Mr Brown. More from Global education Ideas for the Global education series? Get in touch.","Six out of 10 children and teenagers in the world are failing to reach basic levels of proficiency in learning, warns a hard-hitting report from the United Nations."
"Citizens Advice says that half of those on a zero hours basis - more than 900,000 people - are not aware of their holiday benefits. The charity said bosses are either ignorant of workers' rights, or are ""deliberately flouting the law"". It is calling on the next government to step in to help protect workers. Based on the most recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, Citizens Advice also says that two out of five people on temporary contracts do not know they can take paid time off. Zero hours contracts allow employers to hire staff with no guarantee of work. Unlike the so-called ""gig economy"", where people are paid on a job-by-job basis, those on zero hours contracts are entitled to basic rights such as rest breaks, the National Minimum Wage and paid leave. Citizens Advice said that while some employers mislead employees about holiday entitlement due to the ignorance of bosses, others purposefully flout the law and exploit workers' confusion. 'Dirty tactics' It cites an example of one man who worked 48 hours a week in a care home for five years. He was told that staff who worked at night did not get paid holiday. He subsequently discovered he had missed out on £8,900 worth of paid leave. Of the 185,000 people who sought help from Citizens Advice in the last financial year, 10,000 were cases about holiday. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said: ""Thousands are missing out on rights they are entitled to due to a lack of awareness, confusion and in some cases deliberate dirty tactics by employers. ""With more than half of employers having staff working shifts or variable hours, action needs to be taken now to protect workers rights."" Citizens Advice wants a single body set up to oversee enforcement of all employment rights and a £50 cap on employment tribunal fees. Sports Direct came under fire last year for its working conditions, including at its Shirebrook distribution centre. While the retailer announced that people who work in its shops will be moved onto guaranteed hours, those in the distribution centre will remain on zero hours contracts.","Thousands of workers on zero hours contracts miss out on paid holiday because they are lied to or do not know their rights, it has been claimed."
"The £56bn programme has too ambitious a schedule and rising costs could mean that not all its intended benefits are delivered, the NAO said. The NAO said the 2026 target opening date for the first phase was ""at risk, despite good progress"". But HS2 Ltd said it was confident that it could achieve its objectives. The first phase of HS2, linking London and the West Midlands, is due to be completed in 10 years' time. The next section, running as far as Crewe, is due to open a year later in 2027, with a further extension to Manchester and Leeds due to be finished by 2033. The project cleared its final Commons stage in March and is now being considered by the House of Lords. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent The NAO report was written before the Brexit vote, so it doesn't speculate on what effect, if any, it could have on HS2. Still, this behemoth of a project involving £56bn of public money would appear to be safe, for now. The Department for Transport's very keen to send out a ""business as usual"" message, promising that planned investment in our roads and railways won't suffer. MPs are due to vote on phase one of HS2 later this year. If they approve the bill, that's effectively the green light to start building the line from London to Birmingham. And MPs approved the project overwhelmingly the last time they had a vote. The company building the line, HS2 Ltd, is also about to hand out £11bn worth of contracts in the next couple of months. The winning companies can't begin building work until the HS2 bill has royal assent, due by the end of the year, but they will be looking to recruit, hire vehicles, get plans in place. Having said all of that, who'd be brave enough to predict anything right now. Budget worries ""HS2 is a large, complex and ambitious programme which is facing cost and time pressures,"" said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO. ""The unrealistic timetable set for HS2 Ltd by the Department [for Transport] means they are not as ready to deliver as they hoped to be at this point. ""The Department now needs to get the project working to a timescale that is achievable."" The NAO said phase one of HS2 was currently forecast to cost £27.4bn, exceeding available funding by £204m. The estimated cost of phase two was also over budget, the NAO said, although potential savings had been identified. The NAO added that integrating HS2 into the wider UK rail network ""is challenging and poses risks to value for money"". In its response, HS2 Ltd it welcomed the report ""and its confirmation that, whilst many challenges remain, the project is on track to deliver its strategic scope and to do so on budget"". ""The role of the NAO is to challenge projects such as HS2 and through that challenge, improve the way they deliver for the taxpayer,"" said the chief executive of HS2, Simon Kirby. ""This report does this and we accept that challenge. It also, however, recognises the real progress we have made in taking the concept of HS2 and moving it nearer reality."" David Higgins, the non-executive chair of HS2 Ltd, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the timetable was ""tight"", but added: ""We know the project can be delivered in that time."" He said the projected overspend on phase one represented less than 1% of the cost, which was not excessive ""on a project of this scale at this stage"". Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: ""HS2 is on track and the National Audit Office agrees. We have strong cross party support and are on schedule to gain the powers needed to start building HS2, which the NAO acknowledges is a significant achievement.""","The HS2 high-speed rail project has an ""unrealistic timetable"" and faces major cost pressures, a report by the National Audit Office has said."
"LinkedIn expects first quarter revenue of up to $460m (£282m), which is below analyst projections for $469m. The company has also seen sales growth slow for the fourth straight quarter. Its poor showing comes after Twitter saw a steep sell-off in its stock following its disappointing first public earnings report. LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner said the company is currently looking for new sources of growth. ""We are investing significantly in a focused number of long-term initiatives that will allow us to realize our vision to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce,"" he said in a statement. The California-based company also plans to further develop its mobile application and strengthen its jobs vacancy business. About one quarter of LinkedIn's traffic now comes from mobile devices. Mr Weiner also said they plan to expand into China, the world's most populous country, and recently appointed a new executive to head operations there. LinkedIn is the only major US social network not blocked in China. New purchase LinkedIn also announced on Thursday that it had bought data analytics company Bright Media for about $120m. Bright Media is a two-year-old start-up which uses algorithms to match job candidates with prospective employers. Its founder Eduardo Vivas said in a statement that they were excited to join LinkedIn. ""The company shares a similar vision and is equally obsessed about using data and algorithms to connect prospects and employers,"" he said. LinkedIn makes the most of its money from selling service subscriptions to job recruiters, who use the website as a database for potential candidates.

"Chris CookPolicy editor, Newsnight The healthcare company Circle has given notice that it may end its contract to run Hinchingbrooke Health Care NHS Trust, a small hospital in Cambridgeshire. In a statement, the company said it had ""reluctantly concluded that operating the franchise is no longer viable under current terms"". This could mean termination - or renegotiation. This is a bit of a moment - Hinchingbrooke was a totem for what the private sector could do to help the NHS. It has been the subject of praise from the right, in particular. But it is also no surprise. The contract Circle agreed has long been assumed to be undeliverable. It rested on the assumption that the company could do amazing things. 'Long-term problems' The background is that Hinchingbrooke has long been a struggling hospital. It is small, and wedged between much bigger providers. According to the internal NHS mythology, it was only saved from closure in the 1990s because John Major was the local MP. Its financial problems were severe. By 2007-08, it ran a £16m deficit on turnover of £73m. That is why, in 2009, the Department of Health gave local NHS bodies the green light to franchise its management out - to bring in outsiders to run it, in the hope they could save it. After a tendering process, a 10-year contract was agreed with Circle in late 2011. The deal envisaged that Circle could be required to put in up to £5m to cover losses by the hospital, and up to £2m to cover termination costs if they decided to walk away from the deal. So Circle signed up for up to a £7m potential loss. But if they turned around the hospital, moved it into surplus and saved enough money from its budget to repay £48m towards the hospital's outstanding debts, they would also be able to take £35m in profit. Contract 'undeliverable' Today, Circle said that it has already put in nearly £5m - and has decided that it is not worth persevering to turn it around on current terms. In its statement, Circle blames the hospital inspectors, parts of whose early critical reports have already been leaked. ""We understand the CQC (Care Quality Commission) report will be published soon, and expect it to be both unbalanced and to disagree with many of its conclusions,"" the statement reads. They also have a crack at NHS policy: ""There have been significant changes in the operational landscape for NHS hospitals since the contract was originally procured in 2009, including unprecedented increases in accident and emergency attendances, insufficient care places for patients awaiting discharge, and funding levels that have not kept pace with demand. "" But I find myself coming back to the contract. It always looked undeliverable. Circle does seem to have improved the management of the hospital. But, under its plans, it anticipated making a 5% efficiency gain in the first year. In the second? 11%. That is rather a lot. But it goes on. For the remaining eight years, the hospital would need to become 5.9% more efficient, on average, every single year. Without a break. That would have been an astounding, extraordinary achievement. Some readers with private business experience may not think too much of that, but remember this is an NHS hospital. Unlike a private company, it is not allowed to drop lots of key services because they have thin margins or are loss-making. Almost from the outset, Circle was off-track. This is embarrassing for advocates of private provision in the NHS, and creates great uncertainty for the healthcare system in the east of England. Future of outsourcing But there are reasons to be more cheerful. Firstly, the hospital is probably in a better position for their involvement. The NHS also successfully drafted a contract to share risk with a private contractor - the Department of Health has not lost its nerve and bailed Circle out. (At least, not yet.) That is quite an important fact. A major problem in public outsourcing is that the government often finds ways to help out its private providers. If outsourcing is done properly, private providers should squeal, fail and walk away fairly regularly. So what does this mean for the future of outsourcing? The politics of it are tough. It is embarrassing if private providers fail, but a sign of failure if they always succeed. The pro-marketeers look a bit more sheepish than usual today. It will certainly make it harder to be pro-market within the NHS. The Department of Health is already pretty quiet about its pro-market health reforms. And since it agreed to a contract that looked so hard to deliver, it needs to take a look at its own decisions. Finally, this case also tells you something about life inside the NHS. Circle's complaints about financial and policy-change risk within the system are real and fair: hospitals exist within a rollercoaster of constantly changing income and expectations. The system is designed to protect the Treasury and leaves hospitals to cope. Circle walked away. NHS hospitals cannot.","Is the great experiment finally over? The only fully outsourced hospital in England may be coming back, for the moment at least, into public hands."
"By Joe MillerBBC News The British-based shipping company also wants courts to cancel the Department for Transport's settlement with Eurotunnel, and impose civil penalties. In March, the DfT agreed to pay £33m to Eurotunnel, after the cross-channel operator sued for not being considered for a no-deal Brexit freight contract. The DfT said it acted appropriately. ""This cross-government decision helped protect vital freight capacity for medical supplies to enter the country, in the event the UK left the EU without a deal,"" a spokesperson said. As part of the agreement with Eurotunnel, the French company was mandated to spend £33m of taxpayers' money on improvements to the infrastructure of its terminal in Folkestone. P&O's lawyers claim that this stipulation amounts to a public contract, and that the £33m settlement ""was not, and could not be, a genuine estimate of Eurotunnel's alleged losses"". It says that such an agreement, which includes building work, ""could only lawfully have been entered into following a duly advertised and competitive tender process"". P&O has also sought a judicial review into the actions of the DfT, which is run by Chris Grayling, and claims that the settlement amounts to a subsidy for Eurotunnel. This, P&O argues, would be unlawful state aid. 'Minimise disruption' In court filings, P&O cites a note from a joint government statement on the day that the Eurotunnel settlement was announced, which reads: ""We have agreed to support a series of measures that will ease the pressure and minimise disruption, at our EU borders, as well as improve security."" P&O argues that those concerns ""manifestly do not justify expenditure solely at Eurotunnel's terminal… but apply to and justify similar expenditure at the terminals and for facilities of Eurotunnel's Short Sea competitors"". Procurement expert and former government lawyer Andrew Dean, of Clifford Chance LLP, told the BBC that P&O was seeking to ""rip up the settlement agreement"". The shipping company argues that the DfT had ""contracted Eurotunnel to provide the UK government with £33m worth of infrastructure-related works or services, which should have been put out to tender in accordance with public procurement rules"". If P&O's case is successful, the government could also face challenges from construction and facilities management companies, which might have bid for the work at Eurotunnel's terminal if there had been a tender process. The pool of potential claimants would then be much wider than just ports, rail and ferry companies. Earlier this month, following the extension of the Brexit deadline to 31 October, the DfT cancelled its contracts with Brittany Ferries and DFDS to provide extra ferry services in the event that Britain left the EU without a deal. The cancellations came just months after the DfT was forced to scrap a contract with a third provider, the ferryless Seaborne Freight, which could have cost the taxpayer more than £50m.",P&O Ferries is seeking almost £33m in damages from the government over its handling of a challenge to ferry contracts under a no-deal Brexit.
"Campaign group UK Uncut Legal Action claims the taxpayer missed out on up to £20m as a result of what it calls a ""sweetheart"" deal. The one-day hearing is due to go ahead at the High Court in London later. HMRC admits it made a mistake in finalising the deal, but says it did not do anything illegal. It says that at most the taxpayer lost between £5m and £8m, and that it has since changed the way it negotiates tax deals with big companies. Human error HMRC discovered that over a period of years in the 1990s, Goldman Sachs had avoided tax by routing bonus payments through a subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands. By doing so, the investment bank had not paid National Insurance (NI) contributions. But instead of going through a legal process to recover the money that they believed was owed to the taxpayer, HMRC's then boss, Dave Hartnett, decided to come to an arrangement with Goldman Sachs directly, in what is known as a ""bespoke settlement"". After a meeting with the bank's tax director, Mike Housden, in November 2010, the company agreed to pay the NI contributions that it owed, an amount that has not been made public. However, HMRC decided that, for technical reasons, it could not collect the interest that had accrued. Subsequently it admitted it had made a mistake, and said it should have collected up to £8m that was owed by the bank. ""It was the result of human error,"" a spokesman told the BBC. A whistle-blower, Osita Mba, later told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that the amount may have been nearer to £20m. HMRC rejects that assessment. Taxpayer value UK Uncut Legal Action (ULA), an offshoot of the anti-cuts action group UK Uncut, claims that HMRC's action was in contravention of its statutory duty to collect taxes properly, fairly and equally. ""We believe that the deal with Goldman Sachs is unlawful,"" Anna Walker of ULA told the BBC. ""We want to show HMRC that doing these tax deals is not politically, legally or morally acceptable."" Although details of the NI back-payments from Goldman Sachs have not been made public, HMRC has always insisted it was ""a good settlement"". The claim that the taxpayer received good value from it is supported by a report from the National Audit Office published in June 2012. A retired tax judge, Sir Andrew Park, examined five bespoke settlements with big companies, including the deal reached with Goldman Sachs. The report concluded that ""all five settlements were reasonable, and at least one may have been better than reasonable"". It also suggested that reaching a settlement could be cheaper for the taxpayer, as it avoided expensive legal costs. The report said that if both sides cannot agree, litigation can be ""long and very expensive"". It was also acknowledged in the report that HMRC had since tightened up its procedures. Following the hearing, judgement is expected to be announced at a later date. UK Uncut Legal Action's costs are being funded by public donations, which have amounted to £20,000.",A judge is being asked to decide if HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) acted illegally by letting investment bank Goldman Sachs off part of its tax bill.
"Profits increased 13% compared with the first quarter of 2017, hitting almost $1.38bn (£1bn). International demand, including in the UK and Germany, helped to drive the growth, the fast food chain said. The firm, which had faced tougher competition from new restaurant chains, has been working to win back customers. It has introduced higher-end burger offerings, renovated restaurants, added more technology and switched to fresher ingredients as part of a turnaround plan that is showing signs of working. Sales at McDonald's restaurants opened at least 13 months increased more than 5% in the first three months of the year, and guest counts rose almost 1% - the fifth consecutive quarter of rising customer visits, the firm said. International growth In the US, sales at such stores increased 2.9% year-on-year during the quarter, though guest counts declined. In established international markets, such as the UK and Canada, comparable sales rose 7.8%. ""[This] shows the power of the brand... globally the numbers were outstanding,"" said Peter Saleh, an analyst with brokerage BTIG. ""The results were very impressive, actually more impressive than we initially had anticipated."" Total revenue was $5.1bn, down 9% from the same period last year, a decline the firm said was due to its move to franchise more restaurants, rather than operate them directly. Operating costs also fell, however, and McDonald's said it expected to add a net total of 600 restaurants this year around the globe. Second wave of UK strikes The UK is one of the strongest markets for McDonald's, reporting 12 years of consistent quarterly growth. But the firm could face negative publicity in the UK this week as a second wave of strikes hits some of its restaurants. It concerns a dispute over pay and conditions involving members of the Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union. Just 11 workers at five restaurants - in Manchester, Cambridge, Crayford, south-east London, and two in Watford - will walk out on 1 May. They are demanding a minimum salary of £10 per hour, an end to lower ""youth rates"" of pay and greater flexibility in working hours. While the number is small, the first ever McDonald's UK strikes in September involved a similar number of workers and attracted widespread media attention. A spokeswoman told the BBC: ""Over the last three years, we have taken a number of additional steps to ensure McDonald's UK remains a great place to work. ""Since September 2015, we have made three significant pay moves, and maintained the many benefits we offer, from the great training, and development opportunities, to payment of overnight premiums, which so many businesses have taken from their people in recent times. She added: ""As promised last year, everyone has now been offered a minimum guaranteed hours contract. ""Despite this, around 80% of our people have selected to stay on flexible contracts because they value the opportunity to fit their work around their other commitments."" McDonald's owns or franchises more than 37,000 restaurants in 120 countries around the world.","McDonald's Corp has reported strong sales in the first three months of the year, causing share prices to jump about 5% in morning trade in New York."
"By Lindsay BakerBusiness reporter Yet it seems that reports of its imminent demise may have been exaggerated. In a new twist, established e-commerce businesses are increasingly opening physical stores. This emerging trend, labelled ""clicks to bricks"" or ""e-tail to retail"", looks set to inject some much-needed vigour back into local High Streets. A recent survey in the United States of the shopping habits of 18- to 25-year-olds suggests that just over two thirds of them - some 68% - prefer to shop in stores for clothing and shoes. ""Retail observers have been significantly overestimating our use of online and digital technology for shopping - we like shopping in stores,"" says Nicole Flasch-Mihalko of LIM College, which carried out the survey with the National Retail Federation in the US. Online brands are now acting on this. In the UK, menswear brand Orlebar Brown, whose swimming shorts Daniel Craig famously sported in the James Bond movie Skyfall, has recently opened three London stores. A physical store offers shoppers the chance to touch, feel and try on merchandise, and for luxury brands in particular, this is important. Engineering connections For instance, Rapha, which started as an online business in 2004 selling high-performance cyclewear, opened its first store or Cycle Club in San Francisco in 2011. Now it also has branches in London, Osaka, New York and Sydney. Rapha says its stores have been a big hit with customers, offering a showcase for its clothing but also acting as a place to absorb cycle culture - to drink coffee, join in organised cycle rides and watch major races on big screens. ""The Cycle Clubs are conceived as meeting places for road racing fans and great places for like-minded people to hang out,"" says Rapha's chief executive Simon Mottram. ""Rapha is the host of these places and it's great for us to engineer connections between customers, not just between the customer and brand."" And he says its stores are also helping Rapha to better understand its customers. ""It's hard for brands to engage with their customers in a purely digital way. ""That may be fine if your business is only about conducting simple transactions, but if you want to truly connect with a customer and create a deep, ongoing relationship with them, then a physical experience is invaluable. ""Many people like to shop in bricks and mortar locations. There is the possibility of theatre and human interaction there - these things shouldn't be underestimated."" There is a new model of retailing emerging, ""with brands having a core website that covers the majority of purchases"", he says. ""With a number of high-touch, physical 'brand experiences' on top of that platform - allowing the customer to really engage with the brand."" 'It's a whole journey' For Bec Clarke, founder and chief executive of jewellers Astley Clarke, it is all about ""allowing customers to shop how they want"". Her firm has seen rapid online growth, and has now opened a showroom and store at its London headquarters - as well as supplying a number of UK department stores. Within the next few months it also plans to supply several major stores in the United States. ""There's a long consideration process to buying jewellery,"" Clarke explains, as we sit on plush sofas in her firm's showroom, the decor complete with mirrored furniture and luxuriant cream padded walls. ""It's a whole journey of trying on and thinking about it and trying on again, and we have to allow the customer to go on that journey,"" she says. ""It's also important for our bespoke service - clients like to see and touch the gemstones. ""The heart of our business is online, but we have a 'channel agnostic' approach, which is where the world is moving to."" 'Create a storm' For High Street landlords with vacant space to rent as well as online start-ups this trend is good news, says Ross Bailey, founder and chief executive of Appear Here. His firm brings together shop landlords and mainly e-commerce entrepreneurs, with the aim of making renting a pop-up or permanent physical shop easier and more flexible. ""Pop-ups helps fill in any awkward pauses that a landlord may have, and it's good for brand building, too,"" he says. ""It can be hard and expensive to get noticed online now. ""But if you spring up offline - even for a short time - shoppers will love the interaction and share their experience of going there by tweeting or sharing an image online. ""You can create a storm."" Blurring boundaries Some e-commerce brands are moving into so-called guide shops - allowing shoppers to try on items, and then order in-store for home delivery. Bonobos menswear is at the forefront of this phenomenon, and has opened guide shops across the United States. Increasingly it seems, the channels are blurring. Bonobos founder and chief executive Andy Dunn argues that this is the future of retailing, but that ""it is also the past"". ""When you look at retailers who are thriving in this environment, it's the brands focused on delivering a strong service experience. ""It is one of the ironies of our time that a digital medium, the internet, is making the in-person shopping experience a more humane one,"" he says.","With the inexorable rise of online shopping, there have been gloomy predictions about the future of the bricks and mortar, High Street store."
"Burger King, KFC and Pret A Manger are opening certain restaurants around the country for delivery only. Government guidelines state that while restaurants and pubs have to close, they can prepare food for collection or delivery. The chains had decided to temporarily close as the lockdown took effect. 'Lifting spirits' Burger King is to reopen four restaurants: two in Bristol, one in Coventry, and one in Swindon, with a pared-down menu. Staff will wear masks and gloves and will be trained in running delivery-only kitchens hygienically, the fast food chain said. There will be stringent cleaning measures, and staff will get social distancing training. The restaurants will also donate 1,000 meals per week to staff working at NHS hospitals in the vicinity of the reopened restaurants. Katie Evans, marketing director at the chain, said Burger King hoped the re-openings would go ""some way to lifting our customers' spirits in these difficult times"". She added: ""We want to demonstrate how appreciative everyone at Burger King UK is of [NHS staff] efforts in these unprecedented times."" Fried chicken for the NHS KFC said it had reopened 11 UK restaurants in the past week for delivery only, with a limited menu. The restaurants are in Aldershot, Birmingham, Glasgow, Ipswich, London, Manchester, Portsmouth, Stockport, and Tamworth. The fast food chain says it has donated ""thousands of meals from all our open restaurants to those on the frontline, including the NHS and key workers, in partnership with Deliveroo, and will continue to do so each week whilst the situation continues"". KFC said it had decided to close temporarily on 23 March ""with the wellbeing of our teams and guests in mind"". A spokesperson said: ""We've spent the time since closure developing new processes to ensure we can reopen carefully and responsibly, which we've now started to do. ""We also saw the impact the situation is having on those who may not be able to easily get to the supermarkets, like key workers. There's a need for affordable, accessible food and we wanted to do our part."" The spokesperson added that furloughed staff would find their jobs ""waiting for them when we are able to fully reopen"". Sandwich volunteers Pret a Manger will reopen 10 shop kitchens near London hospitals from Thursday. ""This allows us to also get our supply chain up and running to donate food to homeless charities, so we will be donating 7,000 additional meals per week to our homeless charity partners,"" the chain said in a statement. NHS workers will get half-price food until the end of April. Pret's chief executive officer Pano Christou wrote in a blog post that NHS workers and hospitals want to be able to get ""freshly made food nearby"". ""We are incredibly grateful that 160 team members have volunteered to help reopen 10 shops in London, located close to hospitals."" More restaurants delivering Food delivery firm Deliveroo has raised more than £1.5m from customer donations and corporate funding for free meals for NHS workers. While the business declined to reveal overall order volumes, it said 3,000 new restaurants had signed up in March. A report in the Financial Times in March suggested that delivery apps could be feeling the pinch due to restaurant closures and as coronavirus anxiety continues. However, Deliveroo said it is seeing more orders from families, especially on Friday and Saturday nights. The majority of dishes it delivers are pizza, fish and chips, and burgers, it said. It added that it had also started to deliver food from stores including Morrisons, McColls, M&S and BP service stations. Rival delivery firm Just Eat also said that about 3,000 takeaways had signed up since the lockdown was announced. The firm has seen a 36% rise in orders for desserts, and said customers are ordering food earlier in the day, and earlier in the week. Health warning While fast food is very popular in the UK, there have been warnings about its effects on people's health for a number of years. In February, BBC One documentary ""The Truth About Takeaways"" found that over two weeks of eating two fast food meals per day, participants gained body fat, which is a marker for increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Eating two takeaways per week ""is associated with increased body weight and various cardiovascular risk markers"", Dr Ian G Davies, Reader in Nutritional Science at Liverpool John Moores University, told the programme. In general, pizza has the highest salt, fat and energy density compared with other fast foods.",Three major takeaway chains in the UK have announced limited reopening programmes after closing during the coronavirus lockdown.
"It said much of output lost during lockdown had been recovered but the outlook remained ""unusually uncertain"". The UK is still in a deep recession, while Covid-19 infections are at their highest level since mid May. Citing the uncertainty, the Bank held interest rates at 0.1%, a historic low. It added that it would continue its monetary support for the economy, but stopped short of increasing its bond-buying programme or reducing interest rates further. What are interest rates? If you borrow money you usually have to pay a small fee set by the person lending to you. How high that fee - or interest rate - is depends on a ""base rate"" that is set by the Bank of England at meetings throughout the year. The rate determines how much banks have to pay to borrow money, and that has a knock-on effect on how much the bank charges consumers to borrow. When the economy is growing quickly the Bank tries to stop it overheating by raising interest rates, making it more expensive to borrow. When the economy is sluggish, cutting the Bank's base rate lowers the cost of borrowing and can encourage businesses and consumers to spend more. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rate policy, said previous projections of economic recovery were ""on the assumption of an immediate, orderly move to a comprehensive free trade agreement with the European Union on 1 January 2021"". Economic recovery would also depend on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, the MPC said. ""The recent increases in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the world, including the United Kingdom, have the potential to weigh further on economic activity, albeit probably on a lesser scale than seen earlier in the year,"" it said. No change from the Bank of England on record low interest rates, nor on its wider support for the economy. On the face of it, the economy is less weak than it expected even last month, but profound uncertainties remain. The Bank in particular pointed to ""recent increases in Covid-19"", including in the UK, that ""have the potential to weigh further on economic activity"", as well as a recent fall in sterling partly ""reflecting recent Brexit developments"". Given rates are at rock bottom already, sterling was further hit from the fact that the Bank's deliberations over rates included a presentation over how ""negative interest rates"" might work. The Bank had been concerned of the impact of, in effect, lenders paying borrowers for the health of parts of the banking system. It is, as it has previously signalled, looking at how this could be achieved in practice. Should the uncertainties visible to all materialise in the coming weeks for the UK, that extraordinary and unprecedented tool is being prepared as an option. The government has had to impose new social distancing restrictions across England, as rising cases have forced many areas into local lockdowns. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister said the government was doing ""everything in our power"" to prevent another nationwide lockdown, which could have ""disastrous"" financial consequences for the UK. Negative rates The Bank of England said despite a stronger than expected recovery in the last few months, the economy was still about 7% smaller than at the end of last year. Usually if the economy is not growing strongly enough, the Bank of England considers lowering interest rates to encourage firms to invest and savers to spend. However, interest rates are already close to zero after two emergency rate cuts in March. Minutes from this month's meeting show that the MPC discussed the use of negative interest rates to stimulate the economy. Last month, the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, appeared to rule that out, though he said negative interest rates remained in the ""tool box"". If interest rates are negative the Bank of England charges for any deposits it holds on behalf of the banks. That encourages banks to lend the money to business rather than deposit it. The Bank also signalled that it had no intention of raising interest rates until ""significant progress"" had been made in getting inflation back to the Bank's 2% target. It is currently at a five-year low of 0.2%. The Bank said it did not expect inflation to return to target levels for another two years. ""We expect interest rates to be no higher than 0.1% for the next five years,"" said Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics.",The Bank of England has warned that the rising rate of coronavirus infections and a lack of clarity over the UK's future trade relationship with the EU could threaten the economic recovery.
"By Jessica MurphyBBC News, Toronto The then 28-year-old had no previous experience of working in the world of giant water slides and swimming pools, but he thought it would be more fun than continuing to work as an accountant. So he decided to build his own. Geoff had previously spent five years employed by the auditing firm KPMG Canada, until one day he came across the country's first water park in the western province of British Columbia. He was sent there on a work assignment, and he was immediately intrigued. ""It had some basic component that I thought was hugely fun,"" says Geoff. ""How good would it be to spend your life putting smiles on families' faces?"" So, inspired, he decided to quit the day job, take a leap of faith, and open Canada's second water park. Joining with a business partner, he found 18 acres of land in the city of Penticton, British Columbia, and constructed one. Fast forward 40 years, and Geoff's business - Whitewater West - is today the world's largest designer and manufacturer of water parks. When he opened that first park back in 1980, Geoff says it was ""very much house is on the line, savings on the line - modest as they were"". He adds: ""In reflection, the only thing more naïve than myself was the Royal Bank of Canada [who gave us the money]."" At the time, the water parks industry was in its infancy, with the first modern attraction opening in Florida in 1977. So Geoff couldn't simply buy in slides, or even follow some already drawn up plans. Instead he had to design and build his park from scratch, working with an engineering firm to create everything. During the park's inaugural summer, something fortuitous happened. ""Four [separate] fellows came by and said 'Gee, I'd like to do that in my home town. How'd you do it?'"" he says. Geoff ended up signing contracts to build four new parks, three in Canada and one in Washington State, in the US. Launching his new endeavour he had soothed his stress with the thought that, if the venture failed miserably, he always had accounting to fall back on. But riding that first wave of success, he says that he has ""frankly never looking back"". Three years after his park opened, he sold it, divesting completely from park ownership and operations, to instead focus on waterslide and pool design, engineering, manufacturing, and delivery. Today, Whitewater has 600 employees around the world, and projects across six continents, from Russia to India, Brazil to the US, and Australia to South Africa. With annual sales of $200m (£116m), the firm works with everyone from hotels, to amusement park behemoths like Disney, for whom it designed the vast Typhoon Lagoon wave pool in Orlando, Florida. ""We're the big boys in the industry - we're the gorillas in the living room, for sure,"" says Geoff. The water parks industry has boomed over the decades, with 30.9 million visiting the top 20 water parks in the world alone in 2018, according to sector-wide figures. To try to stay ahead of the curve in an industry always seeking bigger thrills and fresh experiences, Geoff says that the company focuses on innovation. Teams of designers, architects and engineers work at its headquarters in Vancouver, alongside artists and sculptors, to create the next most popular water slides, and other aqueous attractions. While some of Whitewater's North American rivals have not expanded outside of the US and Canada, Geoff says that he was always keen to build a truly global presence. Paths to Success More from the BBC's Paths to Success mini-series: He credits the time he spent in France as a teenager - he attended the American School of Paris from 1966 to 1969 - with making him see the world ""an awful lot smaller"", and that ""it's your oyster"". So he was always keen to explore the possibilities of expanding the company worldwide. ""We saw our competition - North American-based - afraid to venture out,"" he says. ""So we went to Asia, we went to Europe."" On occasions, he says the company was warned by sceptics that water parks just wouldn't work in some countries. In Japan, for example, where Whitewater opened its first overseas project in 1988, there were concerns that Japanese women would be too worried about sun exposure to embrace a water park. ""Yet to this day our number one attendance day was 68,000 in a park in Tokyo, completely blowing up that theory,"" he says. The business was also told that modesty concerns would get in the way of any success in the Middle East, but Geoff says that women-only events at a park in Dubai are a hit. ""A lot of cultures we've gone into, we've been told 'Nice idea, but you're going to fail there',"" says Geoff. ""[Yet], those components of water, sun, family, friends - they're very powerful when they're together."" The firm now has regional offices in Barcelona, Dubai, and Shanghai, and manufacturing operations in Turkey, the Philippines and Canada. David Sangree, present of consulting firm Hotel & Leisure Advisors, says that Geoff's stewardship of Whitewater has been ""impressive"". Turning his attention to the wider water park industry, Mr Sangree says that it is expected to only continue to grow, especially in Africa and parts of Asia where the market is not fully developed. ""You have a growing middle-class worldwide, people love to spend time with their children worldwide, and water parks are certainly a fun alternative,"" adds Mr Sangree. Back at Whitewater's headquarters, Geoff is particularly excited about developing and building surf pools. ""I think it's going to be huge fun to be able to say, surf in Saskatoon, surf in Toronto, and have world-class waves [miles from the ocean],"" he says. It does sound more enjoyable than being an accountant.","In 1980 Geoff Chutter found himself ""mortgaged to the underside of the nostrils"", and the owner of a brand new water park."
"By Kamal AhmedEconomics editor For Britain it is a different story. Today the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) downgraded growth forecasts for the next four years. And it has been more aggressive with those downgrades than the Bank of England was in its Inflation Report earlier in the month. The productivity problem is at the heart of that judgement. The UK just hasn't been very good at producing wealth for every hour worked, and today the OBR lowered its expectations about how fast productivity will recover. Which means that tax receipts will suffer, by up to £20bn a year by 2023. Add to that the increase in inflation following the Brexit referendum and the squeeze in real incomes and the OBR is clear - the economy is not as strong as it thought it would be. The chancellor's response has been two-fold. First, he has tried to paint a positive vision of Britain's future He has talked of the good record on employment. And, in the short term, the news on borrowing is better as tax revenues have been higher and public spending lower. Second, he has significantly loosened the fiscal tight belt he had thrown around the economy. In March, Mr Hammond planned for two years of higher spending - giveaways - followed by three years of tax rises - takeaways. Now he has said that borrowing will be higher for every year of the five-year forecast, and higher spending will last until 2023. Many economists will welcome such a move, the government doing more to stimulate the economy. The chancellor has pledged more money for health, a stamp duty tax cut and £3bn to prepare for leaving the European Union. But debt will continue to rise, and that means the cost of servicing the amount the government borrows will increase. Much of the government's debt is index linked - so its cost rises if inflation goes up. And every time the Bank of England increases interest rates, that also increases the cost of repaying the government's bills. The worry in the Treasury is that they have used up a good deal of the public finances headroom Mr Hammond wanted to build up for the future in case Brexit uncertainty around the economy crystalizes into another growth downgrade. The question now is what will happen if he needs to find more funding and still hit his target to balance the government's books by the middle of the next decade. And of course very little in this Budget will affect the key economic headwind everyone is facing. And that is the fall in real incomes.",Much of the rest of the world is growing at a healthier clip.
"The Markit/CIPS manufacturing purchasing managers' index, the first to have full data since the UK's vote to leave the EU, showed a fall to 48.2, the lowest since February 2013. The survey adds to concerns that the vote prompted a sharp fall in activity. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, but below 50 indicates contraction. The decline was sharper than an initial reading of 49.1 indicated late last month. The Markit/CIPS manufacturing index is based on a survey of 600 industrial companies and reflects data on orders, output, employment, suppliers' delivery times and companies' inventories. Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit, said the survey came ""amid increasingly widespread reports that business activity has been adversely affected by the EU referendum"". He added: ""The downturn was felt across industry, with output scaled back across firms of all sizes and across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors, although exporters did report a boost from the weaker pound."" 'Little consolation' Figures released last week showed the UK economy grew by 0.6% in the three months to the end of June. However, by far the strongest growth was in April, followed by a sharp easing off in May and June. Commenting on the Markit data, Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""There was little consolation from the detail of July's survey. Output contracted across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sectors. ""Employment in manufacturing declined for the seventh month in succession and input-price inflation rose to a five-year high off the back of sterling's weakness and higher commodity prices. ""The one bright spot was a rise in export orders, no doubt helped by the decline in the pound."" In another survey published on Monday, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) said business confidence had fallen in the wake of the referendum. Its business confidence index had been at minus 0.7 in the month running up to the vote, but dropped to minus 27.7 in the period from 24 June to 20 July. The latest economic data comes as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) prepares to issue its latest interest rate-setting decision on Thursday. The MPC had been widely expected to cut interest rates last month, but unexpectedly left them unchanged. This time, rates are likely to fall from 0.5% to a new low of 0.25%, analysts predict.","Activity among UK manufacturers contracted at its fastest pace for three years in July, according to a closely watched survey."
"Bright Food will take a 60% stake in Weetabix in a deal that values the company at £1.2bn. The Northamptonshire-based firm was family-owned until 2004, when it was bought by Lion Capital. Weetabix says its trademark breakfast cereal accounts for 7% of UK cereal sales, with annual sales of £101m. Bright Food chairman Zongnan Wang said: ""With Bright Food's strong resources and our expertise in both the Chinese and broader international markets, we are excellently placed to develop the Weetabix business."" The deal is the largest done by a Chinese company in the food and drink businesses. In 2011, Bright Food had revenues of $12.2bn.","China's Bright Food has bought a controlling stake in Weetabix, which owns the breakfast cereal brand as well as Alpen and Ready Brek."
"By Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent But the 32-year-old says he's still closely connected to the country, which is why he's pledged his life savings to fund the relief mission in India. He lost an extended family member to Covid in India recently. That personal tragedy also convinced him that he needed to step in to help. ""It is a bond that cannot be broken,"" he said, quoting from a well known Bollywood song that references the emotional ties overseas Indians feel towards the country of their origin. Mr Velagapudi is donating $5,000 a day until his savings run out to various aid missions in India, including AID India. ""I don't care if I go bankrupt,"" Mr Velagapudi said. ""People need to understand how dire the situation is."" That sentiment has prompted tens of millions of dollars worth of aid coming in from all corners of the world this week, mainly from the Indian diaspora. 'Every one of us has family there' Some of the biggest names in the Indian diaspora have pitched in including Google boss Sundar Pichai, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, and Silicon Valley investor and billionaire Vinod Khosla. ""We are getting requests from all over India, mainly from Delhi, looking for oxygen, PPE, drugs, ventilators, anything you might need in a hospital right now,"" Harjit Gill, chief executive of APACMED, a regional healthcare trade association based in Singapore, told the BBC. Ms Gill is of Indian origin and a British citizen. She added that help was coming from all quarters because almost no one of Indian descent has been untouched by this. ""Everybody is heartbroken. Every one of us has family there. We just want to find a way to help."" The Indian diaspora is one of the largest in the world, with almost 20 million people of Indian origin spread out across the world. It is a close-knit community, one that maintains strong present day ties to a country many left decades ago, in search of better prospects elsewhere. Stepping up Devika Mehndiratta is an Indian economist living in Singapore. This week she has had to deal with the deaths of two loved ones in her extended family back home in India. She thinks the Indian central government's lack of planning and its lax attitude is to blame for the severity of the second wave of rising Covid deaths. ""This isn't just about the number of cases increasing,"" she said. ""It is about people dying because of a lack of something as basic as oxygen."" She added that the central government chose to focus on gathering crowds at massive rallies to win the West Bengal election, and turned a blind eye to risky religious events such as the Kumbh Mela instead of paying attention to red flags as early as February on oxygen shortages at hospitals. ""People have literally been left to fend for themselves to stay alive. That's why the private sector has had to step up."" India's health minister has defended the government, saying the country's fatality rate was the lowest in the world and that oxygen supplies are ""adequate"". Private companies to the rescue Domestic firms based in India have sought to help. India's leading private steel firm JSW Group is lowering the production of steel at its plants so it can divert oxygen supplies to patients. In a statement to the BBC, the company said that it was building large Covid centres on an emergency basis around its plants, where JSW is laying a dedicated pipeline to supply oxygen directly to the patients. Other firms like the Tata Group, Reliance and Delivhery have also stepped in. ""India's healthcare is vastly under resourced and this is a long term, long running issue,"" Pavithra Suryanarayan, political scientist at John's Hopkin University, told the BBC. Ms Suryanarayan says a co-ordinated global approach to India's crisis is necessary. ""This has to be a global effort. If you let India go through this alone, you are going to let the virus come back to bite you. ""You can throw money at it, but you cannot build health capacity overnight. ""Even finding sufficient oxygen or ramping vaccine production will take a few weeks. Until then there are very dark days ahead for India.""","Singapore based start-up consultant Saurya Velagapudi hasn't lived in India since he was eight years old, when he and his family emigrated for a new life in the United States."
"By Katy AustinBusiness correspondent The think tank concludes one in eight private renters have fallen behind with housing costs since the coronavirus crisis began, compared to one in 12 mortgaged home owners. Its report is based on a YouGov survey of around 6,000 adults in the UK. The government says it took action to support renters during the pandemic. The action, which the government calls ""unprecedented"" includes banning evictions for three months and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. Lindsay Judge, principal policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said renters tended to be in a weaker financial position going into the crisis. ""They had lower levels of savings for example, and they spent considerably more of their income on housing costs in the first place. It's also fair to say home owners have been more successful at directly reducing their housing costs, so we've seen many more home owners issued a mortgage holiday than renters are being given reductions in rent."" 'A looming crisis' The Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee has warned ""there is a looming crisis in the private rental sector"", with thousands of tenants unable to pay their rent having lost their jobs or seen a significant loss of income. The committee's chair, Labour MP Clive Betts, told the BBC the UK was currently in ""the lull before the storm."" Citizens Advice has estimated that around 2.6 million tenants expect to fall behind on their rent because of coronavirus. Its principal policy manager Joe Lane warned renters are now facing a countdown to the end of protection from eviction. ""What we want the government to do is make sure there are protections for people who have fallen into arrears due to coronavirus, and also take steps to make sure landlords have to put in place things like affordable repayment plans and make sure the requirement to work with renters has some teeth."" 'Inundated' The housing charity Shelter said its emergency helpline has been inundated with calls from distressed renters who have lost their jobs and are terrified of losing their homes. Dennie Smith has been renting her family home for five years. She says that until the pandemic came along, she had never missed a payment. The £1,950 monthly rent has been a struggle since her husband lost his job last autumn. Then her South Croydon hair salon Vintage 62 had to close in late March because of the Covid-19 shutdown, meaning a sudden loss of income. Dennie says her landlord agreed she could postpone two months' rent, but she will still need to pay back the arrears in future. ""We managed to pay March but at the moment we owe April and May, and then June is due on Monday. I feel sick actually, because at the moment that's one of our biggest outgoings, the rent."" Her husband is about to start a new job, but will have a lower salary than before. She hopes her business is able to re-open as soon as possible and that customers do come back quickly. Knock-on effect But landlords are also feeling the knock-on effects. The National Residential Landlords' Association (NRLA) says that due to the virus, 54% of its members have experienced some combination of rent payment problems or unanticipated periods when properties are empty. Buy-to-let landlords are eligible for three-month mortgage holidays. The NRLA says this is helping to sustain tenancies, but means a cost further down the line. Sussex-based landlady Sue Hull has eight properties. One set of tenants, a couple who work full-time, had to self-isolate after their child displayed Covid-19 symptoms. Sue was sympathetic when they said how much they received in statutory sick-pay would affect their ability to pay rent, so she agreed to defer payments for two months, to be paid back over two years. Sue does not want to apply for a mortgage holiday from a buy-to-let lender because she fears it would affect how lenders perceive her situation when she tries to re-mortgage two other properties. ""I've also got another property that's empty I'm paying council tax on"" she says. ""Presently I'm having to take £600 pounds a month from my own savings. So it is not something I want to sustain in the long term"". Ben Beadle, chief executive at the NRLA said landlords are nervous. ""A number of our members are having issues that arose pre-Covid and not able to get possession of their property. With any sort of ban - we don't see that as being a long-term solution. We think a careful re-opening of evictions needs to take place that prioritises pre-Covid debt, anti-social behaviour and prioritises domestic violence."" The NRLA wants to see existing support extended to help tenants cover their costs, including the elimination of the five week waiting time for Universal Credit. Clive Betts said that although the government was considering a ""Pre-Action Protocol"" encouraging landlords to reach out to private tenants to understand their position before taking court action, this would only be worthwhile if the courts had discretion to make sure an attempt had been made to reach an agreement with their tenants. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We've taken unprecedented action to support renters and landlords during the pandemic - including banning evictions and increasing Local Housing Allowance (LHA) - and we've always said we will keep this under review. ""To help prevent people getting into financial hardship or rent arrears, we've given support for business to pay staff salaries and strengthened the welfare safety-net. ""Our guidance to landlords and tenants is clear they should work together to address any concerns and find solutions to overcome rent arrears, such as an affordable repayment programme."" Advice for struggling tenants Citizens Advice said people who are struggling to pay their rent should get in touch with their landlord and try to negotiate a reduction. They should also try to arrange for any arrears to be paid back over a manageable period and keep a note of discussions. The organisation also suggested exploring options for increasing income - for instance, making claims for benefits or other financial support introduced by the government to help ease the financial impact of the pandemic. The government has paused eviction proceedings until 25 June and has also temporarily extended notice periods for some tenancy types to three months. It is not yet clear what, if any, alternative measures will be put in place post 25 June.","Private renters are more likely to be struggling with payments than those who own their homes, new research by the Resolution Foundation suggests."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Since April 2016, anyone buying a buy-to-let property or a second home has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. Some 71,100 loans were advanced for house purchases by landlords in the year since the tax change, the Council of Mortgage Lenders figures show. This compares with 142,100 loans in the previous 12 months. 'Attractive deals' Since April 2016, landlords have faced a 3% surcharge on stamp duty - or Land and Buildings Transaction Tax in Scotland - if they already owned another property. There have also been changes to what landlords can claim in tax relief. Simon Bennett, a landlord from Belfast with 35 properties, said the extra tax only affected some purchases, but was coupled with banks being very reluctant to lend. ""They had their fingers burnt before, so they are not lending,"" the 40-year-old said. There was a big spike in mortgage lending for house purchases in the buy-to-let sector in March 2016, followed by a significant drop off. The latest figures are the first indication of the first full year since the tax change was made. Landlord house purchases have stayed low but first-time buyer mortgages have started to pick up. The CML expects this trend to continue. ""As we head into the summer, both first-time buyer and remortgage lending [are] expected to maintain momentum in the light of the very attractive deals currently available,"" said Paul Smee, director general of the CML. However, first-time buyers still face significant challenges, not least strict affordability rules and a requirement to find thousands of pounds for a deposit. Despite competition between lenders pushing down mortgage rates to record lows, existing owners are also facing pressures from rising clothing and energy prices. The UK's inflation rate rose last month to its highest since September 2013, at 2.7%. Following a survey by mortgage lender L&C Mortgages, it estimated that 2.5 million people have been forced to make significant cutbacks to reduce their spending in order to afford their mortgage payments. Where can I afford to live?","Mortgage activity in the UK buy-to-let sector has halved since the introduction of a stamp duty surcharge, figures show."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Asking prices in the capital for these top-of-the-ladder properties fell by 8.7% over the past year, according to search site Rightmove. House prices grew much faster in eastern England and the West Midlands than in London, according to Zoopla. London's annual house price growth for 2016 (3.7%) was below the UK average of 4.5% for the first time since 2008, the Nationwide Building Society says. So has the London bubble burst? Are bargains to be had? Well, these things are relative. One new development in Radstock Street in Battersea will see eight large apartments go on the market in February for £3.65m each. For most people around the UK, that is an eye-watering price for a three-bedroom property. Yet, the developers say these homes will be attractive to downsizers - people aged in their 50s and 60s already owning a home in central London. The idea of downsizing to a £3m-plus home might make those eyes water a little more, but Louisa Brodie, head of search at Banda Property, says these apartments are ""realistically priced"". ""They have car parking, a porter, and are brand new. Properties like this are rare to find, and areas like this have a unique selling point,"" she says. ""London is still one of the most desirable places to live, anywhere."" This is surely a sign that London property has been decoupled from the rest of the country for many years. Despite the drop in activity in London, the average house price in the capital is still £474,000, more than double the typical price of £217,000 in the UK as a whole, according to the latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The slowdown in central London is the result of the most significant change in the housing market in 2016 - a stamp duty surcharge on buy-to-let and second homes. Since April, anyone buying a home that is not their main residence has had to pay a 3% stamp duty surcharge. This meant that, for second homes or buy-to-let properties, the rate for properties priced at more than £1.5m reaches 15%. The surcharge led to a burst of activity in March followed by a steep drop in transactions in April - a ""hangover"" that still persists, according to Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics). In Scotland, the equivalent tax - the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - was also up-rated. Price changes The new surcharge, alongside a rise in normal stamp duty costs for £1m-plus homes since 2014, had a bigger impact on the market than the Brexit vote in June, according to experts. Ray Boulger, of John Charcol mortgage brokers, says it led to many at the expensive end of the market choosing to extend their homes rather than move. This made it more difficult to create chains lower down the market. Ed Stansfield, chief property economist at Capital Economics, says the housing market recovered ""remarkably quickly"" after cooling immediately after the UK's vote to leave the EU. He says a ""degree of nerves"" surrounding the economy and potential buyers' caution over stretching too far financially had kept a lid on house prices. Another major factor in the market over the last 12 months, according to the experts, is a lack of homes going on to the market. This supply squeeze has meant that, despite all the other pressures on affordability, prices continued to increase. The constraint on supply proved to be more problematic than expected, according to Mr Rubinsohn of Rics, whose prediction of a 6% rise in house prices for 2016 looks to be the most accurate. This trend will continue, he says, spelling more difficulties for first-time buyers whose incomes may fall in real terms. Many will continue to rely on the Bank of Mum and Dad for help with raising a mortgage deposit, while others will look to the government's Help to Buy projects to find somewhere affordable. UK house price forecasts for 2017 Others see first-time buyers as key to the buoyancy of the housing market. ""First-time buyers still underpin the wider market. So long as the government continues to support them either directly via Help to Buy or by further tax changes then the market should not plunge but this is not completely in the gift of politicians who frankly have more pressing matters to attend to,"" says property buying agent Henry Pryor. ""Like last year if you already own a home then you are probably better off than someone who doesn't. If you don't, then it seems unlikely that 2017 will see a swift solution emerge."" The experts have a relatively wide spread of predictions for 2017 - from price falls overall to rises matching or outstripping the general level of inflation. Martin Ellis, housing economist at mortgage lender the Halifax, is offering a hedge-your-bets prediction of between a 1% and 4% rise. ""The relatively wide range for the forecast reflects the higher-than-normal degree of uncertainty regarding the prospects for the UK economy next year,"" he says. Given that a buying a home is the biggest financial transaction of most people's lives, they - and their mortgage lender - will want some certainty over their job and income before taking the plunge. Where can I afford to live?",Buyers of a four-bedroom family home in London need deep pockets - but perhaps not as cavernous as a year ago.
"The chain is hoping that the price tag of £20 is low enough to win back some of the business lost in the pandemic. But city centres, saturated with coffee shops, remain relatively deserted as many office workers continue to work from home. Pret has already announced it is closing 30 outlets and laying off a third of its staff. Pret boss Pano Christou told the BBC's Today programme: ""There's no doubt that workers will come into the office less often than beforehand. Pret needs to adapt itself to the changes of customer patterns and that's where we've been very focused."" Although many of the sandwich chain's outlets are in central London, Mr Christou said that 40% of its business was in London suburbs and the home counties, where customers were starting to return ""much more swiftly"". He added that Pret had seen its delivery business grow tenfold through the coronavirus crisis. New strategy The coffee and sandwich chain is launching YourPret Barista next week as part of new digital strategy which it hopes will help revive its fortunes. Briony Raven, Pret's director of coffee and packaging, said the scheme aimed to help persuade customers to see Pret as the default choice, in the same way they do other subscription services such as Netflix. ""It's Pret's way of doing loyalty,"" she said. ""It's about giving people an easy choice, when they come back into their everyday routine."" For the fixed monthly fee a customer can select any ""barista prepared"" drink from a skinny soya latte to a smoothie, using their phone to access the subscription, up to five times a day, seven days a week. To prevent misuse by anyone planning to get in a round of coffees for their friends and colleagues, each drink must be collected 30 minutes apart. 'Revolutionary' scheme Consumer expert Kate Hardcastle said the £20 fee, with a month's free introductory trial, was an ""impressively low-ball offer"", illustrating how desperate retailers are to win people back and build loyalty. ""There has been a significant rise in subscription models over lockdown, everything from socks to gin, so people are into the idea,"" she said. ""But it's not going to be easy to translate to the coffee shop. What was once the daily latte is now interrupted. It may be that trips to the office are only once or twice a week rather than daily. Consumers are also well aware there could be regional lockdowns, which may mean they don't want to commit big amounts upfront."" The scheme appears to be designed around the ""new normal"", at a price that is still attractive even if you're only going to the office twice a week, said Natalie Berg an analyst with NBK retail. ""Pret is betting you'll buy a sandwich with that coffee and it becomes habitual,"" she said. ""Once you become a member of any subscription you want to get value so you use it more, spend more. So if you are a member, it's unlikely you'll go into Starbucks."" The scheme is ""revolutionary"", Ms Berg added, and shows the firm has recognised it needs to be creative in the current circumstances. As well as tempting people back in-store, it paves the way for Pret to offer a range of other services via the new digital platform, allowing it to engage with customers more personally and tailor services according to their spending habits. Pret said it had a number of other innovations in the pipeline, including extending its evening meal offer and deliveries. It has also started selling Pret-branded coffee on Amazon.

"Lloyds Banking Group said the faults were not caused by any external upgrade work or cyber attack. Many customers found their debit cards were declined and about 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours. The technical fault has now been fixed, and the banking group has apologised to those affected. Apology The hardware failure came on a normal day for the banking group, it said. ""We were in 'business as usual' mode - and there was no maintenance or update activity on the system at the time,"" said a spokeswoman for Lloyds. ""We are working with our suppliers to understand what caused the hardware failure, but there is no evidence that it was as a result of an external intervention or attack on our systems. ""We continually review and update our systems as necessary and make significant investment to do this."" The chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester, said on Sunday that its customers' debit card transactions had been affected after problems with two out of seven IT servers. He tweeted an apology and replied to some comments personally. Lloyds Banking Group serves about 30 million customers and is the largest retail banking group in the UK. TSB has about five million UK customers and is in the process of being split from Lloyds Banking Group. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, said it had been in contact with Lloyds and would be updated on how customers had been affected. Not everyone who tried to use their cards suffered problems, and Lloyds said that online customers were unaffected. Faults UK banks have suffered a series of IT problems over the past few years. In December, an estimated 750,000 customers at the Royal Bank of Scotland group were unable to use their credit and debit cards for several hours. A week later, NatWest - which is part of the group - said that it was hit by a cyber attack. A deliberate attempt to disrupt services by creating a surge in traffic - known as a distributed denial of service attack - meant some customers struggled to access online banking. In 2012, a major IT failure locked many RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers out of their accounts for several days. The issue was particularly bad for Ulster Bank, with customers facing access problems for weeks. Most banks have seen online and card failures in recent years, with many of the computer systems being used dating back decades. TechUK, a trade body for a number of technology companies, said: ""It is now widely acknowledged that the technology infrastructure across many financial institutions is exceptionally complex, to the point where it no longer serves many banks, it hinders them. ""However many financial institutions are unable to address these issues because of the sheer cost and disruption that replacing these systems would entail.""","A hardware failure was the cause of the shutdown of some Halifax, Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB cash machines and debit cards on Sunday."
"By Michelle FleuryBBC business correspondent, New York Judy and Richard Gassman live in the well-to-do neighbourhood Adams Farm, in Greensboro, North Carolina. Richard, an electrical engineer with a masters degree lost a well paid job two years ago. He hasn't been able to find work since. ""We're in debt right now and we're going to be in debt until I find a job,"" explains Richard. ""I'm not paying health insurance. Don't have it. Lost it when I lost my job."" And that's not all that's gone. Sifting through their possessions, they're preparing to leave the house they've called home for 17 years. They're being evicted. ""You know I never thought I'd lose my home in this way,"" says Judy. ""We grew up very family orientated so it's bittersweet."" Richard recently had a second interview for a job but hasn't heard anything. ""It's been long enough that I'm beginning to wonder."" The downward spiral in the Gassman's finances has left them in a precarious position. Their situation comes at a time of growing concern about income inequality and its effect on America's shrinking middle class. Winner takes all For much of the last century, the US was built on the idea that economic gains should be widely shared. America is supposed to be the land of opportunity. But Alan Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, believes things started to change in the 1980s. ""We are increasingly becoming a winner-take-all economy,"" Mr Krueger said in a speech recently. ""Over recent decades, technological change, globalisation and an erosion of the institutions and practices that support shared prosperity in the US have put the middle class under increasing stress."" For the past three decades, the wealthiest Americans have seen their incomes rise much faster than those in the middle. This change is not unique to the US. The picture is similar in the UK, France and Sweden but it is most dramatic in the US. With income inequality rising, there has been a renewed push to resuscitate America's declining manufacturing industry. The United States lost more than five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2010. Put another way, that amounts to nearly a third of manufacturing employment. President Obama has pinned a lot of hope on the return of manufacturing to help rebuild America's middle class. After years of jobs being shipped overseas, there are signs that some are coming back. Factory return Chinese computer maker Lenovo recently celebrated the opening of its first US manufacturing plant in Whitsett, North Carolina. Other companies like Motorola and Apple have also announced plans to manufacture in the US. At the opening ceremony, the words of Tom Looney, vice-president and general manager for Lenovo North America, were greeted with applause: ""We're here to celebrate the return of PC manufacturing back to the US,"" he said. ""And it's starting right here in the great state of North Carolina."" As wages went up in China, they've fallen here. Lenovo officials say it's still cheaper to make computers overseas but this way they can be closer to their American customers. Margo Crisp couldn't be happier. She's one of 115 newly hired workers. ""My plant closed down in 2009 and I was excited when somebody told me about this,"" she says. She hasn't had a job in manufacturing since the car factory she worked at shut down several years ago. Losing ground But the jobs that workers like Margo are taking are different from those of the past. Along the production line employees put together one of Lenovo's hybrid computers, a mix of a tablet and a laptop nicknamed the Twist. Yet despite the posters on the wall proclaiming ""Made in America"", many of the parts are built overseas. There are other reasons why the manufacturing jobs that are returning aren't the same. The reality is there aren't a lot of middle income jobs for medium-to-low-skilled workers. John Crawford is the president of his local union who has worked in manufacturing for nearly two decades. He's witnessed first hand the impact of global trade on American jobs. His fear today is that temporary, low paying jobs are becoming the norm. ""Temp agencies have been booming here lately and if you look at these big corporations, they hire through a temp agency now. You don't usually go through the company to get a job. That's the difference between the generations."" Temporary jobs don't come with benefits such as healthcare or pensions. And often they don't pay enough to enable saving for things like house down-payments or children's education. In short, they don't provide many of the essential qualities of the American middle class experience. So it's no surprise that nearly three-in-five middle class Americans say they are concerned about falling out of their economic class, according to a recent poll. Back at the Lenovo factory, plant manager Jeffrey Benes patrols the assembly line. With customer orders rolling in, there's no shortage of work. ""For the first six months of this year we've had plenty of overtime."" The staff here are proud of what they're making, knowing that the products that leave here will bear an American flag. This is after all a country which still believes in the power of the middle class dream, even if in reality it's increasingly out of reach.","The middle class were once the engine of America but since the recession, many are struggling."
"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter It is an apt backdrop for the UK automotive sector's current predicament. ""Brexit has derailed the industry,"" says Sarwant Singh, senior partner and global head of automotive and transportation at consultants Frost & Sullivan. ""The uncertainty causes people not to buy cars."" The number of cars sold in the UK dropped 5.7% in 2017, according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders, and ratings agency Moody's predicts a further 5.5% fall this year. There has been little respite from foreign markets, with exports slipping 1% last year. Each year, about 80% of the vehicles built in the UK are exported, so smooth international trade relations are vital for the automotive sector's continued prosperity. But these days, the relations are as choppy as the sea in the Bristol Channel. Industry executives' main fear is that Brexit will result in heightened barriers to trade, not only with the European Union, but with the rest of the world too, once the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. The prospect of an escalating trade dispute between the US and its main trading partners, the EU and China, also looms large, after US President Donald Trump's recent threat to tax cars imported into the world's largest market. ""All of Europe is exposed,"" says Justin Cox, director of global production at consultants LMC Automotive, ""but some plants are more exposed than others, and it so happens that several of those are in the UK."" Then there's China, the world's second-largest car market. Trading relations with China are already complicated, and may well be subject to even greater complexity in future. ""A UK-China free trade agreement will be neither easy nor clearly advantageous for the UK,"" says Bruegel, a European think tank that specialises in economics. Part of the issue, it says, is that the UK would like to land better trade deals with China when it leaves the bloc than the ones the EU already has in place. But being smaller, the UK will be in a weaker position during trade talks, so there are no guarantees China will be prepared to offer better terms. On top of this, UK automotive trade with China - and other fast-growing markets such as India, Brazil and Russia - could suffer, depending on the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, Mr Singh says. That's because the UK might not be able to piggyback on the EU's existing bilateral trade agreements with third countries, including those entered into since the Brexit vote with Canada and Japan. Instead, it would face years of protracted trade talks with dozens of countries. Getting a good Brexit deal is also important because of the interdependence of European automotive companies. ""The motor industry has taken advantage of the EU's single market as much as, perhaps more than, any other industry,"" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of SMMT. As a result, EU customers buy about €15bn ($18.5bn; £13bn) worth of British-made cars per year, accounting for some 53% of the UK's vehicle exports, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). Conversely, EU manufacturers deliver 81% of the cars imported by the UK, to the tune of about €45bn, a trade imbalance that Brexit supporters hope will give the UK leverage during trade talks. At the same time, about 80% of the parts and components used to build cars in the UK are also imported from the EU, while 70% of the parts and components made in the UK are exported to EU countries. ""Any changes to the deep economic and regulatory integration between the EU and the UK will have an adverse impact on automobile manufacturers with operations in the EU and/or the UK, as well as on the European economy in general,"" the ACEA says. Hence, both the UK and the European car industries are keen to see a final UK-EU deal that retains frictionless trade in the long-term. ""Anything short of single market membership could be a problem for the UK,"" says Simon Dorris, managing partner at Lansdowne Consulting. Free trade is indeed key to future prosperity, not just within Europe but beyond, according to Prof Patrick Minford of Cardiff University, who chairs Economists for Free Trade, a group of pro-Brexit economists. Its much debated paper, From Project Fear to Project Prosperity, suggests fears of rising trade barriers for carmakers after Brexit are misplaced. Prime Minister Theresa May has said that Brexit presents an ""opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world"". ""Auto manufacturers will improve profitability post-Brexit,"" Prof Minford predicts. Motor vehicle production, 2017 Source: ACEA Despite the uncertainty about a future trade deal, a number of big carmakers have committed to building more cars in the UK since the Brexit vote, including Nissan, BMW, Toyota, and last week Vauxhall, which is owned by French group PSA. But Parliament's cross-party Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee is pessimistic, recently warning that ""there are no advantages to be gained from Brexit for the automotive industry for the foreseeable future"". The UK prime minister's desire for free trade is shared by the global motor industry more generally. Executives are nevertheless pragmatic, and accept that although international trade is governed by rules policed by the World Trade Organization, free trade is rarely a reality. Trade-distorting subsidies and a variety of measures, such as regulatory barriers, internal tax measures, and intellectual property rights, still impede the free flow of goods, even when trade agreements are in place, according to the European Commission. The EU, for instance, will not import cars unless they meet EU safety and emissions requirements. Moreover, trade agreements are generally conditional. For instance, cars exported from the EU must be predominantly made within the EU to be allowed free entry into other markets. Such ""Rules of Origin"" could complicate exports for UK carmakers after Brexit, as an estimated 55%-75% of the parts and components that make up a car built in Britain are imported, according to Mr Hawes of SMMT. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Whatever level of access UK-made cars get to markets around the world after Brexit, the manufacturers ultimately have to try ensure that their vehicles will be popular with overseas buyers. Mr Hawes says that this is not always easy, citing the fact that the UK's best-selling car is the compact Ford Fiesta, whereas the most popular vehicle in the US is the large Ford F150 pick-up truck. Consequently, there are reasons to question whether the US market is the most natural one to focus on for UK manufacturers, which tend to produce cars that suit British and European consumers, he observes. ""So it's also about producing the right car for the market,"" he says, pointing to how Honda is producing the Civic in Swindon for global markets. ""They have shown it can be done"".","A storm is brewing as clouds gather over Bristol Port, with the rain set to fall on tens of thousands of vehicles parked in the port's car compounds, ready for export by ship, or destined for UK dealerships."
"Shares in the 80%-taxpayer-owned bank dropped 3% on the news. RBS boss Ross McEwan said: ""The scale of the bad decisions during that period [the financial crisis] means that some problems are still just emerging."" RBS said its executive committee would not receive a bonus for 2013, Mr McEwan has waived his bonus for 2013-14. RBS said on Monday the £3.1bn it planned to set aside would be used to settle claims relating to mortgage products, PPI claims and interest rate hedging. Surprise It would allocate: RBS chairman Philip Hampton said: ""RBS did suffer more than most banks in the crisis and these charges today represent an extra clearing-up of the mess that was created in the bank in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2008."" The announcement of the new provisions came near the end of share dealing in London. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ""It's an absolutely shocking story that the British taxpayers are still paying for the excesses of this bank in the boom period before it collapsed."" Ian Gordon, from Investec Securities, said the news was not entirely unexpected, but the amounts involved were. ""Some of this is a pull forward of future bad news and some of this is additional,"" Mr Gordon said. ""Most of the items aren't surprising, but the amounts are at or above the top end of expectations."" The cumulative amount set aside to cover the mis-selling of PPI, payment protection insurance, alone, is now £3.1bn, said RBS. RBS, has also, in common with most of its rivals, been fined for fixing the key Libor interest rate and has suspended traders amid an investigation into alleged rigging of the foreign exchange markets. 'Repayment unlikely' The BBC learned earlier this month that general discussions about bonuses had taken place with shareholders, including UK Financial Investments, the body that manages the government's shareholding in the bank. But, in an interview with the BBC on Monday, RBS chief executive Ross McEwan explained why the most senior executives would not be receiving bonuses this year. ""This is about leadership,"" he said. ""When you look at what we're having to put aside for past activity regarding litigation and conduct, I said to the team, 'I am sorry, I just cannot justify the payment of a bonus.'"" He added most of the current leadership had nothing to do with past wrongdoing, but said they needed to ""set the standards"". But Mr McEwan said that when it came to paying 200% bonuses to attract and keep talented staff, ""We need to make sure that, whatever the market does, we are in a position to follow it. ""We are not the leaders on pay, we just need to stay within touching distance of those we have to compete with to get the talent."" The controversy over bank bonuses flared up in Parliament earlier this month, with Labour demanding Chancellor George Osborne block any attempt by RBS to pay bonuses of up to double its bankers' annual salary. In 2008, the government bailed out RBS with £46bn of public funds, and now owns just over 80% of the giant bank. Since then, the bank's share price has tumbled to less than one-third the price the government paid for it. There are questions over whether the government will be able to recoup that money. BBC business editor Robert Peston said that investors and politicians had told him they think it is unlikely taxpayers will get all their money back.","RBS may face full-year losses of up to £8bn, after the bank said it needed another £3.1bn for claims relating to the financial crisis."
"The company said the appointments were a ""first step"" in efforts to refresh and diversify its board. Shareholders are currently suing Wynn's board over claims it knew of the allegations against Mr Wynn for years and failed to investigate. Mr Wynn has denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations ""preposterous"". Wynn Resorts said Betsy Atkins, Dee Dee Myers and Wendy Webb had been appointed as independent directors, effective immediately, bringing its board numbers to 11. ""The Wynn Resorts board now comprises 36% women, bringing Wynn into the top 40 S&P 500 companies in terms of female board representation,"" the company said in a statement. Ms Myers was the first woman to serve as the White House press secretary, a position she held during President Clinton's first term and is now an executive at Warner Bros. Ms Webb's background includes some 20 years as a senior executive at The Walt Disney Company, while Betsy Atkins is an expert in corporate governance. ""To be clear, this is the first step in our effort to refresh the board,"" said chairman D Boone Wayson. ""We intend to add additional new directors in the coming months."" Mr Wynn resigned as head of the firm he co-founded in February after a Wall Street Journal report alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him. Since his resignation, all his stock in the firm has been sold and he has been removed from all company operations. He is one of the biggest names in the business world to quit over allegations of sexual misconduct. Wynn's board has launched an internal investigation into any awareness of the allegations and its response to the allegations regarding its former head. Wynn Resorts owns and operates several casino complexes including Wynn Macau, Wynn and Encore Las Vegas, and Wynn Palace Cotai.","Casino operator Wynn Resorts has added three women to its board, amid allegations of sexual misconduct by its former chief executive Steve Wynn."
"Intel will pay $63.54 a share in cash for the Israeli company, which develops ""autonomous driving"" systems. Mobileye and Intel are already working together, along with German carmaker BMW, to put 40 test vehicles on the road in the second half of this year. Intel expects the driverless market to be worth as much as $70bn by 2030. Jerusalem-based Mobileye has contracts with 27 car makers. It also controls about two thirds of the market for software that runs automatic emergency braking and semi-autonomous cruise control systems already fitted to cars and trucks. Technology companies are racing to launch driverless cars. Earlier this month, Nissan test drove a converted Leaf vehicle and said it hoped to make the cars available by 2020. Google has also done extensive development of driverless cars. Announcing the deal, Intel said that as cars ""progress from assisted driving to fully autonomous, they are increasingly becoming data centres on wheels"". The chipmaker reckons that by 2020 driverless cars will generate 4,000 GB, or 4 terabytes, of data a day that can be mined for information. Betsy Van Hees, analyst at Loop Capital Markets, said Intel had very little presence in the automotive market, ""so this is a tremendous opportunity for them to get into a market that has significant growth opportunities"". Timothy Carone, a Notre Dame University academic, said: ""Major players are finding ways finding ways to position themselves for a change as seminal as the personal computer revolution."" Shares in Intel fell 2.2% to $35.10 in New York. Mobileye was founded in 1999 to develop ""vision-based systems to improve on-road safety and reduce collisions"". The company, along with Intel's automated driving group, will be based in Israel and led by Amnon Shashua, Mobileye's co-founder, chairman and chief technology officer. In its results for last year, Mobileye said revenue more than tripled to $358m, while pre-tax profit jumped from $79.7m to $125.4m.",US chipmaker Intel is taking a big bet on driverless cars with a $15.3bn (£12.5bn) takeover of specialist Mobileye.
"The consumer gadget and computer maker reported $35bn in sales , up from $28.6bn in 2011. But sales of its iPod digital music player fell 10% while Mac computer sales flatlined, up just 2%. It will pay shareholders a rare dividend of $2.65 per share on 16 August. iPhone vs iPad Apple - the world's most valuable company - sold 26 million iPhones. That is a rise of 28% but slower growth than many analysts had forecast. By contrast, sales of Apple's tablet computer, the iPad, rose 84% from the same period last year. ""We're thrilled with record sales of 17 million iPads in the June quarter,"" said Apple's chief executive Tim Cook. But David Rolfe of Wedgewood Partners said: ""What is key is the mixture between iPhone and iPad, the iPhone has higher margins. iPhone sales were lower than expected - meaningfully lower - and that translates into a big hit on the bottom line."" Analysts had forecast third quarter revenue of $37.2bn, according to a Thomson Reuters poll. Apple's forecast for sales in the fourth quarter - the three months ending in September - was still lower at $34bn, which disappointed investors. Apple shares fell nearly 5% in after hours trading. Challenges ahead Like many US companies, the strength of the US dollar against the euro and other currencies makes US-made goods more expensive overseas. Added to that, the faltering economic recovery in the United States combined with recession in major markets such as Europe is also making it more difficult to sell consumer electronics. Apple also faces stiff competition from Samsung's Galaxy S3 and HTC's One X smartphones. ""European sales dipped by a very surprising 6%... The combination of Samsung's big roll-outs and suddenly weakening European consumer demand in June created some issues,"" said Tero Kuittinen of Alekstra. Apple is due to launch the iPhone 5 later this year but the group is under pressure to come up with a whole new generation of products to secure its position in the technology sector. ""We've also just updated the entire MacBook line, will release Mountain Lion [its new operating system, on Wednesday] and will be launching iOS 6 this fall. We are also really looking forward to the amazing new products we've got in the pipeline,"" said Mr Cook. Samsung rivalry Also on Tuesday, Apple told a US court it would seek damages of more than $2.5bn from South Korean rival Samsung. Apple claims Samsung copied iPhone and iPad designs, infringing Apple patents. Samsung has denied copying Apple's intellectual property and instead claims that Apple has been using Samsung patented technology for its wireless connections. Earlier this year, the court instructed the two technology giants to try to settle the matter out of court, but talks broke down after just two days in May. The court case gets underway in San Jose, California on Monday 30 July.","Apple made a net profit of $8.8bn (£5.7bn) in the three months ending in June, up 21% from a year earlier but lower than forecasts."
"The business, founded in 1905, has £2.65bn in debt and wants to raise funds. It is also considering staying with its current ownership and raising the money itself from shareholders. The AA has 2,700 roadside assistance patrol vehicles and also provides insurance and driving lessons. It said there was no certainty that any of the approaches would lead to an offer. The possible bidders are Platinum Equity Advisors, Warburg Pincus International, and a joint offer from Centerbridge Partners Europe and TowerBrook Capital Partners. The AA said it had traded ""resiliently"" throughout the Covid-19 crisis, and it expected its financial performance this year to be ""only slightly below"" that of its previous financial year. Motor insurance has performed well in recent months, as with fewer cars on the road there have been fewer claims. But the company says it is constrained by its debts. More than a third of its borrowing - £913m - is due for repayment in two years, the company said: ""Debt reduction is therefore a key priority and the group continues to... seek to reduce its indebtedness well ahead of the upcoming maturity dates."" The AA has been owned by private equity before, but the company was floated on the stock market in 2014. At their best five years ago, its shares rose to more than 400p, but they fallen since, hitting 15p at their lowest point in April this year. The news of the takeover approaches sent the AA's shares up 13% to 28p in early trading on Tuesday. AA chairman John Leach said: ""The AA is a high quality and robust business, with an iconic brand, a resilient business model and a highly committed and loyal workforce. ""However, in order for us to be able to achieve our full potential, the board believes that it must now prioritise reducing the group's indebtedness.""",The AA says it has received takeover approaches from three parties who are interested in buying the motoring group.
"They urged swift action after the first deadly 737 Max crash off Indonesia in October, according to audio obtained by CBS and the New York Times. Boeing reportedly resisted their calls but promised a software fix. But this had not been rolled out when an Ethiopian Airlines' 737 Max crashed four months later, killing 157 people. Currently 737 Max planes are grounded worldwide amid concerns that an anti-stall system may have contributed to both crashes. Boeing is in the process of updating the system, known as MCAS, but denies it was solely to blame for the disasters. In a closed door meeting with Boeing executives last November, which was secretly recorded, American Airlines' pilots can be heard expressing concerns about the safety of MCAS. Boeing vice-president Mike Sinnett told the pilots: ""No one has yet to conclude that the sole cause of this was this function on the airplane."" Later in the meeting, he added: ""The worst thing that can ever happen is a tragedy like this, and the even worse thing would be another one."" The pilots also complained they had not been told about MCAS, which was new to the 737 Max, until after the Lion Air crash off Indonesia, which killed 189. ""These guys didn't even know the damn system was on the airplane, nor did anybody else,"" said Mike Michaelis, head of safety for the pilots' union. Boeing declined to comment on the November meeting, saying: ""We are focused on working with pilots, airlines and global regulators to certify the updates on the Max and provide additional training and education to safely return the planes to flight."" American Airlines said it was ""confident that the impending software updates, along with the new training elements Boeing is developing for the Max, will lead to recertification of the aircraft soon."" Following the Lion Air crash, Boeing issued additional instructions to pilots in case they faced a malfunction of the MCAS. But in a letter obtained by the AFP news agency, Mr Michaelis said the instructions weren't sufficient to help pilots in the event of malfunction. Mr Michaelis also reportedly asked Boeing executives at the meeting to consider a software upgrade for the 737 MAX 8 - which probably would have required the planes be grounded for some time. The executives said they didn't want to rush out a fix, and said they expected pilots to be able to handle problems, according to the New York Times. Investigators believe in both deadly crashes a faulty sensor triggered the plane's MCAS anti-stall system, which repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down. Earlier this month Boeing admitted that it knew about another problem with its 737 Max jets a year before the fatal accidents, but took no action. The firm said it had inadvertently made an alarm feature optional instead of standard, but insisted that this did not jeopardise flight safety. The feature - an Angle of Attack (AOA) Disagree alert - was designed to let pilots know when two different sensors were reporting conflicting data. The US Federal Aviation Administration said the issue was ""low risk"", but said Boeing could have helped to ""eliminate possible confusion"" by letting it know earlier. Boeing has been working on a software fix for its flight system and is hoping for quick approval from regulators. But it is unclear if the planes will be back in the air before the end of the critical summer travel season.","American Airlines pilots confronted Boeing about potential safety issues in its 737 Max planes in a meeting last November, US media are reporting."
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent It reckons the recent pick-up has been pretty broad-based, particularly in Europe and Asia. Tax reforms in the United States are expected to stimulate economic activity, especially business investment. But the IMF has substantially downgraded its forecast for South Africa for this year and next. The new global forecast has growth of 3.9% this year and next. That represents an upgrade of 0.2% for each year. It also constitutes faster expansion than previous years (3.7% in 2017; 3.2% in 2016). The improvement is widespread. The report says 120 economies accounting for three-quarters of global economic activity saw a pick-up last year. Both developed and emerging economies were affected. That, the IMF says, is the broadest synchronised global growth upsurge since 2010. Indicators from business surveys suggest manufacturing activity will remain strong. Although the improved performance towards the end of last year was widespread, the report mentions Asia and Europe as having had ""notable"" positive surprises in growth. Looking ahead, the IMF expects the tax reforms agreed in the US last year to stimulate the country's economy. The main impact that the report envisages is on business investment, as a result of lower corporate taxes. The total cumulative effect up to 2020 is predicted to be 1.2%. The impact of the reforms on the US and its trading partners accounts for about half of the global growth revision for this year and next. But because some of the provisions in the tax reform are temporary, the IMF expects slower growth for a few years from 2022. But there was a warning from the IMF's chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, when he introduced the report at a news conference in Davos: ""The present economic momentum reflects a confluence of factors that is unlikely to last for long."" It's important, he argued, that governments take steps to address impediments to growth, to make it more inclusive and to make economies more resilient when the next downturn comes. There are a small number of forecasts that have been lowered for individual countries. US Senate struggles to end budget deadlock UK growth upgrade could 'dwarf' Brexit hit The largest negative change is for South Africa, particularly 2019, where the downgrade is 0.7%. There's a smaller reduction for his year. The changes reflect what the IMF calls increased political uncertainty weighing on confidence and investment. There is also a small (0.1%) downgrade for the UK in 2019. The report, which is an update between the IMF's full scale forecasting exercises, does not give a reason. It predicts UK growth of 1.5% this year and next. Within the G7 leading developed countries, that is better than Italy and Japan, but behind the other members of the group. The report notes the Brexit negotiations as one of a number of potential risks to the outlook. It is one example where long-standing international commercial agreements are under renegotiation. The IMF says an increase in trade barriers and regulatory realignments, if that were the result of these renegotiations, could weigh on global investment and reduce efficiency. The report warns that a failure to make growth more inclusive could increase pressures for what it calls ""inward-looking policies"" - by which the IMF means new trade barriers, which it regards as bad for economic growth.","Prospects for the global economy are looking brighter, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
"By Tim BowlerBusiness reporter, BBC News But what will the business mogul do when he takes office in January, and what will be the impact of his economic policies on the UK economy and British businesses? We asked a selection of chief executives, business leaders and financial analysts to tell the BBC how they see a Donald Trump presidency. Trump and trade: a radical agenda? Five questions on economy for Trump Trump's economic promises President Trump: All hat, now where are the cattle? Market meltdown fails to materialise Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive and founder, advertising agency WPP Effectively a second Brexit that leaves many very surprised, including the markets and me. It's going to take a significant amount of time to assess the implications beyond the short term. Increased levels of uncertainty will mean more hesitation to make important decisions in the short term, both by people and governments. But it may accelerate implementation of helpful reforms in the medium term to reduce uncertainty and stimulate investment as a result. Clearly immigration, trade and terrorism were key issues that swayed electoral opinion in a very significant way, just as they did in the UK, and probably will in the European referendums and elections to come. There will now be a lot of reassessment, including of polling techniques. Electorates at times like these clearly don't like to be told how they're going to vote, especially by the media and other elites. Iain Conn, chief executive, Centrica, owners of British Gas What is clear from this vote, and similarly the Brexit vote last June, is that while globalisation may have been on average good for the world, it has also left many people behind. We have to listen to this, and business, government and civil society will need to map a path forward together. The subject of social inequality is one shared by the UK and the US, and perhaps should be part of the agenda for the special relationship between our two countries. Terry Scuoler, chief executive, manufacturers' organisation EEF Given the importance of the United States as a market, taking around 12% of UK goods exports, British manufacturers have a keen interest in the health of the US economy. In the light of uncertainty around Brexit it is important that we avoid further economic fallout and I hope the new administration will move quickly to reassure and work with its traditional allies to re-affirm longstanding and positive relationships. Britain has always enjoyed a close political, economic and military relationship with the United States and it is vital that this continues. Given the United States' traditional role as a pioneer of free and fair trade, I hope the new President will ensure that he continues to champion this ethos."" Ben Digby, international director, Confederation of British Industry British business has been keeping a close eye on the race for the White House, and congratulates the President-elect. The UK is the largest foreign investor in America, and British companies support over a million jobs in the US, stretching from Alaska to New York. As the UK and the USA's economic special relationship continues to go from strength to strength, we hope that the President-elect is committed to building on, and developing, this unique political and trading partnership. Firms are keen to understand more about Mr Trump's trade policies. Following the UK's decision to leave the European Union, we need to do everything we can to make it easier to trade, invest and drive prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic. David Jane, fund manager, Miton Asset Management Donald Trump, and the Republicans controlling both the House and Senate, is the result that markets least expected. What we do know is that his policies will be broadly inflationary. Whether it is his protectionist policies, controlling immigration or investment in infrastructure, all point to a more inflationary tendency. Demand is likely to be higher for natural resources as a consequence of the infrastructure spend he is likely to make, although we doubt he will be building a wall between the US and Mexico. If he manages to introduce tariffs on certain imports, this will also lead to higher prices in the US. That said, it's not clear whether he will be able to implement such policies as the rest of his party are very pro-business and vested interests will be strongly against anything that damages US business interests. He also wants to control immigration, particularly illegal immigration. Clearly, the effect of immigration is to put downward pressure on wages, so it is also inflationary at the margin and in the longer term. As a populist he is certain to favour policies, in whatever area, that benefit the masses or at least are perceived to do so. While we doubt he is likely to be as populist as certain southern European or Latin American leaders of the past, we expect the tone to move in that direction.

"By Humphrey HawksleyBBC News, Nyabibwe, Democratic Republic of Congo Below him lies the opening of the Kilimbi Shaft at Nyabibwe mine. He turns on his headlamp and enters. Other miners follow through dripping water, their heads bent below the roof of the dark, narrow tunnel shored up by timber struts. At the rock face, Mr Yalala sets to work, hacking tin from the mountain with the most basic of tools. ""It's hard work,"" he says. ""We only use what we have - a torch, a hammer and a spike. We dug this tunnel with our own hands."" He has no helmet or gloves. The air is thick with dust. But at least down here there is no war and no violence. Conflict, slave and child labour In the heat outside, the dangers have at times been much greater than those inside the mines. This part of Africa has been blighted by ethnic wars for decades. Millions have died. Much of the violence has been financed with profits from the mining of metals such as tin, coltan, tantalum and gold - all used in electronic appliances. To this day, different militia often control the mines, selling the minerals into the global supply chain. Electronic companies, which can trace the origins of most of their materials, concede they cannot guarantee that their products are not tainted with conflict, slave or child labour. Fidel Bafilemba from the campaigning group the Enough Project says that is not good enough. ""It is not a case that the minerals could have come from here,"" he says. ""They do indeed come from here."" Global intervention Mr Bafilemba points to parts of a laptop, a mobile phone and a wi-fi router spread out on a table in front of him. They all contain the key minerals. He points to gold - a resilient conductor of electricity - which shows clearly in the connecting prongs of a laptop hard drive. ""Where the mineral should be a source of wealth and of wellbeing, it is a curse,"" he says. ""It is a source of death in this country and that's why everybody who's human should say: 'No, we're going to put an end to this.'"" That is exactly what might be happening. In the United States, a new law - section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank legislation - demands that any company that might be using conflict minerals register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In Europe, meanwhile, the 34-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been meeting to tighten guidelines on dealing with conflict minerals. The Nyabibwe mine and its community have become a test case - and it is hurting. Known locally as the Obama law, the Dodd-Frank legislation has prompted big American and European buyers of tin to pull out rather than register and be tainted by the stigma of conflict minerals. ""The price has gone down, and I haven't been paid,"" says Nambibwe tin trader Kubisibwa Shihi. ""We are having a price imposed on us that has nothing to do with the world price."" The company that owes Mr Shishi money is run by Cirimwami Benjamen, in the regional capital Bukavu. It is only about 50 miles away, but the roads here are appalling so it is a four-hour drive. In Mr Benjamen's run-down yard stand lines of blue drums filled with tin, waiting to be sold. ""The Americans just stopped buying,"" says Mr Benjamen. ""We have debts and we owe money. Now we've found a Chinese company that might buy our stock."" 'Boycott is working' Regulations drawn up thousands of miles away are having a dramatic effect on lives here. Albert Mulikuza, the Congolese government official pushing through the policy, concedes that ""people are suffering from the boycott"", but insists it is necessary. ""The time of war and suffering is now at the beginning of its end,"" he says. Mr Bafilemba, from the Enough Project, agrees. He describes the situation as a ""boycott that is working"". But the tin industry's own pressure group, ITRI, disagrees. ITRI says it does not ""generally support the imposition of trade restrictions"". And it insists that such measures are ""unlikely to modify the practices that are of concern and are likely to disadvantage those who the actions seek to protect"". Meanwhile, the London-based World Gold Council is working towards implementing a conflict-free gold standard. Damaged reputation The mine in Nyambibwe is one of the few that has been certified as ""green"", which means it is not controlled or owned by military or rebel armed groups, and there are no children working here. ""Be sure, this is a green mine,"" says miner Mr Yalala, like a salesman, his face caked with the grit of the mine shaft. ""You can see it is clean so people can come and start buying minerals from this mine again."" But will they? Technically, the transparency around the mine means tin extracted from it can legally enter the global supply chain. Yet even here in this mine, the miners are still working in conditions that many say are appalling. Elsewhere, many others, particularly those producing gold, are failing certification. The United Nations, Western governments and activists agree that much more has to be done to revive the damaged reputation of DR Congo's mineral wealth extraction.","High in the mountains in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Fidele Yalala, carrying his tools in a sack, climbs down a slippery steep hillside."

"The German airline has been severely affected by a decline in travel due to the coronavirus and closed its budget airline Germanwings in April. The German government will take a 20% stake in the firm, which it intends to sell by the end of 2023. But the deal still has to be approved by the firm's shareholders and the European Commission. As part of the rescue package, the German government will also inject €5.7bn in non-voting capital, which is known as a ""silent participation"". Part of these funds can be converted into an additional 5% equity stake, which would enable the government to veto any potential hostile takeover bids. European markets rose on the news, with Lufthansa shares closing 7.5% higher, while Germany's Dax jumped 2%. The Frankfurt-based index closed at its highest level since 6 March. The Cac 40 index in France meanwhile rose 1.5%, and the pan-European Euro Stoxx 50 climbed 1.1%. Global airlines group IATA has said it expects airline passenger revenues to drop by more than 40% this year and warned that more than 25 million jobs in aviation and related industries are at risk. ""The support that we're preparing here is for a limited period,"" said Germany's Finance Minister Olaf Scholz at a press conference on Monday. ""When the company is fit again, the state will sell its stake and hopefully ... with a small profit that puts us into a position to finance the many, many requirements which we have to meet now, not only at this company."" The bailout deal is the result of weeks of talks between Lufthansa and the German government about financial aid and will help save up to 10,000 jobs. The German government has set aside a fund of €100bn to help shore up companies struck down by the pandemic. The airline had previously been operationally healthy and profitable with good prospects, but had run into trouble because of the coronavirus lockdown measures implemented by governments across the world. Lufthansa decommissioned more than 40 aircraft in April and said it would look to offload aircraft in its other businesses, which include Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings. The airline had warned that it does not expect demand for air travel to return for ""years"". Lufthansa is not the only national carrier that has needed to be rescued. On Sunday, the French and Dutch governments pledged a lifeline of more than €11bn in loans and guarantees to support Air France-KLM. Lufthansa has the most passenger traffic in Europe, followed by Air France-KLM, according to aviation analysts, the Centre for Aviation. The UK government has indicated that it is preparing its own plan to rescue large British firms. Last week, the bailout plan, named ""Project Birch"", was mentioned by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in Parliament during a discussion about the survival of the aviation industry.",Lufthansa has agreed a rescue deal worth €9bn (£8bn) with the German government that saves it from collapse.
"UK police caught almost 6,000 drivers using their devices while driving in the four weeks after 1 March. The numbers were obtained by the Press Association under the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act. In March, the penalty for using a phone while driving doubled to £200 and six penalty points. Under the rules, new drivers caught using a phone within two years of passing their driving test will have their licence revoked altogether. The high number of people breaking the law means the ""key message still isn't sinking in"", said Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity The RAC Foundation. ""Driving is a safety-critical activity that requires our full attention. Hands need to be on the wheel and eyes looking out of the windscreen, not down at the phone screen,"" he added. Road safety charity Brake called for the £200 fine to be ""significantly increased"" to deter offenders. ""Driver distraction is a growing menace and it's worrying that drivers don't seem to be getting the message,"" said Brake spokesman Jack Kushner. AA president Edmund King said changing drivers' attitudes would take time: ""We know we can't change the attitudes and actions of all drivers overnight. ""We now have stricter penalties so need to continue with education campaigns (including driving schools) plus more police enforcement."" Details of incidents reported by police: Pressure to prevent drivers using phones intensified last year in the wake of several high-profile cases as well as research indicating it was widespread. In October, lorry driver Tomasz Kroker, who killed a mother and three children while distracted by his phone, was jailed for 10 years. In 2015 - the latest year for which figures are available - 22 people were killed and 99 seriously injured in accidents where a driver was using their phone.","More than 200 drivers a day were caught using a mobile at the wheel immediately after tougher penalties for the offence came into effect, figures show."
"By Simon ReadBusiness reporter This statement comes from a former theme park worker, but is a typical view of the estimated five million UK people with no job security. Now some zero-hours contract workers are set to be offered greater security under a new Living Hours programme. It will require organisations to pay the Living Wage and give workers with at least four weeks' notice of shifts. Under the programme - created by charity The Living Wage Foundation - workers will also get a contract that accurately reflects hours worked, and a guaranteed minimum of 16 hours a week. Commitments to the programme have already been made by major Living Wage employers including Richer Sounds, SSE and Standard Life Aberdeen, who will receive Living Hours accreditation. Julian Richer, Founder and Managing Director of Richer Sounds, said: ""If you treat the people who work for you well, you're going to have happier, more motivated staff, and ones that stay with you for years. ""Offering Living Hours is a great way to provide workers with security, but it's also going to help businesses in the long-run."" A zero-hours contract worker's tale A former theme park worker, who asked to remain anonymous, explained why being on a zero-hours contract affected their mental health. ""Our rota for the week was sent out on Sunday evenings and, with shifts regularly changing, I couldn't plan my week and always felt that I had to be available to work. ""I also worked as a 'breaker', which meant spending the whole day at work but only being paid for the couple of hours a day spent covering other colleagues' shifts when they took a break. ""If the weather was bad or suddenly turned, the theme park would be closed and everyone sent home. ""Sometimes this meant giving up a whole day but only being paid for an hours' work, or not at all, which didn't even cover my bus fare to work. I've since moved to a new job which has a full-time contract, which means I'm able to save money and plan my week to spend time with family."" ""The Living Wage has put almost £1bn extra into the pockets of more than 200,000 workers, but it's increasingly clear that pay is not the only driver of in-work poverty,"" said Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation. ""A lack of secure, stable hours is leaving millions of families struggling to keep their heads above water. This isn't good for workers or businesses."" She warned that constant uncertainty over the number of hours, timings of shifts or the amount of pay people get each week places them under enormous pressure. ""A shift cancelled at the last minute might sound small, but it can be the difference between being able to pay for your family's dinner that night or going hungry. And being expected to work at short notice means you can't plan around other costs and commitments."" More than five million workers earn less than the real Living Wage and are in a form of insecure work, two million of which are parents, the charity said. More than a fifth of workers aged 16-24 are in low-paid, insecure work, and in most types of insecure work measured, young people are worst affected. Wales, the North East and the West Midlands have the highest rates of low paid, insecure work, with Scotland, the South East and London the lowest. ""Everyone should have the right to guaranteed hours. But many workers are kept on a string - not knowing how much work they'll have from one week to the next,"" pointed out TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady. She pointed out that it can make planning and making ends meet a nightmare. ""It's time to end this limbo and give people fair notice of their hours and compensation if their shifts are cancelled.""","""Working on a zero-hours contract made me feel exhausted and negatively affected my mental health."""
"Simon JackBusiness editor@BBCSimonJackon Twitter I'm told that many members of the full cabinet have yet to receive any documents to review ahead of Friday's crunch talks. Media reports - that businesses would get a heads up before ministers - were dismissed by senior government sources. However, the government IS hoping that business will do its bit by responding positively to what the government will claim is a new level of post-summit clarity. It hopes business will be just as noisy in welcoming it as they were in complaining about its absence in the last two weeks. Large manufacturers including Airbus, BMW and Nissan have all recently warned that future investment in the UK is threatened by lack of clarity on future trading arrangements with the EU, with specific worries about delays at borders caused by new customs procedures. It's been reported that a new idea will be unveiled at the summit on how to keep the borders friction free - a third way between the two options already considered. Options To refresh memories, the first option - the maximum facilitation (or ""max fac"") model - envisages using new (as yet unspecified) technology to reduce (not eliminate) friction at our ports, airports and, crucially, at the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The second, a ""new customs partnership"" would see the UK collecting EU tariffs on goods bound for European markets on the EU's behalf - and sending them on to Brussels - with the option of paying refunds on goods remaining in the UK. I'm told that of the two options, the latter was winning the argument in cabinet as it's much cheaper for business and does away with the need for any new physical borders with the EU - particularly important on the island of Ireland. It therefore seems likely that any third way will look more like the customs partnership than the max-fac model. The problem is that both have been dismissed by the EU as unworkable and that is why some business leaders I've spoken to are sceptical that Chequers and the subsequent White Paper will herald the kind of breakthrough businesses crave. ""Alice in Wonderland"" summit One veteran business leader described the Chequers summit as an ""Alice in Wonderland"" meeting. Another told me the credibility of senior UK managers at multinational companies was ""completely shot"" as messages of reassurance from the government - that were dutifully carried back to their international boards - proved to be ""meaningless promises"". However, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Dr Adam Marshall, told the BBC that if the government delivers a settled position from which to base negotiations, business will say ""hallelujah"". A senior cabinet minister hoped that Friday's summit would prove to be a ""big moment"" in the history of the Brexit process. If the Chequers summit produces a clear position, which has broad support from her own government and provides business with a sense of clarity about what the UK is trying to achieve, then it will have been one. Theresa May and David Davis will feel they can then finally turn OUTWARD to the EU and legitimately ask them to use more imagination in finding a solution that delivers a version of Brexit which is in the economic interests of both sides.","Business leaders have been told they will get a preview of the government's final position on customs and trading arrangements ahead of the publication of a government White Paper next Thursday - but NOT before the whole cabinet thrashes out the final contents of the paper on Friday at the Prime Minister's country retreat, Chequers."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Workers aged 25 and over on the National Living Wage will receive £8.21 an hour from Monday, up from £7.83 - a 4.9% rise. Pay rises also take effect for younger workers on minimum wages. However, the pay rise comes as bills ranging from council tax to the TV licence fee become more expensive. Women represent an estimated 60% of those who are benefitting from the rise in minimum wage rates. Workers in the hospitality and retail sectors are the most likely to be on the lowest pay, and nearly 200,000 of them will receive the pay rise. ""We are pleased that million of workers across the country will see an above-inflation pay rise,"" said Bryan Sanderson, who chairs the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the appropriate level of pay. He pointed out that 20 years since the introduction of the minimum wage, there had been no significant effect on jobs, despite the extra cost to businesses. In that time, the minimum wage has risen much faster than average pay. Workers in general have seen wage growth beat inflation in recent months, after a period when price rises were greater than pay rises. However, all households are seeing increases in a variety of regular bills. They include: Other changes include a small rise in water bills, various increases on vehicle tax rates, and a rise in some companies' phone and broadband prices. However, price caps are now in effect for household rent-to-own items, limiting the interest that customers pay to no more than the product's cost, and phone calls to directory enquiries. Call for more pay Minimum wages in the UK are among the highest compared to typical pay in advanced economies of the world. The government said that it was ""determined"" for low pay to end. However, the TUC has argued that minimum wage levels remain too low. It wants all workers aged between 21 and 24 to receive the same as those aged 25 and over, and for them all to receive £10 a hour. ""Young workers are still getting a raw deal on pay. Their bills are not any cheaper, but they have to make ends meet with less. That is just not fair,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. There has been a long-running campaign encouraging businesses to pay their workers a higher amount. Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""Over 5,000 responsible employers have gone beyond the government minimum and committed to pay a real living wage. We now need to see more businesses step up and provide a wage that truly covers the cost of living."" National Living Wage v real living wage",Two million UK workers on minimum wages are now receiving a pay rise - but a string of household bills have also increased.
"This would make China the fast food chain's second-largest market after the US. McDonald's also wants to open 250 outlets in Hong Kong and South Korea in the same period. High-growth markets including Russia accounted for nearly a quarter of McDonald's total sales in 2015. The firm already has more than 2,200 outlets in China. It's looking for franchisees in all three Asian locations, and plans to franchise 95% of its outlets worldwide in the long-term. McDonald's and rival Yum Brands, the owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, have been facing increasing competition from cheaper local rivals, particularly in China, where they are trying to recover from food safety scares.

"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News The B6 Venator Spyder, a two-seater with rear lights modelled on the jet engines of modern fighter planes, represents Spyker's battle for survival. Currently the company makes just one type of car - the C8 Aileron - and it produces only one a week, hand built to a customer's precise specifications in its Netherlands-based factory of only 45 people. This type of customisation doesn't come cheap. The C8 sells for around 200,000 euros (£169,200) and with production coinciding with the 2008 global financial crisis, it's not surprising that demand has been slow. Its two new models - the B6 Venator Spyder car and the B6 Venator Coupe, launched in Geneva in March - are aimed at changing all of this. Both will be significantly cheaper with the B6 Venator Spyder expected to sell for about £120,000 and the B6 Venator Coupe for £110,000. ""All of a sudden you get into an area where tens of thousands of potential buyers are available,"" says chief executive Victor Muller. ""It's a statement to the market that we have come back with a vengeance and that we're here to stay. It's much more than just a new car. It symbolises the new Spyker."" Mr Muller says the cars will be a ""game changer"" for Spyker's business model because it will take it from being a niche car manufacturer to a mid-market one. It plans to ramp up production next year to between 250 and 500 cars a year, up to 10 times the 50 cars it is able to produce currently. Fight for survival Just two years ago, the company was close to going under. Its 2010 purchase of Saab - one of Sweden's best-known car brands - failed spectacularly. Less than two years after shelling out $74m (£47.7m) for the brand, Saab went bankrupt, almost taking Spyker down with it. ""It was the biggest setback of my business career. It was like losing a very close relative,"" says Mr Muller. Spyker was forced to seek outside help. Eventually it secured a deal with Chinese car manufacturer Youngman, which agreed to invest 10m euros (£8.5m) in Spyker and contribute a cool 25m euros in cash to fund its development of a new sport utility vehicle (SUV). This came at a price however, with Spyker having to relinquish almost a third of the business (29.9%) to Youngman. ""It's a very simple sacrifice to make that you will give up some of your autonomy in favour of sheer existence,"" says Mr Muller. ""We wouldn't be here if we didn't have third-party investors. It's as simple as that. ""So it's really not a compromise. I was willing to do anything and everything for Spyker to survive and become a viable business again,"" says Mr Muller. 'Hard ride' The problems of the past two years echo what has been a bumpy history for the company since its revival in 2000. Its financial restructuring in 2012 produced its sole profit in its 13-year history. And its ill-fated ownership of an Formula 1 team in 2006, which Spyker sold on a year later at a massive loss, also almost took the company under. ""It's been a very hard ride but self-inflicted and we made it very hard,"" says Mr Muller. The new models mark Spyker's last chance. ""Without it, it's difficult to see how the company could continue to grow or exist with just a few dozen cars here or there,"" says John Walton, former vice-president of Aston Martin, who joined Spyker as its chief commercial officer last year. Whether the new cars will succeed in finally turning Spyker into a profitable car maker is still uncertain. Production of both the new models will only start next year. And as Tim Urquhart, senior analyst at IHS Automotive, says, there is a long way to go before then. ""Spyker still has to find a distributor and dealership in all the major countries including the US, Europe and China,"" he says. However, Mr Urquhart is cautiously optimistic. ""These kind of cars are always going to be a slightly marginal business. But I think that it's a car that could sell and find a market."" Featured on both cars in small lettering is Spyker's motto - the same one it's had since 1914: ""Nulla tenaci invia est via"" meaning: ""For the tenacious no road is impassable"", something Mr Muller will be hoping the company lives up to. Escape from the Boardroom is a five-part series, starting on 21 September, broadcast on BBC World News on Saturdays at 02:10 and 15:10, and Sundays at 09:10 and 21:10 (all times GMT).",When Dutch sports car manufacturer Spyker unveiled its latest model at the Quail Motorsports Gathering in California's Pebble Beach last month it was about more than just a car.
"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter Holidaymakers prevented from flying by travel restrictions or lockdowns may not be entitled to a refund. More than two million people have not got their money back, Which? said. Travel restrictions remain in place in the UK, with travellers arriving from ""high-risk"" countries having to stay in quarantine hotels. Most of the people who were unable to take flights were hit by circumstances which meant they reasonably, or in some cases, legally, could not travel to their destination, Which? said. It is warning people to be wary of booking flights for this summer and to wait until the situation around international travel becomes clearer. The consumer group said in the longer-term booking a package holiday rather than a flight-only booking should give stronger passenger protections. People should only book with a trusted provider with a generous and flexible booking policy, it said. No flight refund Travel restrictions introduced at the Spanish border on Christmas Eve meant the Howe family couldn't take their trip to Lanzarote. They were able to cancel their accommodation free of charge, but it was a different story with their flights. ""We asked for a refund, but was told as the flight was still operating, we weren't entitled,"" Rebecca Howe told the BBC. It has left the family £980 out of pocket, and they're far from alone in losing cash paid for flights. Prevented from travelling Hopeful holidaymakers have been prevented from travelling because of local or national lockdowns and restrictions preventing entry at their destination, or the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office advising against non-essential travel. But in cases where the airline did not cancel the flight, customers may not be legally entitled to a refund or guaranteed a successful claim through their travel insurance or bank. Which? said passengers in these circumstances would often have only been given the choice of rebooking their flight or losing their money. Rebecca Howe said she was offered the choice to rebook her Ryanair flights for free up until the end of March, but that was no good. ""For one thing all the Ryanair flights to Lanzarote between Christmas and the end of March were less than half the price as we paid a premium to travel over New Year. ""If we'd accepted a cheaper flight, we would have lost the difference."" But with the only practical date available for the family to go was February half-term, even that was no good. ""Someone at my work had already it booked as annual leave so I couldn't take the time off as we are only allowed one person out."" They're now trying to reclaim the money via a chargeback request through their bank, ""But there's no guarantee it'll be successful so at the moment we're accepting we have lost the money."" Travel warning Donna Smullen and her husband from Cheshire had booked flights to Spain with Ryanair in September 2019, long before the start of the pandemic. They were due to travel in August 2020, but at the end of July, the FCDO warned against non-essential travel to Spain. That warning invalidates most travel insurance. A two-week quarantine was also introduced for flights returning from mainland Spain. Due to their jobs, quarantining was not an option for the couple. ""We were told by Ryanair we could change the date of our flights for a fee of €30 to €90 (£26 to £78) per person per flight, as long as we travelled before the end of 2020,"" she said. That meant rebooking would have been more expensive than the flights themselves, so they took the hit and were left more than £500 out of pocket. Ryanair said that passengers who book non-refundable flights are not entitled to refunds if they choose not to travel on flights which have operated. However, passengers can avoid being out of pocket by ""availing of Ryanair's change facility, even for bookings which were made prior to any Covid-19 flight restrictions being introduced."" Full refund Which? has shared its findings with the CMA to aid an investigation into whether airlines have breached consumers' legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""With non-essential travel currently illegal, airlines must play their part in protecting public health by ensuring no-one is left out of pocket for abiding by the law and not travelling. ""All airlines should allow passengers the option to cancel for a full refund, as well as fee-free rebooking options, while these restrictions remain in place.""","Millions of people are out of pocket on flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, according to consumer group Which?."
"By Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News They include a petrol-powered version of one of the UK's best-selling family cars, the Nissan Qashqai. The law firm behind the case, Harcus Parker, claims that some cars produced up to 15 times the legal level of nitrogen oxides when used on the road. Both companies deny the claims. Harcus Parker says it has seen independent test data which suggests that 1.3 million diesel cars built by Nissan and its French partner Renault may have been fitted with defeat devices. These are systems which turn emissions controls on when the vehicle is being tested, but switches them off when it is being used on the road - in order to improve their performance, reliability or both. Emissions scrutiny But it also claims that up to 100,000 petrol powered cars may have been affected as well. These are Nissan Qashqais fitted with a 1.2 litre engine. Emissions from diesel vehicles have come under heavy scrutiny since 2015, following a major scandal involving the German giant Volkswagen. Volkswagen has paid out more than €30bn (£27bn) in fines, compensation and buyback schemes as a result. It is continuing to fight a number of consumer lawsuits, including one in the UK involving some 90,000 car owners. Petrol cars, however, generally produce lower quantities of nitrogen oxides (NOx) than diesels, and have not previously been shown to have been involved in emissions cheating - although there have been some claims to the contrary. Harcus Parker claims that the 1.2l Qashqai produces many times the legal level of NOx when used in real world driving conditions. It says that tests carried out by the Department for Transport (DfT) in 2017 confirmed that this was the case. The DfT subsequently asked Nissan if it could modify the design to reduce emissions - but this never happened. 'Best behaviour' ""For the first time, we have seen evidence that car manufacturers may be cheating emissions tests of petrol, as well as diesel vehicles"", says Damon Parker, senior partner at the law firm. ""The data suggests to me these vehicles much like some VWs and Mercedes cars, know when they are being tested - and are on their best behaviour then and only then"". Harcus Parker claims this means customers overpaid for their vehicles, and should be entitled to some £5,000 each in compensation. ""All Groupe Renault vehicles are, and always have been, type-approved in accordance with the laws and regulations for all the countries in which they are sold and are not fitted with 'defeat devices'"", Renault said in a statement. Nissan said the following in response to the planned lawsuit: ""Nissan strongly refutes these claims. Nissan has not and does not employ defeat devices in any of the cars that we make, and all Nissan vehicles fully comply with applicable emissions legislation."" Nissan said the 2017 report showed variances for most brands involved. and that it said that the Nissan vehicle tested complied ""with all required regulatory limits."" Emissions Analytics, an independent firm which specialises in emissions testing carried out in 'real world' conditions, agrees that the petrol Qashqai does produce very high levels of NOx. ""We tested this same engine some time ago"", says founder Nick Molden. ""We found it produced about 16 times more NOx in real world conditions than the official level"". Nissan, however, insists that ""emissions standards have evolved since 2017, and we have introduced a new range of powertrains to meet them"".","Up to 1.4 million Renault and Nissan vehicles sold in Britain could be equipped with illegal defeat devices, according to a lawsuit being launched today."
"By Theo LeggettBusiness reporter, BBC News One of the big choices facing buyers is whether to get something new, or a used model with a few miles on the clock. But would you believe me if I told you that sometimes it is possible to get a new car for the price of a second-hand model? Well, apparently you can. The car I am looking at appears to be brand new. It is a shiny silver Renault Megane, registered in 2014, and it has just six miles on the clock. There isn't a fleck of dirt on it, the interior still has that unique new car smell, and its tyres have barely kissed the tarmac. Yet as far as the motor trade is concerned, the Renault is a used vehicle, and it has a price tag to match. It is on the market for £12,999, several thousand pounds less than you'd normally expect to pay for a new model. Bargains like this can be found quite easily, if you know where to find them - and if you are willing to make certain compromises. New or used? Research recently carried out by the AA suggests three-quarters of drivers plan to buy a new set of wheels within the next five years. For many people, the choice will ultimately boil down to cost. ""A lot of care needs to be taken,"" warns Ian Crowder of AA cars. ""Is the car going to be right for you - is it going do the job you want it to do? And how much is it going to cost? It's important to think about your budget and how you're going to pay for it."" ""And how long do you plan to keep it? That might dictate whether you go for a new car or a used one,"" he says. There are big advantages to owning a car that has never been driven. It is less likely to go wrong, and if it does, the manufacturer will sort it out under warranty. You know its history, and you are unlikely to find any nasty surprises. There is a catch though. Not only are new cars more expensive to buy, they also lose their value very quickly. In fact they can be worth up to 40% less the moment you drive them away from the dealership. New 'in effect' Yet there are circumstances in which it can cost you less - over time - to buy a new car than a used model. It may be the case, for example, if you are planning to pay for it on credit. This is because manufacturers frequently offer low-cost or interest-free loans on new cars, along with other incentives which may not be available for used car sales. A recent survey by What Car? Magazine suggests that, over a three-year period, new cars bought using a standard hire purchase agreement, or under a Personal Contract Purchase, can end up cheaper than used models about half of the time. This doesn't mean that new cars are actually cheaper of course, simply that there are good funding deals to be had, and that credit for used cars is often more expensive. Nevertheless it is entirely possible to buy a car that is, in effect, new, for the price of a second-hand model. 'Massive savings' Which brings me back to that Renault. The silver Megane is what is known as a ""nearly new"" or pre-registered car. It was first registered by a franchised dealer, who wanted to boost his sales figures in order to pick up lucrative incentives from the manufacturer. In effect, the dealer bought the car himself. ""For us, our best customers are people who buy second-hand or nearly new vehicles"", says Lee Arnold, general manager of Motorpoint in Peterborough. ""If you don't mind being the second owner of the vehicle, you can have massive savings off the retail price,"" he says. There is a catch of course. When you buy a pre-registered car, as Mr Arnold points out, you will be listed on the registration document as the second owner, which could affect the value when you come to sell it. If it is a few months old, the warranty will be that bit shorter as well. There is also less choice; you have to accept what is available, and may not be able to get the precise model you want. But if you are not worried about the colour or the number of cup-holders, there are some good deals to be had. The key, when you're thinking about buying a car, is always to do your research first. That way you could end up driving off with a bargain - and avoid any nasty surprises.","Buying a car can be exciting, but it can also be quite a headache."
"By Gabriella MulliganTechnology of business reporter When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change. This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street. It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet. Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2. UK-based Econic Technologies has invented a way of encouraging CO2 - a typically unreactive gas - to react with the petrochemical raw materials used in the making of many plastics. In this catalysed form, the CO2 can make up to 50% of the ingredients needed for making plastic. And recycling existing CO2 in this way reduces the amount of new CO2 emissions usually resulting from the process. ""Our aim is that by 2026, the technology will be used to make at least 30% of the polyols [the units making up plastic] made globally, and that would reduce CO2 emission by 3.5 million tonnes each year,"" explains Rowena Sellens, chief executive of Econic Technologies. ""This is equivalent to taking more than two million cars off the road."" The company is currently working with partners in industry to introduce its technology to market. Canadian company CarbonCure Technologies is recycling CO2 and putting it into concrete. CarbonCure takes waste CO2 from industrial emitters - such as fertiliser producers - and injects controlled doses of the liquid gas directly into the concrete truck or mixer. The reaction that takes place creates calcium carbonate particles that become permanently bound within the concrete - and make the concrete up to 20% stronger. Today, CarbonCure's technology is installed in more than 60 concrete plants across Canada and the US, supplying hundreds of construction projects. Another company, Carbon Engineering, captures CO2 and uses it to make diesel and jet fuel. While Carbon Clean Solutions, in the Indian port of Tuticorin, captures CO2 from a coal-fired power plant and turns it into soda ash (sodium carbonate), an ingredient in fertilisers, synthetic detergents and dyes. But will such carbon capture efforts really make much difference? Simply put, levels of ""greenhouse gases"" - CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are the main ones - have been rising rapidly because we've been burning fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - to make electricity and power our transportation, amongst other human activities. At the 2015 Paris climate conference, 195 countries agreed to try to keep global temperatures to within 2C of pre-industrial times by reducing emissions. But to achieve this target by 2030, the world needs to cut emissions - CO2 accounts for about 70% - by 12 to 14 gigatonnes per year, says John Christensen, director of a partnership between the UN Environment Programme and the Technical University of Denmark. A gigatonne is a billion tonnes. Econic, by contrast, hopes that by 2026, its technology will be responsible for reducing CO2 emissions by 3.5 million tonnes each year. And CarbonCure has demonstrated that its technology can help a typical medium-sized concrete producer reduce CO2 emissions by 900 tonnes a year. Globally, the concrete industry could reduce CO2 emissions by more than 700 million tonnes a year, the company believes. ""It's great to have these options coming up,"" says Mr Christensen, ""but there's no silver bullet, no single solution."" Environmentalists are also concerned that such carbon capture technologies merely delay the fundamental shift society needs to make to become a low-carbon economy. A plastics factory producing less CO2 is still environmentally unfriendly, the argument goes. ""Research into new technologies and approaches that can help reduce carbon emissions is vital, but it must not become an excuse to delay action on tackling the root of the problem - our dependence on fossil fuels,"" says Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace UK. ""A process that appears to reduce emissions or increase efficiency can lock us into maintaining industries that could be replaced with much greener options."" In addition, Mr Christensen points out that these carbon capture technologies tend to be very costly because they are so small-scale. More Technology of Business ""The advances are positive but it's far from what is needed,"" he argues. Another challenge is what to do with the recycled carbon. Some have suggested burying it in the ground or deep under the ocean, but the consequences of this are not fully understood. So it's better to reduce the amount of emissions we produce in the first place through increased use of renewable energies, such as wind, hydro and solar power, environmentalists argue. This could reduce emissions by up to 50% of the amount needed. ""Use all the technologies available to bend the [emissions] curve down. Then carbon capture can come in,"" says Mr Christensen. ""It could have an important role to play.""","Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are contributing to global warming, so could technologies removing some of the gas from the atmosphere help slow the process?"
"By Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News It was already in discussions with landlords before the coronavirus outbreak, but those talks have now become more urgent. Debenhams has already closed 22 stores this year, with a further 28 to shut in 2021 as part of a turnaround plan. But as a result of Covid 19, it's having to revise its restructuring plans. The department store chain fell into the hands of its lenders last April, a group of banks and hedge funds led by US firm Silver Point Capital, after struggling for years to keep up with the competition. It has also faced rising costs in running its big stores as well as grappling with a huge amount of debt. It's now in a Catch-22 situation between its new owners and landlords. The BBC understands that the lenders don't want to extend credit to Debenhams, in other words put more money in, unless they know landlords will accept another round of swingeing rent cuts as well as a five month rent and service charge holiday. If landlords agree, this would probably happen via a CVA - a form of insolvency proceedings. It would be the second CVA Debenhams has undertaken in less than a year. 'Desperation' Landlords are caught between a rock and a hard place. Most are trying to do the right thing and help retailers who've seen a collapse in sales but landlords would ultimately go bust if they don't get rent. It's unclear whether Debenhams' proposals will get the required support from its landlords in time. One told the BBC: ""They're asking us to accept a deal on rent and service charge based on a percentage of the turnover but in reality, what they're offering would only just cover the service charge and a little bit of the rent."" ""It's a Hobson's choice,"" said another property owner. ""This is not bully boy tactics by Debenhams it's done out of desperation to save the business."" Landlords have been told that a number of restructuring scenarios are being explored which have ""varying outcomes"" for the business, landlords and Debenhams' 20,000 workers. One scenario is likely to be another form of administration with the aim of keeping as many stores open as possible. Debenhams declined to comment. Right now Debenhams' 142 stores are closed, along with much of the rest of the High Street. For Debenhams, this was already a make or break year but it seems that the coronavirus has simply brought all its long running problems to a head. .",Debenhams is heading for another major restructuring which could involve more store closures.
"The terms of the new oil contracts will be more favourable to foreign investors, who will be allowed a greater stake in long-term profits. Iran is gearing up for the lifting of sanctions following the nuclear deal with six world powers in July. The country has some of the biggest oil and gas reserves in the world. The new contracts were announced at a conference in Tehran attended by many of the world's major energy companies, including BP, Shell, Total, Statoil and Sinopec. There were, however, no US companies present. The energy majors are keen to exploit Iran's abundant reserves of oil. 'Not perfect' The new contracts put an end to the so-called buyback model, which has historically deterred foreign investors, where overseas contractors developed and operated an oil field before handing it over to Iran. Now, more lucrative longer-term contracts will be offered, where foreign companies can retain a stake in the field. About 50 oil and gas projects are expected to be unveiled during the Tehran conference, taking place on Saturday and Sunday. ""The contract models introduced today are not perfect or ideal, but an effective and responsive model for both sides,"" Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said. ""To continue to play a role [as a major oil supplier], we hope to enjoy working with reputable international oil companies under a win-win situation."" Mr Zaganeh added that Iran had ""no objection to or problem with the participation of US companies"". Iran has big plans to increase oil production in the coming years, from about three million barrels a day now to five million by the end of the decade. It has already pledged to increase output by 500,000 barrels a day once sanctions are lifted.",Iran has overhauled the way in which it offers contracts to foreign energy companies in a bid to attract up to $30bn of new investment.
"The Creative Industries Federation says film-making, music, advertising and video games are all big export earners but are often overlooked by ministers. It says enterprise zones, tax breaks and access to finance could help firms. The business secretary says he was committed to a ""deal"" with the sector. The role of the UK's creative industries, which also includes theatre, architecture, broadcasting, fashion, museums, and galleries was recognised when the government unveiled its industrial strategy Green Paper in January for boosting the post-Brexit economy. The Creative Industries Federation says ministers need to ""overhaul"" their approach. The federation has unveiled a blueprint of policy recommendations for the creative industries which it says is ""the fastest growing sector of the UK economy"". It said the creative economy supports 2.9m jobs, a rise of 5.1% between 2014 and 2015. Brexit means it is now ""even more crucial"" for the sector ""to deliver more jobs, trade and exports"", it adds. The federation's chief executive, John Kampfner, said: ""There has been a tendency to dismiss the creative industries as something lightweight while claiming the glory of billions of pounds in trade that comes from hits such as War Horse, Sherlock and Slumdog Millionaire."" He said the government should recognise that creative industries ""will be as important to future economic success as traditional industries, such as cars or oil and gas"". Among its other recommendations are campaigns to increase diversity in employment in the sector and advice for start-ups on exporting. Business Secretary Greg Clark said creative industries contributed nearly £90bn to the economy in 2015. He said TV producer Sir Peter Bazalgette is carrying out an independent review of how the sector ""can help drive prosperity across the country by developing new technologies, capitalising on intellectual property rights and encouraging creativity from people of all ages and backgrounds"". He added: ""Through our industrial strategy I want to ensure we build on this sector's strengths, which is why we have committed to an early sector deal for the industry in our green paper.""","Creative companies are becoming increasingly important to the UK's future economic success and should be at the heart of the government's new industrial strategy, a trade body says."
"Mr Cruz, who has been with BA since 2016, will be immediately replaced by Aer Lingus boss Sean Doyle. Mr Cruz will stay on as non-executive chairman for a transition period before Mr Doyle also takes on the role. BA has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with unions over redundancies and pay cuts. It is cutting about 10,000 staff, drawing criticism from staff and MPs who claim the airline has been following a ""fire and rehire"" policy. Luis Gallego, chief executive of IAG, which owns BA, said: ""We're navigating the worst crisis faced in our industry and I'm confident these internal promotions will ensure IAG is well placed to emerge in a strong position."" The shake-up is one of the first major movesby Mr Gallego who took over as IAG's chief executive last month, replacing long-standing boss Willie Walsh. ""This is a sign that the new chief executive of IAG, Luis Gallego, is flexing his muscles and trying to demonstrate he'll make the changes necessary to lead a sustained recovery for the airline group,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. New data from Heathrow showed the challenges being faced by the travel industry from the coronavirus pandemic. Just 1.2 million passengers travelled through the airport in September, down 82% compared with the same month last year. He's done the dirty work - now a fresh pair of hands is needed. Alex Cruz's most recent task at BA was to push through thousands of job cuts as well as changes to pay and conditions, which will see many remaining staff earning a lot less in future. Those cuts may have been necessary due to the Covid crisis, but the way BA went about it - effectively threatening to fire employees who refused to sign new contracts - provoked deep resentment and bitterness among the workforce. And he was hardly popular to begin with. He arrived at BA with a brief to cut costs and boost profitability, to enable the airline to compete with budget carriers. He succeeded, but at a price. Customer satisfaction fell sharply, leading to accusations that the BA brand was being sacrificed for short-term shareholder value. There were strikes over what was described as ""poverty pay"" by cabin crew. And repeated IT failures proved deeply embarrassing for the company. Now the man who appointed him, former IAG chief executive Willie Walsh, has retired. The new IAG boss, Luis Gallego, appears keen to make his mark and rebuild bridges with staff. Mr Cruz was very much part of the old regime. It should come as no surprise that he now has to step aside. 'Toughest challenge' Mr Doyle is returning to BA after just two years in charge at Aer Lingus, which is also owned by IAG. Prior to that, he had worked at BA since 1998. But Ms Streeter said: ""Sean Doyle will have his work cut out to make immediate progress given that British Airways is facing the toughest challenge in its history as demand for international travel has plummeted and quarantine restrictions continue to constrain bookings."" Mr Cruz's tenure as BA's boss has been eventful. In September last year, the airline's pilots staged their first ever strike which led to 2,325 flights being cancelled and cost BA €137m (£124m). It has also suffered a number of costly IT problems, including an incident in 2017 that left 75,000 flyers stranded and cost the airline £80m. Last year, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced it intended to fine BA a record £183m after a breach of its security system, exposing hundreds of thousands of customer details. The ICO and BA are still in discussions regarding the fine. IAG declined to comment on whether Mr Cruz would receive any compensation when he leaves BA once the transition period is completed. It also declined to say how long the transition period would last.","British Airways has announced it is replacing its chief executive Alex Cruz as the airline navigates ""the worst crisis"" facing its industry."
"The supermarket chain said sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.7% excluding fuel in the 14 weeks to 3 January. Total sales fell 0.4%. However, Sainsbury's said the week before Christmas was a ""record"", with 29.5 million customer transactions. The latest figures were also an improvement on the previous quarter, when like-for-like sales excluding fuel fell 2.8%, and were better than analysts' expectations of a drop in like-for-like sales of 2.5-4.4%. Sainsbury's shares, which have fallen 36% over the past year, rose 1.3% following the trading update. Local shopping Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe said he expected like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter to be similar to its first half performance due to ""the uncertainty in the trading environment, food price deflation and price reductions"". ""Broadly we sold the same amount of stuff last year, just at lower prices,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. He said the sales figures also reflected the trend of more frequent and local shopping, with its convenience business growing 16% in the quarter. Christmas Eve marked Sainsbury's biggest trading day in its convenience stores, with sales totalling £8m. The third quarter was also its biggest Christmas for online sales, with the chain delivering 110,000 orders in the three days to 23 December. Its clothing business also performed well, with sales up 10% year-on-year. Christmas jumpers were the stand-out performer, with sales doubling compared with last year and a snowman jumper proving its most popular design. Price wars The figures come a day after Sainsbury's said it would cut the prices of 1,000 of its most popular products as part of a £150m programme announced in November. Rival Asda announced similar plans on Tuesday, saying it would invest £300m in the first quarter of 2015 on cutting prices. The plans mark the latest salvo in a bitter price war as the ""big four"" supermarkets, which also include Tesco and Morrisons, battle for customers. A combination of increased competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl and customers shopping around for bargains mean none of the big four are expected to report an increase in like-for-like sales over the Christmas period. Attention will now shift to Tesco and Marks and Spencer, which will both issue trading updates for the Christmas period on Thursday. Phil Dorrell, director of retail consultancy Retail Remedy, said the third quarter numbers highlighted ""the challenges facing Sainsbury's and the rest of the big four"". ""Focusing overly on price could damage the reputation for quality Sainsbury's has built up over the years. It can't afford to cut corners on quality, it's not in a position to make many workforce savings, and it's no Asda, so either the suppliers have got to play ball or margins are going to be squeezed.""","Sainsbury's has warned the outlook for the rest of the financial year will ""remain challenging"" after reporting a drop in like-for-like sales over the key Christmas trading period."
"Theresa May has launched a consultation on whether mandatory reporting will help address disparities between the pay and career prospects of minorities. She acknowledged that minorities often ""feel like they are hitting a brick wall"" at work. The move follows the decision to make firms reveal their gender pay gaps. Downing Street said the consultation would allow businesses to share views on what information should be published ""to allow for decisive action to be taken"" while at the same time avoiding ""undue burdens on businesses"". It will run until January. The government's Race Disparity Audit last year showed widely varying outcomes in areas including education, employment, health and criminal justice between Britain's white and ethnic minority populations. It found that Asian, black and other ethnic groups were disproportionately likely to be on a low income, with just 1% of non-white police officers in senior roles. Within NHS England, it found that 18% of white job applicants shortlisted got the job, compared with 11% of ethnic minorities. Mrs May said: ""Our focus is now on making sure the UK's organisations, boardrooms and senior management teams are truly reflective of the workplaces they manage, and the measures we are taking today will help employers identify the actions needed to create a fairer and more diverse workforce."" 'Catalyst for action' Mrs May is also due to unveil a Race at Work Charter signed by firms including accountancy giant KPMG, advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi, and public sector bodies including NHS England and the Civil Service. The charter, designed with Business in the Community, commits signatories to increasing recruitment and career progression of ethnic minority employees. The prime minister said: ""Every employee deserves the opportunity to progress and fulfil their potential in their chosen field, regardless of which background they are from, but too often ethnic minority employees feel they're hitting a brick wall when it comes to career progression."" The consultation was welcomed by the CBI employers' group. Matthew Fell, chief UK policy director, said: ""Transparency can be a catalyst for action in tackling the ethnicity pay gap, in the same way that it has been so successful for gender."" The Equality and Human Rights Commission also supported it, with its chairman David Isaac saying: ""Extending mandatory reporting beyond gender will... give employers the insight they need to identify and remove barriers to ethnic minority staff joining and progressing to the highest level in their organisations.""",Companies may be forced to reveal their ethnicity pay gap under plans unveiled by the prime minister to help minorities at work.
"By Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent And that's one of the key reasons why China has been able to catch up. Dr Schmidt, who is currently the Chairman of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, said he thinks the US is still ahead of China in tech innovation, for now. But that the gap is narrowing fast. ""There's a real focus in China around invention and new AI techniques,"" he told the BBC's Talking Business Asia programme. ""In the race for publishing papers China has now caught up."" China displaced the US as the world's top research publisher in science and engineering in 2018, according to data from the World Economic Forum. That's significant because it shows how much China is focusing on research and development in comparison to the US. For example, Chinese telecoms infrastructure giant Huawei spends as much as $20bn (£15.6bn) on research and development - one of the highest budgets in the world. This R&D is helping Chinese tech firms get ahead in key areas like artificial intelligence and 5G. Dr Schmidt blames the narrowing of the innovation gap between the US and China on the lack of funding in the US. ""For my whole life, the US has been the unquestioned leader of R&D,"" the former Google boss said. ""Funding was the equivalent of 2% or so of GDP of the country. Recently R&D has fallen to a lower percentage number than was there before Sputnik."" According to Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a US research institute, the US government now invests less in R&D compared to the size of the economy than it has in more than 60 years. This has resulted in ""stagnant productivity growth, lagging competitiveness and reduced innovation"". Dr Schmidt also said the US's tech supremacy has been built on the back of the international talent that's been allowed to work and study in the US - and warns the US risks falling further behind if this kind of talent isn't allowed into the country. Tech war ""This high skills immigration is crucial to American competitiveness, global competitiveness, building these new companies and so forth,"" he said. ""America does not have enough people with those skills."" The US has been embroiled in a tech cold war with China and in recent months has stepped up its anti-China rhetoric. This week it revoked the visas of 1,000 Chinese students it claims have military links and accused Chinese tech firms of acting as agents for the Chinese Communist Party - claims Beijing and these companies reject. The Trump administration has also taken steps to block Chinese tech firms like Huawei and Chinese apps including TikTok and WeChat, saying they pose threats to national security. Beijing has said this is ""naked bullying"", and Dr Schmidt says the bans will mean China will be even more likely to invest in its own domestic manufacturing. Dr Schmidt says the right strategy for a US-China relationship is what is called a 'rivalry partnership' where the US needs to be able to ""collaborate with China, while also competing with them"". ""When we're rivals, we are rough, we are pursuing things. We're competing hard, we're trying to get advantage - real competition - which the US can do well, and which China can do well. But there's also plenty of areas where we need to be partners.""","In the battle for tech supremacy between the US and China, America has ""dropped the ball"" in funding for basic research, according to former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt."
"The new service will operate under the Star brand and stream a wider variety of content than Disney+. The firm said Disney+ had already attracted 60.5 million subscribers. But the media giant reported enormous losses due to the pandemic as its theme parks closed. Disney lost $4.7bn (£3.6bn) in the three months to 27 June, as the virus forced it to close theme parks and delay film releases and production. That was down from nearly $1.8bn profit in the same period last year. It said the pandemic was responsible for a $3bn hit to its operating income - mostly due to the disruption to its theme parks, where revenues plunged 85% compared to 2019, chief financial officer Christine McCarthy said. Overall revenue fell 42% compared with last year to $11.8bn. Disney+ streaming hopes As it grapples with coronavirus disruption, the firm is forging ahead with its streaming ambitions, as it tries to position itself as a rival to Netflix, Amazon and other streaming sites. Last November, it launched the Disney+ streaming service in the US, later expanding into other markets, including the UK. Disney said it now has more than 100 million subscribers across its on-demand sites, which also include ESPN+, the general audience Hulu television site in the US, and the Hotstar streaming service in India. The new international service will be somewhat similar to Hulu, but build on the name recognition of the Star name outside of the US, where Hulu is not as well-known, executives said. It will offer material from the wider Disney empire, which includes broadcaster ABC, 20th Century Films and SearchLight Pictures. Chief executive Bob Chapek said Disney now plans to release its new live action remake of Mulan on Disney+ in a $30 ""premier access"" deal in September. The decision to skip most of the world's cinemas and go straight to streaming follows uncertainty about when big film theatre chains in the US will be able to reopen. Where Disney+ is not available, the film will be released in cinemas. Mulan had been scheduled for release in March, but that has been postponed several times as cinemas remain closed. Most recently, it was set to open on 21 August and cinema operators had hoped it would help spark a late-summer rebound for film revenues. Paolo Pescatore, an analyst at PP Foresight, said Disney's streaming gains were impressive but it would need to continue to add new shows and content if it hopes to compete. ""It must continue to aggressively promote its growing suite of video streaming services given the competitive nature of this market. There are too many services chasing too few dollars,"" he said. Beauty or Beast? And despite the subscriber gains, Disney's streaming business is not yet profitable, said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. That part of the business recorded a roughly $700m operating loss in the quarter. ""It's tempting to look to the new Disney+ business for good news, and there has certainly been good growth across all three major platforms,"" he said. ""However, this is really meant to be the icing on the cake rather than the main event - and launch costs mean losses in the division have mounted,"" he said. He praised Disney for keeping its overall costs in check but said the numbers ""are far more Beast than Beauty. The forced closure of the group's theme parks and no theatrical releases during the period mean revenue is on the floor.""",Disney plans to release Mulan on its Disney+ streaming site this year and launch a new streaming service outside the US next year as it tries to build on its early streaming success.
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent The IMF now expects growth of 3.5% this year, compared with the previous estimate of 3.8% which it made in October. The growth forecast for 2016 has also been cut, to 3.7%. The downgrade to the forecasts comes despite one major boost for the global economy - the sharp fall in oil prices, which is positive for most countries. The IMF expects that to be more than offset by negative factors, notably weaker investment. That in turn reflects diminished expectations about the growth prospects for many developed and emerging economies over the next few years. If business expects weaker growth, there is less opportunity to sell goods and services and so less incentive to invest. Deflation concerns The eurozone is a case in point. The IMF does expect the recovery there to continue, but not strongly. It is estimating growth of 1.2% in the euro area this year and 1.4% in 2016. For the European Central Bank, the immediate priority is to tackle the deflation, or falling prices, now under way. Speaking to the BBC, the IMF's chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, said deflation was an adverse and worrying force, but it was ""not the kiss of death… in itself, it's not going to derail the recovery"". However, he acknowledged that it was possible that deflation could set off the eurozone's debt crisis once again. Falling prices are particular problem for debtors, because their incomes - or for governments, their tax revenues - may fall, but the debt payments often do not. The slowdown in China is another factor behind the revised forecasts. On Tuesday, official figures showed that China's growth slowed to 7.4% last year, from 7.7% in 2013. Next year, the IMF growth forecast for China is 6.3%, compared with an average of 10% over the three decades up to 2010. Mr Blanchard said the IMF was ""fairly confident that is going to be an orderly slowdown"". The report says that slower growth in China will have important effects in other emerging economies in Asia. US strength The sharpest downgrade of all is for Russia, which is forecast to see its economy contract by 3% this year and 1% next. That is the result of the fall in oil prices and what the report calls increased geopolitical tensions - in other words, the crisis in Ukraine and Western sanctions on Russia. There is also a sharp downgrade for Nigeria, another oil exporter, although even the revised forecast of 4.8% for 2015 still shows strong growth. Without the downgrade, Nigeria's growth would have been very impressive. There are some exceptions to the pattern of more downbeat forecasts. The major one is the United States, now forecast to grow at 3.6% this year and 3.3% in 2016. This is well below China's figures, even allowing for the slowdown, but that is to be expected. Emerging economies can grow more rapidly by adopting technology that's already established in richer nations. For the UK, the forecast for this year is unchanged at 2.7% and is cut slightly to 2.4% for 2016. Mr Blanchard sees the outlook for the UK as favourable, but he said that the weakness of the eurozone could act as ""brake"" on the British economy. Crisis over? So six years on from the most intense phase of the global financial crisis, to what extent have we put it behind us? Mr Blanchard told the BBC that many countries have, for all practical purposes, done so - notably the US. But there is another legacy ""cramping the style of a number of countries which have very high debt and have to be careful"". He says this will take a very long time to rectify. He describes Japan as an extreme example. His overall assessment: ""Some of the legacies are going away. Some of the legacies will take a long time. Things are improving. Not quite as quickly as we would dream, but they do.""",The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its forecast for global economic growth for this year and next.
"Shares in the electric car maker started trade down more than 4%, but recovered to close in positive territory. The shares have dropped by about a fifth since Mr Musk revealed his proposal in a tweet on 7 August. Some analysts predict Tesla has further to fall: JPMorgan Chase has cut its price target from $308 to $195. The bank's analysts cited doubts about Mr Musk's claims to have secured funding for his plan to take the firm private. ""Tesla does appear to be exploring a going private transaction, but we now believe that such a process appears much less developed than we had earlier presumed (more along the lines of high level intention),"" said Ryan Brinkman at JP Morgan. The bank had raised its forecast following Mr Musk's tweet, which he later said was based on discussions with Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. However, Mr Brinkman said it was now clear that the fund's commitment remained uncertain: ""Formal incorporation into our valuation analysis seems premature at this time."" Tesla shares hit almost $380 on 7 August following Mr Musk's tweet, but have continued to fall since then. They opened below $293 on Monday - off by more than 4% - but regained ground over the course of trading to close at about $308, up almost 1%. The slide this month has been good news for short sellers, who bet that Tesla's share price will fall. In recent years, their holdings have declined in value as the share price rose sharply. Since the now infamous tweet, the value of their holdings has risen by more than $1.2bn, according to S3 Partners, a New York research firm. Mr Musk has a well-known dislike of short sellers, whom he has called ""jerks who want us to die"" and argued that taking Tesla off the stock exchange would shield it from their attacks.",Tesla shares remained volatile on Monday amid doubts about Elon Musk's ability to take the company private.
"The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month fell by 41,700 to 1.35 million. The unemployment rate drops to 7.7%, down from 7.8% the previous quarter. The number of people in work, both full-time and part-time, reached a record high of 29.87 million in the quarter, up 155,000. The ONS looks at demand for full-time work and whether part-time workers would rather work longer hours. It said almost 1.5 million people were part-time because they could not find full-time jobs, the highest figure since records began in 1992. The unemployment rate has become a key economic indicator for the Bank of England which, under its recently appointed new governor, Mark Carney, is targeting the unemployment rate. It says it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until it falls to 7%. The ONS also reported average earnings rose by 0.8% in the year to August. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym points out this increase in regular pay (excluding bonuses) equalled the lowest recorded in the history of this series. He adds that the fall of 0.1% in average earnings in the public sector over the year to August was the first time such a decrease had been recorded. Longer term There was a sharp difference in the number of men and women in part-time employment, with male part-timers increasing by 21,000 and women in part-time work falling by 13,000. But more women were finding full-time work than men, with male full-time employment up by 69,000 compared with a rise of 79,000 for women. Youth unemployment remains just below the one-million mark, with 958,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds, down by 1,000 over the quarter. The number of people unemployed for more than a year fell by 15,000 to 900,000. Those without work for between six months to a year rose by 29,000 to 446,000, but there was a fall of 32,000 people unemployed for up to six months, leaving 1.1 million in that position. The worst affected areas in the UK were in Birmingham Ladywood where the unemployment rate stands at 11.4% and in West Belfast where it is 9.3%. 'Standards' The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the figures were ""good news"". He added: ""These are welcome figures. Of course, we all want to see living standards improve, and last year disposable income increased. But the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the economy, keep producing the jobs and cut people's taxes."" The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said Mr Cameron should admit that there was ""a cost-of-living crisis in this country"". Mr Miliband said: ""Today's economic figures show a welcome fall in unemployment. They also show that prices have risen faster than wages and that is 39 out of 40 months that living standards have fallen since he became prime minister."" The Institute of Directors (IoD) said the jobs data showed the recovery was ""job-lite"". The IoD's chief economist, Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Today's labour market figures are not surprising. Just as employment losses during the recession were lower than expected, so too are employment gains with recovery. This isn't a jobless recovery but it is a job-lite one."" The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) gave a cautious welcome to the figures. Its chief economist, David Kern, said: ""Although concerns remain over youth and long-term employment, the figures show that Britain's labour market is strong and flexible, and that the economy should record satisfactory growth in the third quarter. The large fall in inactivity is particularly pleasing, as more people are returning to the workforce and are looking for jobs."" He added that he expected the unemployment rate to continue to fall steadily and that the 7% unemployment rate targeted by the Bank of England would be reached in the autumn of 2015, a year earlier than the Bank had indicated.","The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period, official figures show."
"The money, totalling 6.8bn euros ($8.7bn), will come from the troika of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But they said that Greece's reform programme is moving too slowly. The troika added that the country's economic outlook remains uncertain. Eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels said 2.5bn euros ($3.2bn) would come from the eurozone rescue fund and 1.5bn euros ($1.9bn) from European Central Bank. While the payments are likely to be made this month, another 500m euros ($643m) from the rescue fund, plus 500m euros from the European Central Bank will follow in October. Then the IMF will loan 1.8bn euros ($2.3bn), bringing the overall total to 6.8bn euros. Strings attached The loans are conditional on Greece making progress with its reform programme. Greece's creditors have warned that reforms are behind schedule, especially the privatisation of state assets. Last month, the sell-off of the public gas company collapsed. But the reforms have caused much anger in Greece. Around 25,000 civil servants will be put on reduced salaries, before either being dismissed or redeployed. That will add to the nation's unemployment rate which already stands at 27%. Meanwhile, thousands of Greek municipal workers and school teachers took to the streets of Athens on Monday in a noisy protest against public sector layoffs. Public unrest has lead to political instability, and four different Greek governments in as many years.","Greece has passed another hurdle in its bailout programme, by securing the next instalments of funds that are keeping the country afloat."
"Lower prices for food and computer goods helped to cut the rate from 0.3% in January, official figures show. February's figure is the lowest rate of Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation since estimates of the measure began in 1988. The drop in the CPI measure was sharper than many analysts had expected, with most expecting a rate of 0.1%. The February figure means that the cost of living is the same as it was a year earlier. It is worth pointing out that CPI only became the main measure of inflation in 2010. Before that the Retail Price Index, which includes housing costs and mortgage payments, was used. That index was negative for much of 2009. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the UK ""took another step towards deflation"" in February. ""It looks likely the rate will drop below zero at some point in the coming months, and hover around zero for most of the year,"" he said. Analysis: Robert Peston, BBC economics editor For now at least, the fall in the price of food, games, petrol and energy, if it persists for a few months, is good news for most of us - because it increases our spending power and our pounds go further. In other words we feel and are a bit richer. But if stagnation in prices were to go on for longer, if it were to turn into fully fledged deflation, that would be worrying. The point is that if we thought that the price of things we don't normally have to buy at any particular moment - household goods like washing machines for example, or motor cars - was on a firmly downward path, we would probably defer purchases of those things, and that would depress economic activity. Read Robert's blog in full. Low inflation could support UK economic growth, business lobby group the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said. ""We remain convinced that there is very little risk of a long period of deflation,"" said David Kern, BCC chief economist. ""Inflation in the service sector, which accounts for 80% of the UK economy, remains firmly above the government's 2% target, and core CPI inflation in February was 1.2%. ""Together with higher earnings, lower inflation is boosting people's spending power, and will contribute to economic growth in the year ahead,"" he said. Rain Newton-Smith, director of economics at business lobby group the CBI, said: ""Despite inflation dropping to zero, it is unlikely we will see falling prices for a prolonged period, particularly as the pressure from lower oil prices fades."" However, she added: ""With the Monetary Policy Committee still alert to the risk of very low inflation becoming entrenched, a rise in interest rates anytime soon seems off the cards."" Last week, the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane said rates were as likely to need cutting as raising in the immediate future. Cheaper energy In February, the Bank said that inflation could turn negative temporarily in the spring because of falling oil prices. Cuts in energy bills are among the factors likely to push inflation lower in March, according to economists. But unlike in the eurozone, where prices are already showing annual falls, many economists think UK consumer demand will remain steady in the face of falling prices, due to robust employment growth and signs of a pick-up in wages. Falling prices for food, laptops, tablets and computer peripherals contributed to the fall in February's CPI measure, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS figures also showed the rate of Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation fell to 1% from 1.1%. Political pitches Chancellor George Osborne told reporters that zero inflation was ""good news for families"", and that voters faced a choice in the general election on 7 May. ""Frozen prices are a first for the British economy. This zero inflation is driven by falling petrol prices and falling food prices, so it's good news for families,"" he said. However, Labour said inflation is falling around the world ""because global oil prices have plummeted, yet in Britain wages continue to be sluggish."" ""A few months of falling world oil prices won't solve the deep-seated problems in our economy,"" said said Cathy Jamieson, Labour's shadow Treasury minister. Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said: ""Coming alongside good growth and record numbers of jobs, Liberal Democrats in government are delivering a stronger economy and a fairer society."" ""It's yet another month that sees earnings pulling ahead of prices, which will be a great help to millions of families.""","UK inflation rate fell to 0% in February, the lowest since records began, official figures show."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Mr Woodford - one of the UK's most high-profile stockpickers - stopped money going in or out of his Woodford Equity Income Fund earlier in the week after increasing numbers of investors asked for their money back. Some of those investors would include pension funds, responsible for people's life savings. Thousands of individuals also chose the fund for their self-invested pensions or Individual Savings Accounts (Isas), often through fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown. The platform has been a cheerleader for Mr Woodford, but some say that went on for too long. Hargreaves Lansdown's share price has taken a heavy hit since Tuesday's announcement, falling another 6% on Wednesday. Many smaller investors are also questioning whether there were sufficient warnings about the possibility of being locked out of their investment. 'This isn't business as usual' Gus Harris-Reid, 32, has about £6,000 stuck in the suspended fund. ""If it was business as usual, I would not be concerned. Now, I may take some or all of it out and invest elsewhere when I can,"" the mechanical engineer from Edinburgh says. ""The bad publicity may mean a drop in value, though."" He says that all fund managers can suffer a bad year at any time and investors should be prepared for that. However, the suspension meant this was a different grade of seriousness. ""The fact it had to be blocked is concerning,"" he says. ""It has shaken my faith."" 'The situation is frustrating' Another 32-year-old, Robert Taylor, from London, says he was unaware that a fund could be locked up like this. ""It was not made clear that this could happen. It is frustrating,"" he says. He says there is likely to be a ""mad rush"" of people withdrawing when the fund reopens, although this simply risked realising a loss. ""I have an Isa regular saver and switched my portfolio to stop investing in Woodford around six months ago. I didn't sell my stake at the time as I presumed he'd eventually turn it around. This doesn't look to be the case and now I can't change my mind,"" he says. Former pensions minister Ros Altmann told the BBC that regulators needed to look at the risk warnings given to investors in general, as it should be made clear that in some circumstances, people would not be able to get money out. 'I never made any money out of Woodford' Paul Adams, from Birmingham, says that he sold his stake in the fund ""at a heavy loss"" just two weeks before the suspension. ""I invested in three of his funds due to his reputation. However, over the years I have seen my investments fall by as much as 33%,"" he says. ""I have never made any money out of Woodford."" He says that fund managers' reputations can take years to build up, but were quick to fall - and the value was ""nosediving"". He says he was ""bemused"" as to why Hargreaves Lansdown continued to promote the fund as one of its favourites, in its Wealth 50 list. Mr Woodford's funds were only removed from the chart on Monday. 'I was saving for my grandchildren' Stuart Evans says that he was already an investor using the Hargreaves Lansdown platform, and studied the Wealth 50 list for ideas for long-term investments to help pay for his grandchildren's further education in the future. ""As a result, I felt it was a reasonably sound investment,"" the 68-year-old says. ""I was looking for something that would not let me down and would grow steadily over the years."" At its launch of the Woodford fund, a research director at Hargreaves said that Mr Woodford ""was one of the finest fund managers of his generation"" and he intended to invest in the fund, as did his wife. There are 1.2 million people on the platform and it continued to promote the fund when it saw a significant downturn. ""We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford's multi-decade track record remains compelling - but we don't underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford's recent performance,"" Emma Wall, head of investment analysis at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the BBC. On Monday, it dropped the Woodford funds off its favourite list. On Wednesday, it bowed to pressure to drop its management fee for Woodford investors. It is not the only platform which promoted Woodford funds as an investment. Another - St James's Place - moved away from Woodford funds on Wednesday.",People with pensions and savings invested in Neil Woodford's now suspended flagship fund have expressed concern over how it was promoted.
"A smaller fall in the price of clothing was the main reason for the rise, the Office for National Statistics said. The Retail Prices Index measure of inflation was unchanged at 1% - the figure that will be used to calculate rail fare increases next year. CPI has been almost flat for the past six months, having turned negative in April for the first time since 1960. The ONS said falling food and non-alcoholic drink prices partially offset the positive impact of the smaller rise in clothes prices. The underlying measure of CPI inflation, which strips out increases in energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, rose to 1.2% in July, a five-month high. ""This is the sixth month running that headline inflation has been at or very close to zero,"" said Richard Campbell from the ONS. ""While households will have seen individual prices rise and fall, the overall shopping basket bought by the country remains little changed in price compared with a year ago."" 'Deflationary forces' Analysts say the inflation rate could fall back again, partly due to the drop in the price of oil, which has slumped by nearly a quarter in the past two months. ""This morning's inflation figures are higher than expected, but could easily fall back next month,"" said Peter Cameron at EdenTree Investment Management. ""Brent Crude has dropped below $50 a barrel and China, the world's largest exporter, is potentially now unleashing a new wave of deflationary forces around the world through the devaluation of its currency."" Analysis: Robert Peston, BBC business editor ""The rise in core inflation tells us that domestic demand for goods and services, from consumers and businesses, is reasonably robust. Which is a good thing: it underpins our economic recovery."" There has been considerable speculation over when the Bank of England - which has a target inflation rate of 2% - might start to raise interest rates. However, Mr Cameron said it was ""hard to envisage a rate rise this side of Christmas"". Samuel Tombs from Capital Economics said raising rates could be postponed until the second quarter next year, with inflation ""likely to turn negative again over the next few months"". However, the pound strengthened against the dollar immediately after the inflation rate was announced, reflecting the fact that the rate was higher than expected. The pound rose by almost a cent to $1.5667. This suggests that many investors felt the rise in inflation made an early rate rise more likely. ""The pick-up in core inflation reinforces the case for interest rates to start rising sooner rather than later, so the [Bank] does not fall behind the monetary policy curve,"" said PwC's John Hawksworth. Earlier this month, meeting notes of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee showed that members voted 8-1 to keep rates on hold at a record low of 0.5%.","The UK's inflation rate turned positive in July, with the Consumer Prices Index measure rising to 0.1% from June's 0%."
"The deal paves the way for a return to the consumer mobile phone market for BT, which disposed of its BT Cellnet network in 2001.

"By Katy AustinBBC business correspondent The process of being interviewed and receiving her six-month work visa took about six weeks. She is among 30 workers from non-EU countries who recently started at Cornish farm Riviera Produce as part of a Home Office trial. In total, 2,500 people from Ukraine, Moldova and Russia have been recruited for seasonal work on farms from the South of England to Scotland. ""I came here to earn money so I can start a business, a little shop with children's clothing and things for new mums"", 31-year-old Ms Savchenko says. ""We really like the work, although to start with it was a bit bumpy because of the weather. There's plenty of time to meet friends, to go to town and the seaside"". Ms Savchenko believes her compatriots hope the trial will continue in future. ""People in the Ukraine are hoping they'll have the opportunity to come and earn money and get somewhere in life, because the situation in Ukraine as regards work is quite hard."" Michailo Sudak, who used to be in the Ukrainian army, is on the same visa as Anastasia. He wanted to try new opportunities and found out about the job through a friend: ""It's good for us to be here because we can earn money here, to buy flats or a car when we go home. Because in Ukraine, it's impossible to do"". He found the visa expensive. But he likes the job and would consider returning. 'We can't get local people' David Simmons manages Riviera Produce, the farm in Cornwall where Ms Savchenko and Mr Sudak are working. He used to rely on migrant workers from EU countries such as Poland and Lithuania to pick his cauliflowers, courgettes and brassicas, then more recently Romania and Bulgaria. But in the past two years, their home economies picked up and the exchange rate became less favourable. Fewer have wanted to come. Mr Simmons also believes uncertainty over Brexit has put them off. ""We cannot get local people to come and harvest the crops. ""Without having these migrant workers the horticulture sector is dead. Last year in Cornwall there were crops that weren't harvested because there weren't enough staff,"" he says. The Home Office pilot Ms Savchenko and Mr Sudak are on is a test of how a visa based immigration programme for seasonal farm jobs could work. Two companies, Pro Force and Concordia, run the scheme's recruitment. Sorting visas for so many people was challenging, but has been achieved. Hundreds are already in the UK working. Stephanie Maurel, Concordia's chief executive, said interest in the scheme from potential workers was ""phenomenal"". ""We could have filled the visas we had three times over at least,"" she says. The pilot is not designed to provide all the workers the horticulture sector needs. However, the National Farmers' Union says it could help solve growers' recruitment problem. It is asking the government to drastically expand the scheme to 30,000 workers next year. Mr Simmons is also keen for the scheme to be expanded: ""Hopefully it'll demonstrate to the government that the scheme will work and can be rolled out. ""We've got the work here for them, it brings them in on a visa so they're restricted to come to our farm, and it's a win-win situation for all concerned"". The Home Office says it will ""keep the scheme under review to assess how successful it has been"", adding that this will help determine longer-term arrangements. It is also engaging with the wider agricultural sector as it looks to design the UK's future immigration system.",Anastasia Savchenko was at agricultural university in Kharkiv in Ukraine when she saw a Facebook advert for a job picking courgettes on a farm in Cornwall.
"Ukraine's interim PM, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, said Moscow's hikes were a form of ""economic aggression"". His energy minister said Ukraine would try to negotiate a gas deal, but warned that if talks failed Ukrainians should prepare for Russia to cut off supplies. Moscow says the price change is due to Kiev's failure to pay its bills. Russia's state-controlled company Gazprom has raised the cost of gas to Ukraine by 81% to $485.50 (£292.86, 354.33 euros) from $268.50 for 1,000 cubic metres. The increase comes amid tense diplomatic relations following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula. 'Unacceptable' Mr Yatsenyuk said Russia was trying to punish the new leaders in Kiev after last month's removal of the Moscow-backed government of President Viktor Yanukovych. ""Political pressure is unacceptable, and we are not accepting the price of $500,"" Mr Yatsenyuk told ministers on Saturday. ""Russia was unable to seize Ukraine by means of military aggression. Now they are implementing plans to seize Ukraine through economic aggression."" The prime minister said the price Russia was demanding was the highest in Europe, and that Ukraine was prepared to continue to buy at the previous rate of $268.50. Energy minister Yuriy Prodan said that if no deal was reached, Ukraine would take action at an arbitration court in Stockholm. ""We are not trying to break our contract but to set up a fair price,"" he said, adding that that Ukrainians should prepare for the possibility of supplies to be cut off. The price increase could also affect gas supplies to Europe, as 40% of Russian gas to the continent travels through Ukraine, says the BBC's David Stern in Kiev. Mr Prodan has said Ukraine would meet its commitments to supply gas to Europe no matter what happened. 'On the edge' Gazprom says Ukraine's gas debts to Russia stand at just over $1.7bn (£1.02bn). Russia has increasingly pressured Ukraine over its debts since the ousting of President Yanukovych in February. He was removed after months of pro-EU protests. The price increase marks the end of a discount Russia agreed to give Ukraine in December after talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Yanukovych. Ukraine's interim government said last month it would raise gas prices for domestic consumers by 50% to secure an International Monetary Fund (IMF) aid package. The IMF has made subsidy reform a condition of its deal worth as much as $18bn. Mr Yatsenyuk earlier told parliament the country was ""on the edge of economic and financial bankruptcy"".",Ukraine has rejected moves by Russia to almost double the price of Russian gas supplies to the country and threatened legal action.
"By Andrew BomfordBBC Radio 4's PM programme Young people bore the brunt of the financial crisis, with almost a quarter (22.5%) unemployed in 2011. Since then the rate has fallen, and Thursday's Labour Market statistics show 16% of 16-24 year olds are unemployed. However the numbers of young people out of work is still significantly higher than the 6% rate for the working population as a whole. Ben began a new position as an apprentice hairdresser this week at a men's barbers in Basildon. He had already completed an NVQ in women's hairdressing at college, but decided that he preferred to cut men's hair. ""I took an apprenticeship because I felt it was a better way of learning, because you get people skills at the same time,"" he says, ""and you get paid to learn as well."" However, the pay is low. Ben is earning the national minimum wage for apprentices, which is £2.73 per hour. He is expected to complete at least 12 months training, which includes a day release course at college. By the end of the course he will have achieved another NVQ, in barbering. An NVQ is considered equivalent to five GCSEs. His boss, Matt Perham, who runs Rusty's Barbershop in Basildon, gets £1,500 from the government scheme, to cover some of his wages. ""I like employing apprentices because you can train them up exactly to your standards,"" he says, ""Sometimes those with more experience have picked up bad habits, and it's harder to change at that point. I think it's a good way to start out in the business."" Apprenticeships have suffered in the drive to improve academic standards at schools and universities, with the message to young people often being that a university education is all that counts. England lags a long way behind other rich countries in its numbers of apprenticeships, according to a recent report by the think-tank Demos, with 11 apprentices per 1,000 employees, compared to 39 in Australia, 40 in Germany, and 43 in Switzerland. The report estimated that boosting the numbers of apprentices to similar levels would improve Britain's GDP by £4bn a year. A new drive, launched last month, to boost the numbers of apprentices has vastly extended the range of jobs open to apprentices, and the highest level apprentices can go on to achieve the equivalent of a university degree. Some of the most sought after apprenticeships with the top firms pay very well - up to about £25,000. Apprenticeships are now available in careers ranging from advertising, to legal work, to art galleries, and information technology, to name but a few of the 1,200 job roles on offer. Back at the barbers, Ben replaced another apprentice, Ashley Knott, who has been given a permanent job after a year of training. ""I don't think apprentices get the respect they deserve,"" he says. ""For me it's changed my life for the better. Some people see it as cheap labour, making tea and sweeping the floor, but before you know it you're on the shop floor working full-time. I'm really enjoying it."" Andrew Bomford's full report will be broadcast on the PM programme on Thursday 13 November at 17:00 GMT.

"Reports had suggested Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley could block Debenhams attempt to raise cash by selling its department store chain Magasin du Nord. A spokesperson said the suggestion was ""irresponsible and incorrect"". The sportswear giant recently bought House of Fraser and owns 29.7% of Debenhams, prompting speculation of a possible merger between the two chains. Sports Direct's spokesperson said that Sports Direct had discussed ""various opportunities for business collaborations to support Debenhams over the last year or so"", but said Debenhams had ""chosen not to move forward with these proposals, as is their right"". Last week, an outgoing director from Sports Direct suggested the idea of a merger had been discussed at board level before later saying his remarks had been misinterpreted. Sports Direct later issued a formal statement confirming it did not plan to make a bid for Debenhams for six months. Under Takeover Panel rules, the chain is still able to make a bid if there is a ""material change of circumstances"" at Debenhams, with full agreement of the company's board or after a bid from a third party. Debenhams is currently in the midst of a turnaround plan designed to cut costs and boost sales, and confirmed last week that it had appointed consultancy KPMG to help improve its performance. The department store chain has issued three profit warnings this year, and has lost two-thirds of its share price value since January. As part of its cost cutting, Debenhams said in August that 80 to 90 jobs at its headquarters would be shed. That followed a February announcement it was planning to cut 320 store management jobs. The business is also looking at raising cash by selling off its Scandinavian department store chain Magasin du Nord for as much as £200m.",Sports Direct has denied claims that it wants struggling retailer Debenhams to collapse so it can buy it cheaply.
"Prices in shops were 2.9% higher in June compared with a year earlier, the biggest increase since October 2008. In May, the annual increase had been 2.3%. Food prices were up 5.7% from a year ago, compared with May's rate of 4.9%. The BRC added that higher petrol and commodity prices were also driving up overall inflation. The BRC's director general Stephen Robertson said the food price increases were, in part, driven by a mixture of factors outside the UK. ""A weak pound has certainly got a role to play here,"" he told the BBC. ""But on top of that we've seen... droughts, floods and then of course in Russia we've seen some protectionist measures saying we don't want to sell our grain to the rest of the world. ""Put all that together and you're seeing some really quite sharp [price] increases."" Inflation doubts However, Mark Price, chief executive of grocery chain Waitrose, said he didn't ""recognise the inflation data that we are reading about"". He said that Waitrose had seen food price inflation running at 3%, and special offers running in supermarkets brought the rate down even further. Coupled with ""trading down, the real food price inflation is 2.1%"", Mr Price said. Price pressures The BRC predicted that prices could rise further, due to higher grain prices, and also as a result of wage rises in commodity-exporting countries. The group added that shop prices were going up much more slowly than the wider Consumer Prices Index, which currently shows inflation at 4.5%. Consumers were also using promotions and discounts to try to minimise the impact of inflation on their bills, the BRC said, pointing to recent data from research firm Nielsen which showed 39% of all grocery spending was on promoted goods.","Shop prices rose at their highest rate for two and a half years in June, pushed up by soaring food prices, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says."
"By Kabir ChibberBusiness reporter, BBC News The people who assemble most of these iPhones and other bestselling Apple products like the iPad work for Foxconn, a manufacturer owned by the Taiwanese group Hon Hai Precision. For years, Foxconn has remained low-key despite employing 800,000 workers worldwide. Foxconn counts itself as one of a number of ""hidden dragons"" - huge but often obscure companies that manufacture goods, largely in China, for the world's biggest brands in electronics, clothing, toys and home appliances. But scandals over working conditions and the growing visibility of the products it makes have thrust it into the spotlight. Who are Foxconn and what do they do? Biggest Taiwanese firm Foxconn is part of a many-tentacled organisation called Hon Hai Precision, and is the world's largest maker of consumer electronics. For example, Foxconn Technology helps assemble Apple iPhone and iPads. Another subsidiary, Foxconn International, is the world's biggest contract mobile-phone maker and has nothing to do with Apple's flagship products. And Hon Hai works on cutting-edge issues like nanotechnology and material sciences. What is now Foxconn was founded in 1974 with $7,500 (£4,624) that the founder, Terry Gou, borrowed from his mother. The company listed in Taipei in 1991, and now it is currently worth about 1.1tn Taiwanese dollars ($37bn; £23bn). Foxconn is not just used by Apple, but by all the biggest tech companies in the world. Some of its clients include HP, Microsoft, Nokia and Sony. It says it has had 25,000 patents granted worldwide. Mr Gou's firm is one of the biggest exporters out of China. One iPod-making factory in Shenzhen alone has 30,000 workers. 'Clear mind' Mr Gou, who is averse to publicity, is the richest man in Taiwan. He started out by making the buttons on black and white TV sets made by US firms, before moving on to supplying red-hot games maker Atari with connectors for its joysticks. In a rare interview, he describes visiting the US for the first time, renting a limousine to visit the offices of companies like IBM and sleeping in the back of it at night to save money. According to Bloomberg Businessweek, in his office are books containing Mr Gou's words of wisdom, such as ""hungry people have an especially clear mind"". Foxconn is famous for his industrial revolution approach to manufacturing; the workers eat, sleep and live in huge dormitories adjacent to the factories where they work round-the-clock shifts. The company even provides doctors. The plant in Shenzhen, which includes bakeries, banks and acupuncture clinics, for example, employs over 400,000 people. Workers live in a dorm with seven strangers, performing the same task six days a week. Suicide deaths But the gulf between the beauty of the products Foxconn makes and the conditions it takes to make them were exposed quite brutally when a spate of deaths hit the firm. Thirteen Chinese employees committed suicide at Foxconn or related plants in 2010, shining a spotlight on working conditions in China and drawing attention to growing labour strikes. In the same year, Foxconn had to shut down a factory in India temporarily when 250 workers fell sick. And in May 2011, two people were killed after an explosion at a Foxconn plant in Chengdu. Foxconn said its working conditions were not responsible for the death, and was initially dismissive of the suicides. But it soon responded to the worldwide media attention by raising wages, shortened working hours and installed counsellors on site. It also installed suicide nets to factory living-quarters at its Shenzhen factory. And Apple sent independent inspectors from the US Fair Labor Association to audit their facilities, who found ""significant issues"" among working practices there. Apple said it ""fully accepted"" the report's conclusions. Despite being a lightning rod for criticism, Foxconn is regarded as one of China's better employers by many Chinese labour rights groups, paying workers on time and for all the overtime. The starting salary at its Shenzhen plant - which employs the bulk of its workers - is 1,800 yuan, compared with a minimum wage of 1,500 yuan in the city. The monthly wage increases to 2,200 yuan after a probation period, and more if overtime is included. Because of its high-profile link with Apple, the company has come in for greater scrutiny than many others who are in similar export-oriented industries. In 2011, Hon Hai's shares fell 22%. That is on top of its 13% drop from the year before. But its shares are up 27% this year, partially boosted by demand for Apple's latest phone. To cope with rising wages, Foxconn is moving production to China's inland provinces amid double-digit increases in wages in the coastal provinces known as the Pearl River Delta. Will this and its new worker safety measures address the issues behind the continuing worker unrest? Only time with tell.","On the back of the iPhone, it says: ""Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China."""
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The party's manifesto proposes ditching the ""triple lock"", in which the pension is raised in line with the highest of average earnings, prices or 2.5%. From 2020, its plan is to cut the 2.5% element, to leave a ""double lock"". Labour and the Liberal Democrats have vowed to maintain the triple lock throughout the next Parliament. The demise of the triple lock under Conservative plans has long been predicted. However, many pensions commentators say it is political considerations that have determined the timing. Hugh Nolan, president of the Society of Pension Professionals, said: ""Pensioners have been the main beneficiaries of political tinkering with pensions and benefits recently, reflecting the power of the grey vote over unregistered youngsters."" Richard Parkin head of pensions policy at Fidelity International, said that Theresa May was using ""a strong lead in the opinion polls to kill some of the sacred cows of Tory policy for the elderly"". Darren Redmayne, chief executive of Lincoln Pensions, said it was a brave decision to water down the policy alongside changes to social care contributions and winter fuel payment cuts. ""These reforms will all have significant impacts on middle-class pensioners that are traditional Conservative voters,"" he said. Much change? Figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) showed that total pension spending had increased by 25% since 2010-11, compared with a 14% rise in earnings and a 15% rise in prices, prompting the IFS economists to declare that any long-term commitment to the triple-lock would be ""unaffordable"". A recent review by former CBI director-general John Cridland, who was appointed as the government's independent reviewer of state pension age last year, recommended that the triple lock be withdrawn in the next Parliament. All the parties will maintain the triple lock until 2020, and even after that there may be relatively little difference to pension rises whichever party is in power. For example prices, as measured by inflation, are predicted to rise by about 2.3% in the second quarter of 2020, according to the Bank of England - very close to the 2.5% pledge included by Labour and the Lib Dems from 2020. Wage growth is predicted to be more than 3% by 2019, potentially setting the mark for pension rises, although these forecasts are notoriously difficult. ""It is pretty rare for both average earnings and inflation to be below 2.5%. Hence getting rid of the 2.5% element of the triple lock does little to change the projected long-run generosity of the state pension,"" said Carl Emmerson of the IFS. 'Fairness' The divide between the parties' policies does rekindle the debate over the fairness of the state pension, paid to 13 million people, and the level of benefit entitlement for different generations. Tom McPhail, head of policy at Hargreaves Lansdown. said: ""The triple lock has largely done its job in improving pensioner incomes in recent years and protecting the retired population from the effects of the post 2008 recession. A double lock still provides a more robust level of security than is enjoyed by the majority of the working population."" However, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The UK has more than 1.5 million pensioners in poverty. And one of the lowest state pensions in the advanced world. ""The triple lock was meant to restore the state pension after it spent decades falling behind wages. That job isn't finished. This is a bad call.""","Pensions experts say Conservative plans to reduce the generosity of the state pension are a risk, but widely anticipated."
"The cuts come as Sharp reported a net loss of 138.4bn yen ($1.8bn; £1.1bn) for the April to June period. That was up from a 49.3bn yen loss during the same period a year earlier. Sharp said that a ""greater-than-expected"" slowdown in demand from Japan and China, and falling prices had hurt its earnings. The firm also widened its annual loss forecast to 250bn yen, up from its earlier projection of 30bn yen in April. 'Downside risks' Sharp said it expected ""the business environment to remain unpredictable, with increased downside risks"". It added that the risks included ""the possible return of the financial crisis in Europe, the appreciation of the yen, the ongoing deflation and energy supply issues in Japan"". The eurozone is a key market for Japanese exporters and the fear is that as the region's debt crisis spreads to the bigger economies such as Spain, it will cut demand. At the same time, a strong yen also affects firms such as Sharp, making their goods more expensive to foreign buyers and cutting their profits when they repatriate foreign earnings. The yen has risen by more than 6% against the US dollar since mid-March this year. To make matters worse for Japanese firms, domestic demand has not grown enough to offset a decline in foreign sales. Japan has been battling deflation, or falling prices, for many years. While a dip in prices is good for the consumers it can hit the economy and businesses, as buyers tend to put off their purchases in the hope of getting a better deal later on.","Japan's Sharp Corporation, the maker of Aquos TVs, has said it will cut 5,000 jobs, just under 10% of its workforce, in an attempt to cut costs."
"The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), raised concerns about the clarity of fees and the treatment of customers in arrears. It also questioned the way customers were given payment meters to restrict access to TVs. Dunraven Finance will pay £939,000 in compensation. The company, which uses the trading name Buy as You View, will pay an average of nearly £16 per customer, by adjusting bills or in cash payments. It will contact customers directly. Chief executive Graham Clarke said: ""We have worked closely with the FCA in recent months to address these issues and I am sorry to any of our customers who may have experienced difficulties as a result of us not achieving the high standards we set ourselves."" 'Fair treatment' Instead of the current policy of restricting access to the customer's television when payments are not received on time, the company will issue a default notice at least 14 days prior to restrictions. It is also conducting a review of customers who may have been offered more credit than they should have been. The vast majority of customers to receive compensation will do so as a result of fees applied to their accounts for unpaid direct debits since 2001. Jonathan Davidson, from the FCA, said: ""It is important that firms meet our standards, including carrying out proper creditworthiness assessment and making sure that those in difficulty are treated fairly. ""We will continue, when necessary, to take action against inappropriate behaviour.""","Compensation is to be paid to 59,000 customers of Buy as You View, which rents out furniture, TVs and other electronic goods on hire purchase."
"Panorama has seen accounts from 106,000 clients in 203 countries, leaked by whistleblower Herve Falciani in 2007. The documents include details of almost 7,000 clients based in the UK. HSBC admitted that it was ""accountable for past control failures."" But it said it has now ""fundamentally changed"". ""We acknowledge that the compliance culture and standards of due diligence in HSBC's Swiss private bank, as well as the industry in general, were significantly lower than they are today,"" it added. The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina, but not in the UK, where HSBC is based. HSBC said it is ""co-operating with relevant authorities"". Treasury minister David Gauke defended the government's actions on tax avoidance in the House of Commons after Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood Shabana Mahmood tabled an urgent question. He insisted that the Treasury approach has been ""very successful"", saying it has sought prosecution for ""serial tax evaders"" and raised extra tax revenue. Offshore accounts are not illegal, but many people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. And while tax avoidance is perfectly legal, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is not. The French authorities concluded in 2013 that 99.8% of their citizens on the list were probably evading tax. Joint investigation The thousands of pages of data were obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde. In a joint investigation, the documents have now been passed to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian newspaper, Panorama and more than 50 media outlets around the world. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and has identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted. HMRC said £135m in tax, interest and penalties have now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. But the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, said: ""I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, brave enough, tough enough in securing for the British taxpayer the monies that are due."" HSBC did not just turn a blind eye to tax evaders - in some cases it broke the law by actively helping its clients. The bank gave one wealthy family a foreign credit card so they could withdraw their undeclared cash at cashpoints overseas. HSBC also helped its tax-dodging clients stay ahead of the law. When the European Savings Directive was introduced in 2005, the idea was that Swiss banks would take any tax owed from undeclared accounts and pass it to the taxman. It was a tax designed to catch tax evaders. But instead of simply collecting the money, HSBC wrote to customers and offered them ways to get round the new tax. HSBC denies that all these account holders were evading tax. 'Dodge liabilities' Richard Brooks, a former tax inspector and author of The Great Tax Robbery, said: ""I think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that's what they were offering. They knew full well that people come to them to dodge their tax liabilities."" The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative peer and appointed to the government. Lord Green was made a minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013. He told Panorama: ""As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present."" HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers 106,000 clients with Swiss bank accounts 203 countries involved $118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts 11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn 9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn 7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bn Treasury minister David Gauke defended Lord Green's appointment on BBC's Radio 4. ""I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that Lord Green was involved in this sort of activity"", but said he did not know whether anyone asked him about HSBC prior to his government appointment. But Ms Hodge said: ""Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. ""Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer."" Verbal messages Meanwhile, HSBC said it has completely overhauled its private banking business and has reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70% since 2007. In a statement, the bank said: ""HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money."" The bank said it now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability. But Panorama has spoken to a whistleblower who said there were still problems with tax dodging at HSBC private bank when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg. She said HSBC did not keep its promise to change. ""I think the verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice and that disturbed me greatly,"" she said. It was her job to make sure HSBC followed the rules, but she said she was sacked after raising concerns. She has since won a tribunal hearing for unfair dismissal.

"Prime Minister Tony Abbott said the country had been talking to China about how the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) would be governed. He added that a decision will be made ""in the next few days"". Britain, France and Germany have also announced plans to join the new Beijing-based lender, which is seen as a rival to the World Bank. However, that has drawn concern from the US, which sees the AIIB as a tool which China can use to extend its political influence. Washington has also said the new lender needs to meet international governance and other standards. ""We have been talking to the Chinese to try to ensure that it is in fact a multilateral institution, that it is run in all important respects by a board, that its processes are transparent, that it is genuinely accountable and that it is not controlled by any one entity,"" Mr Abbott told Australia's parliament. The AIIB has more than 30 members and countries have until the end of March to decide whether or not they would seek membership. The institution will have about $50bn (£34bn) in initial funds that will be disbursed to help address the region's growing demand for roads, ports and other infrastructure facilities.","Australia said its ""prepared to join"" a new China-led infrastructure bank should certain conditions be met."
"Executives at Fuller's, Carlsberg UK, Greene King, and Heineken UK are among more than 50 signatories of a letter warning of huge job losses. They call on him to publish the evidence justifying the coronavirus restrictions on the industry. A Downing Street spokesperson said they would respond in due course. The letter says: ""The pub is clearly being singled out for exceptionally harsh and unjustified treatment and unless your government changes course, and soon, huge portions of this most British of institutions will simply not be there come the spring. ""We believe it is in the interests of openness and transparency that any evidence showing pubs to be the source of outbreaks of the virus, and thereby justifying these extra restrictions, must be published immediately."" The letter comes ahead of a planned announcement on Thursday that could see two-thirds of the country placed into tiers two or three when the current lockdown lifts next month. Pubs in tier two areas will be able to serve drinks only to customers having a substantial meal, and those in tier three will not be able to open. Pubs, and the hospitality industry generally, have been among the hardest-hit sectors during lockdown. More than a third of hospitality firms say they have little or no confidence of surviving the next three months, according to data collected by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) earlier this month. Other signatories to the letter include executives at Adnams, Marston's, Budweiser UK, Punch Pubs, Shepherd Neame and Young's. They tell the PM they employ ""hundreds of thousands of people and contribute billions of pounds of economic value to the UK economy - all of this is at risk today"". ""Your Winter Plan, compounded by the Christmas announcement, have been greeted with utter dismay and incredulity by publicans up and down the country, and made the situation facing us exponentially worse,"" they say. ""How can it be that people mixing in unregulated private homes is deemed safer than gathering in limited numbers in larger, regulated and ultimately Covid-secure venues like pubs? There is no logic to this decision. ""It is clear that pubs are being scapegoated despite a lack of available evidence that they are any more responsible for outbreaks than other types of venue. We cannot stand idly by and allow these measures to destroy our businesses."" If restrictions cannot be relaxed, the pubs are demanding, among other things, financial support in line with the first lockdown, immediate changes to business rates, and a cut in the ""punitively high"" beer duty rate.","Britain's major pub groups and brewers have pleaded with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to save an industry facing the ""darkest of moments""."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The chancellor has announced plans on tax, housing and travel, alongside an update on the UK's economic position. Here is what it means for you. Stamp duty reform The stand out feature of the Budget for first-time buyers living in England, Northern Ireland and, for a time, in Wales is an immediate abolition of stamp duty when buying properties of up to £300,000. For properties costing up to £500,000, no stamp duty will be paid on the first £300,000. The starting point for paying stamp duty in England was £125,000. According to the Halifax, the average first-time buyer in the UK had paid about £1,660 in stamp duty, on a property costing £211,980. However, in many parts of the country first-time buyers pay relatively little in stamp duty. In the North of England, the typical first-time buyer saving would be £24, the lender said. The effect will be felt the most in the South East of England where the average home bought by a first-time buyer could save £3,948, and in London with a saving of £5,000. The Office For Budget Responsibility also pointed out that a subsequent rise in house prices would more than cancel out the benefit from the stamp duty measures, and it will primarily assist existing homeowners, with only an additional 3,500 first-time buyer sales at a significant cost to the Treasury. It does not affect the biggest up-front cost for first-time buyers - the deposit. In the UK, the average deposit is £37,101, according to the Halifax. If a couple are buying and only one is a first-time buyer, then they do not get the tax break. It also will do nothing for those trading up, whose numbers have fallen sharply in the last 10 years, or potential downsizers who are put off by the stamp duty cost. Housing is a devolved issue, so there are different rules in the different nations. In Scotland, the equivalent tax is called Land and Buildings Transaction Tax. Here the tax is levied on buyers purchasing homes costing more than £145,000 - the same as the average house price for all buyers. New rates have already been set in Wales for next April, with a starting point tax of 2.5% on properties of more than £150,000. The average home in Wales cost £153,000 in September, official figures show. The changes announced in the Budget will take effect until then. Scotland and Wales will need to decide whether they follow this measure in England. Northern Ireland, which has the same stamp duty rates as England, has an average house price of £132,000. Mr Hammond announced measures that he said would see 300,000 new homes built a year by the mid-2020s. He had signalled this change earlier in the week. Local authorities will be able to increase the council tax premium on empty homes from 50% to 100% ""to encourage owners of empty homes to bring their properties back into use"". Earn more before you are taxed At present 31 million people pay income tax in the UK. Nearly 26 million of those pay at the basic rate. The amount earned before income tax is paid - called the personal allowance - will rise from £11,500 to £11,850 in April. This will cut less than £100 a year off a basic rate taxpayer's annual bill. It was a Conservative manifesto pledge to increase the personal allowance to £12,500 by 2020-21. The higher rate is paid by 5.2 million people. The threshold will rise from £45,000 to £46,350. The government has already pledged to increase this to £50,000 by 2020-21. The threshold is different in Scotland (owing to devolved powers) where it is £43,000. The Scottish government will announce its intentions for these rates in December. Bowing to pressure on Universal Credit Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people, replacing six benefits and merging them into one payment. They are Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related employment and support allowance, Housing Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit. Currently people typically have to wait six weeks for their first payment and one in five wait longer. The chancellor announced various measures to tackle some of the issues raised in a concerted campaign from charities and many MPs. This is likely to cut a week off this wait. New Universal Credit claimants in receipt of Housing Benefit will now continue to receive it for two weeks. Beer and cigarettes The duty on beer, cider and spirits has been frozen this time, although there will be an increase on some high-strength drinks, including some white ciders. There was a 2p increase on a pint of beer and 1p increase in cider announced in the Spring Budget. A bottle of Scotch whisky was increased by 36p in March. The chancellor has now announced an additional duty on hand-rolling tobacco, on top of the previously announced inflation plus 2% rise in tobacco duty which would push up the cost of a packet of 20 cigarettes by 28p. What changes for drivers? Fuel duty has been frozen again, a move that will be welcomed by many drivers. Many drivers of new diesel cars will see an increase in the road tax they pay in the first year of owning their car from April. They will be levied on one band higher than those with petrol cars, owing to the environmental effect of this type of fuel. This will amount to only about £20 for smaller cars, and £300 for larger cars, Treasury figures show. At present, there is a sliding scale of charges for the first year of ownership and after that petrol or diesel vehicles are subject to a ""standard"" rate of £140 a year. Only those diesel vehicles that do not meet the very latest European emissions standards will be affected. The existing diesel supplement in company car tax is also going up, and there will be less of a tax impact for those who charge up their electric car at work, Millennial travel card The government has said people up to 30 years-old will be able to buy a £30 railcard for discounted train travel from next spring - an extension of the current young person's railcard for those aged 16 to 25. The so called millennials' card will be available from spring next year, and offer up to a third off non-peak fares, which usually apply on services after 10am. State pension increase The 3% rise in the state pension in April has been confirmed, amounting to £3.65 extra a week. As is usually the case, this is in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living, in September. What we already knew Changes already earmarked for next April and subsequent financial years include:","A Budget has been delivered by Chancellor Philip Hammond which he says will ""help families to cope with the cost of living""."
"By Matthew WallTechnology of Business editor At the recent AI for Good Summit in Geneva, Switzerland, we were told how AI could speed up the development of new drugs, lead to personalised medicine informed by our genomes, and help diagnose diseases in countries suffering from underdeveloped health services and a chronic shortage of doctors. But there are two main obstacles preventing access to this utopian destination. One is that the AI being applied to the world's health problems isn't quite good enough yet. The other related issue is the lack of good quality digital data - less than 20% of the world's medical data is available in a form that AI machine learning algorithms can ingest and learn from, the WHO estimates. As populations grow and age, more pressure is being put on doctors who are struggling to cope with the increase in administration that comes with more patients wanting to be seen more often. And in emerging economies, there simply aren't enough doctors to go around. So many companies have been developing health advice and symptom checker apps as a way of filling the gap. ""Studies in the UK have found that 20% of people who go to the doctor don't really need to be there - the appointments are for minor ailments and injuries that could have been sorted by other means,"" explains Jonathon Carr-Brown, head of partnerships for Your.MD, a health information and symptom checker app. But the rise of such apps has caused concern among health professionals. Last year, for example, Babylon, the company behind the UK's National Health Service app GP at Hand, caused a row by claiming its AI-powered chatbot was as good as a doctor - a claim that was disputed. This is perhaps why companies like Microsoft, which has developed a chatbot or ""virtual assistant"" specifically for the healthcare sector, are being careful not to exaggerate the abilities of their creations. ""It's certainly not a replacement for your doctor, more of a support,"" explains Hadas Bitran, head of Microsoft Healthcare Israel. ""We want to help doctors decide who they need to help first. It's like a rule-based textbook for triage."" The chatbot comes equipped with medical content provided by trusted third parties, general symptoms checking capability, and natural language processing that can discern whether or not a patient is upset. If it detects heightened emotion it will refer the case to a human, says Ms Bitran. Your.MD's Mr Carr-Brown also emphasises that his firm's app is not a replacement for a doctor. ""Just because AI can diagnose, that doesn't mean it should always do it. We need to focus on next steps advice rather than diagnosis, so we're moving to being more of a guide and companion."" It's a telling admission. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, the World Health Organisation's (WHO) first chief scientist, believes there should be a global governance framework for AI in health. Indeed, the WHO and the International Telecommunications Union (hosts of the AI for Good Summit) have set up a joint focus group to look at how standards for AI in healthcare could be established. ""There is a risk that unevaluated apps could end up doing more harm than good,"" she warns. But in emerging markets, where there are fewer doctors to go around, such virtual assistants and AI-powered apps could provide remote care, linking people up to doctors via video link and providing initial diagnoses, argues Ms Bitran, thereby preventing many wasted journeys over long distances. More Technology of Business ""830 women are lost every day to problems in pregnancy and child birth, 90% in sub-Saharan Africa,"" says Alvin Kabwama, head of applied machine learning at Cognitive AI Tech Limited. ""They don't get access to essential urine tests other mothers get routinely in other parts of the world."" Sometimes the women have to walk 27km to the nearest health centre - a journey of five hours. ""If she arrives late and the doctors have left, she has to walk back home,"" he says. So in remote areas, smartphones are increasingly being used as diagnostic tools, testing eyes, ears, skin conditions and so on, and AI-powered machines are speeding up the diagnosis of urine and blood samples. However, AI needs vast amounts of data to learn from and electronic health records are not the norm in many countries, making AI analysis even more difficult. ""In Senegal there is still a big reliance on paper forms that are often incomplete or illegible,"" says Ibrahima Khaliloulah, a doctor working in the country. ""Full electronic health records are essential, a goal Senegal hopes to achieve by 2030."" But even in developed countries, lack of access to digital health data is a big problem. ""Health data is a public good, but people have to trust the WHO and governments that it won't be used for commercial reasons without their consent or to discriminate against people,"" says the WHO's Soumya Swaminathan And this is the dilemma. People are particularly sensitive about sharing health data - even in anonymised form - yet AI needs as much data as possible to spot patterns humans can't, diagnose diseases more accurately, and target treatments more effectively. AI is good at finding molecules with the potential to be developed into drugs, but these eventually have to be tested on humans in clinical trials, and finding suitable candidates is hugely expensive and time-consuming. ""About 80% of trials fail to meet their deadlines because they couldn't find suitable patients in time,"" says Microsoft's Ms Bitran, ""and half never meet their recruitment targets"". Huge global databases of anonymised health data could help match patients with clinical trial requirements much more efficiently, thereby speeding up how quickly potentially life-saving drugs come to market. So to maximise the undoubted benefits of AI in healthcare, we need to digitise as much health data as possible and persuade the world to share this data for the good of all.","From automated eye scans to analysing the cries of new-born babies, faster drug development to personalised medicine, artificial intelligence (AI) promises huge advances in the field of healthcare. But major challenges remain."
"By Howard MustoeBusiness reporter The Marmite maker rejected the US food giant's bid on Friday, saying it saw ""no merit, either financial or strategic"" in Kraft's offer, worth about $143bn (£115bn). ""Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard,"" the companies said in a joint statement. Shares in Unilever, which closed 13% higher on Friday, fell 7.3% in lunchtime trading in London to £35.18. Kraft's offer had been at an 18% premium to Unilever's closing share price on Thursday. Kraft shares rose 11% on Wall Street on Friday. George Salmon, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said shelving the deal just one business day after it was announced came as a surprise. ""It was always going to be a difficult pitch to convince shareholders to relinquish their grip on Unilever, given the expectations for the company to keep churning out resilient growth in the years to come,"" he said. The deal would have been one of the biggest in corporate history, combining dozens of household names. Unilever owns Ben & Jerry's ice cream, Dove soap, and Hellmann's mayonnaise, while Kraft's range includes Philadelphia cheese and Heinz baked beans. ""It would appear that Kraft Heinz have underestimated both the intrinsic value of Unilever and the challenge of acquiring control of a Dutch company whose stakeholders would have opposed such a move vociferously,"" said Martin Deboo, a Jefferies International analyst. More than half of the company's shares are in the Dutch-listed entity, he told the BBC. 'Friendly basis' Michael Mullen, a Kraft Heinz spokesman, said its interest was made public at an extremely early stage. ""Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value,"" he said. Reports suggested that Prime Minister Theresa May had asked officials to examine the deal before it was scrapped. However, her spokesman said on Monday that Downing Street was not involved in Kraft's decision to withdraw the offer. The takeover of Cadbury by Kraft in 2010 was controversial enough to prompt a revamp of the rules governing how foreign firms buy UK companies. Just a week after promising to keep open Cadbury's Somerdale factory, near Bristol, Kraft backtracked and said it would close the plant. The Takeover Panel reviewed the laws and, in September 2011, strengthened the hand of target companies, and demanded more information from bidders about their intentions after the purchase, particularly on areas such as job cuts. In July last year, shortly after becoming prime minister, Mrs May promised to have a ""proper industrial strategy"" that could be used to block takeovers. Analysis By Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent Kraft Heinz is jointly controlled by billionaire investor Warren Buffett and Brazilian private equity group 3G. The latter has a deserved reputation for taking a scythe to costs - irrespective of how that might impact jobs and factories. Unilever, on the other hand, has a reputation for doing the right thing in terms of corporate social responsibility and the environment - even if that eats into the bottom line. I understand that Kraft Heinz was shocked with the vehemence with which its ""friendly"" merger offer was rebuffed. The bosses of both consumer giants spoke over the weekend and it was clear that if Kraft really wanted Unilever it would have to launch a hostile takeover bid that could have ended up being very expensive. The higher the price, the less worthwhile the deal. So the bid was withdrawn within 55 hours of it being announced. Unilever clashed with UK supermarket Tesco in October over its attempts to raise prices to compensate for the steep drop in the value of the pound. The consumer goods giant has over a dozen sites across the UK, including three major plants in Liverpool, Norwich and Gloucester. If the deal had proceeded, it would be the second biggest ever, behind Vodafone's $183bn takeover of Germany's Mannesmann in 2000, according to Dealogic.","Kraft Heinz has abandoned its offer to buy Unilever, its Anglo-Dutch rival."
"The supermarket giant was one of nine firms facing penalties totalling close to £50m for colluding over the price of milk and cheese in 2002 and 2003. But Tesco expressed ""surprise and dismay"" that it was included in the penalties handed down by the regulator. Tesco denies it colluded with others. The OFT estimated that the collusion saw shoppers pay 2 pence extra for a litre of milk and 2p extra on 100g of cheese. The regulator originally calculated that an extra £270m was spent by UK consumers as a result of the price fixing, but no total figure has been included in the final report. Fines reduced The OFT found that Arla, Asda, Dairy Crest, McLelland, Safeway, Sainsbury's, The Cheese Company, Wiseman, and Tesco infringed the Competition Act by co-ordinating rises in the prices consumers paid for certain dairy products in 2002 and, or 2003. The first eight all received leniency after admitting liability. However, Tesco has denied collusion and said it would defend its position vigorously, and ""through the courts if necessary"". ""We surely have now reached the stage where the absurdity of the OFT operating as investigator, prosecutor and judge cannot be allowed to continue,"" said Lucy Neville-Rolfe, Tesco's director of corporate and legal affairs. Tesco's share price was down slightly at 1100BST on Wednesday, as was Morrisons' - the owner of Safeway. Fines were originally set at a total of £116m, but were reduced after consultation. For example Wiseman said it had originally reached a settlement of £6.1m with the OFT. This sum was reduced to £4.2m in March 2010, and is now down to £3.2m. The OFT said that supermarkets had indirectly exchanged pricing details with each other via the dairy processors. However, it said that not all the companies were involved in all the infringements that it had found. The final penalties announced by the OFT were £9.39m for Asda, £7.14m for Dairy Crest, £1.66m for McLelland, £5.69m for Safeway, £11.04m for Sainsbury's, £1.26m for The Cheese Company, £3.2m for Wiseman and £10.43m for Tesco. Although Arla was found to been involved in the infringement regarding milk in 2003, it has not been fined as it alerted the OFT to price fixing and was given immunity. ""Competition in the supermarket sector is generally intense and has delivered significant benefits to shoppers across the UK in terms of innovation, choice and improved value for money,"" said OFT chief executive John Fingleton. ""Our investigation and this final decision will help ensure that this competition is maintained.""",Tesco has threatened legal action after being hit with a £10m fine from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) following an inquiry into the price fixing of dairy products.
"The merger would see Cheil Industries, a Samsung de-facto holding company, take over its sister firm, construction group Samsung C&T. The US activist fund has argued the merger is not in the best interests of Samsung C&T's shareholders. Elliot holds 7.1% of Samsung C&T. Samsung is the largest of South Korea's chaebols - huge family-run conglomerates. Other chaebols in South Korea include Hyundai and LG. Elliot has also said the multi billion-dollar merger between Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T would give an unfair advantage to Samsung Group's Lee family - the nation's most powerful corporate name. Samsung Electronics' vice-chairman and Samsung Group's heir apparent, Lee Jae-yong, is the major shareholder in Cheil Industries. Analysts have said the motivation behind the proposed merger is likely to be the Lee family's efforts to ensure it stays in control of Samsung amid a generational changeover of power. The shareholder vote on the merger is set for 17 July.",A court in South Korea has rejected an attempt by US activist investor fund Elliot to stop a shareholder vote on a proposed $8bn merger of two key Samsung Group firms.
"On Sunday, Toshiba said it would raise $5.4bn (£4.1bn) from new shares to plug a hole in its balance sheet left by its bankrupt US nuclear unit. The TSE's rules require the delisting of any company with a negative net worth for two consecutive years. Toshiba needs a positive net worth before the delisting deadline in March. The share sale is a short-term fix aimed at retaining the listing while a much bigger deal goes through. Toshiba agreed in September to sell its chip unit to a group led by Bain Capital for $18bn. The sale would easily cover Toshiba's shortfall, but lengthy regulatory reviews mean the deal might not close before the deadline. Toshiba needs to raise at least $6.7bn by March to avoid being delisted. The share sale itself falls short of that number, but the company said it will also book losses that will allow tax write-offs, taking the total number to $7.5bn. The share sale amounts to roughly half the company's current market value. The new shares will be allotted to 60 overseas investment funds, with each share priced at a 10% discount from Friday's closing price.",Toshiba shares fell nearly 5% on Monday after the company announced a plan to help it retain its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).
"The banking system was saved from collapse by billions of pounds of taxpayers' money, which in turn led to anger that the public was having to bail out bankers, who were perceived as risk-taking and ""greedy"". People wanted to see bosses held to account and a system introduced which would ensure this could not happen again. So what has actually changed? Pay and bonuses Banks came under fire from taxpayers, shareholders and regulators over their pay policies, with bumper bonuses seen as ""reward for failure"". In December 2010, European regulators announced tough restrictions on the bonuses that banks can pay their staff. The rules meant that bankers could receive only 20-30% of their bonuses in immediate cash. The guidelines required banks to defer 40-60% of bonuses for three to five years and pay 50% of bonuses in shares (rather than cash), set a maximum bonus level as a percentage of an individual's basic pay, and publish pay details for ""senior management and risk takers"". Regulators have also encouraged banks to ""claw back"" pay - reclaiming compensation if an individual's performance is later not deemed worthy of the pay. Several banks have said they have done this or are considering doing so. Lloyds has cut £2m from bonuses paid to 13 executives, including former chief executive Eric Daniels, for the bank's mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). JP Morgan has said it will claw back as much remuneration as possible from the individuals deemed responsible for losses of $5.8bn (£3.7bn) from trading in complex financial derivatives. This would amount to about two years' worth of pay for each individual. Bank levy In June 2010, the chancellor announced that banks operating in the UK would be hit with a levy - an annual tax on their balance sheets - in a joint move between the UK, France and Germany. The idea was to raise more than £8bn for the Treasury over four years, with Mr Osborne saying that since the financial crisis began in banking, it was ""fair and right"" that banks should contribute to the economic recovery. The government also hoped it would discourage banks from relying on risky forms of borrowing, which were blamed for making the financial crisis much more dangerous. The levy was originally brought in as a temporary measure in January 2011 and was set at 0.04%. But since then it has been made permanent and at the beginning of 2012 was increased to 0.088%. The levy does not affect smaller banks and building societies, and certain items are exempt, including ordinary deposits covered by the UK's deposit insurance scheme. Who pays if a bank fails The government set up the Independent Commission on Banking, led by Sir John Vickers, with the aim of making the UK banking system safer. Its big idea was to set up a ring-fence to separate their retail operations from their riskier investment banking. The retail bank businesses should have their own financial cushions, so that they can carry on independently in case something goes wrong with the rest of a bank's operations. Following the Vickers recommendations, the government drafted a bill on bank reforms, the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill. After criticism from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, a panel of MPs and peers led by Andrew Tyrie, that plans to ring-fence the banks ""fell well short of what is required"", the government agreed to ""electrify"" the ring-fence. This means that a bank that fails to separate its investment and retail arms would be broken up. As well as ring-fencing, the bill wants to rank retail deposits (but not pension liabilities) ahead of the claims of other bank creditors in the event of a bank insolvency. It also wants banks to hold a sufficient capital buffer so that if they do fail, losses can be absorbed. The bill has now gone before Parliament. Regulation Significant changes to the regulatory system of the UK's financial sector have been announced over the past couple of years. The Financial Services Act will replace the current Tripartite structure, introduced by the previous Labour government, and made up of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the Treasury and the Bank of England. The Bank of England is responsible for keeping an eye on the money markets, the FSA supervises the individual banks and looks after the interests of consumers, while the Treasury provides the public money for this. Critics say the system did not make clear who would be in charge in a crisis and the tripartite authorities needed to communicate better with each other. In the overhaul, the FSA will be abolished, and three new bodies created, the first two within the Bank of England, to regulate financial services: Savings protection Ordinary people who have savings have long been protected from losing their money if their bank goes bust. But since the onset of the crisis, the level of protection has more than doubled. In 2007 the maximum payout for depositors was just £31,700 per person. Now it is £85,000, under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Vetting executives The FSA has moved to scrutinise more thoroughly banks' appointments of chief executives and board members in recent years. The regulator has to approve anyone wanting to serve in ""significant influence functions"" (SIF) at financial companies. It now uses formal panels to interview many would-be top executives. Former FSA chief executive Hector Sants has admitted that prior to the crisis the FSA did not do enough to assess the suitability of candidates or to look at the blend of individuals on a board. Over the last two years, 39 SIF applications were withdrawn ""demonstrably due to serious concerns identified by the FSA interview panel"". Once the FSA is replaced under the new regulatory system, the Financial Conduct Authority will be involved in SIF interviews and will have the right to veto individuals.","Five years on from the start of the credit crunch, the financial sector is now under more scrutiny than ever."
"In China, the authorities intervened again on the stock market to little effect. Shares in Shanghai fell 3.4%. And expectations of a US interest rate rise dimmed after the Federal Reserve said the economy was not ready yet. In the US, the Dow Jones closed down more than 2%, while markets in Paris and Frankfurt also fell more than 2%. The UK's FTSE 100 closed down 0.56%. Oil prices had a mixed day. After dropping at first - adding to steep falls seen on Wednesday - US crude recovered to stand up 20 cents at $41.47 a barrel, although Brent crude was down 54 cents at $46.62. China fears Markets have become increasingly nervous over prospects for the global economy, especially with signs that the Chinese economy is slowing. The devaluation of China's currency, the yuan, last week took many by surprise, and the Chinese stock market has continued to see big fluctuations despite efforts by Beijing to calm markets. On Thursday, Chinese shares fell again, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index closing 3.4% lower at 3,664.29. On Wednesday, minutes from last month's meeting of the US Federal Reserve flagged up China as a potential problem, saying that a ""material slowdown"" in the Chinese economy could affect the US economic outlook. The US central bank's meeting came before last week's action by China to weaken its currency. ""The Chinese slowdown is hugely important for the global economy and we can see the impact of this slowly spreading across East Asia, the commodity producers and now reaching a wider set of countries,"" Lord Turner, the former chairman of the Financial Services Authority, told the BBC. ""I think what is going on in the industrial sectors of the economy, they maybe actually in recession and the official figures that show there is 7% growth - I think they are simply not credible."" US rates The Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been kept near zero since December 2008, although there has been speculation that the Fed will raise rates at its meeting in September. The latest minutes from the Fed were seen as giving little direction as to whether a rate rise in September was on the cards. They showed that most policymakers thought conditions for a US rate rise ""were approaching"", but the economy was not ready yet. There was also concern that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices, which act as a double depressant on imports. Lord Turner said that a rise in US interest rates and the dollar would have a ""large impact"" on emerging markets, especially corporate borrowers, who have borrowed in dollars. ""I think as long as we only see a small increase in US interest rates that's not too big an impact, but if there was a 1% or 2% increase over a short period of time, that would be a major shock to the world economy."" Lord Turner said he did not believe there was a risk of another financial crisis similar to the one in 2008 because the banking system was more robust, but he feared there were unresolved imbalances in the global economy. Currency moves Although oil prices appeared to stabilise on Thursday, they had fallen sharply on Wednesday following the release of data showing that US oil stockpiles were higher than expected. The price of oil has more than halved over the past year, due to a combination of increased supplies and slowing demand. The low oil prices are creating pressures on economies that are dependent on oil revenues. Among them is energy-rich Kazakhstan, the biggest economy of Central Asia, which has announced it is floating its currency, the Tenge. As a result, the Tenge dropped by almost a quarter in one day. Other emerging market currencies also came under pressure on Thursday, with the Turkish lira briefly touching a record low of 3.0 to the US dollar.","Shares around the world have seen further falls, sparked by renewed fears over the health of the global economy."
"By Jonty BloomBusiness correspondent, BBC News It has been long assumed that he was using the position, and his ability to promote his supporters, as the launch pad for a move from No 11 to No 10 Downing Street - just as Gordon Brown did. The referendum result changed all that. His lead role in campaigning against Brexit, with dire warnings about the economic consequences of a vote to leave the EU, pulled the rug from under his own feet. It seems clear that his previous insistence on austerity does not sit well with new Prime Minister Theresa May's ideas. Her campaign speech on Monday was probably the death sentence for Mr Osborne's political career. ""We need an economy that works for everyone,"" she said. ""It is apparent to anybody who is in touch with the real world that people do not feel our economy works that way at all."" But how will his six years in the number two job of British politics be remembered? Growth Well, George Osborne inherited an economy that had suffered its worst recession in decades and a massive level of government borrowing. His response was to try to slash government spending and raise taxes to bring the deficit down. Even now, some economists think this was the wrong policy and prolonged the downturn, or at least slowed the recovery. But the chancellor stuck to his guns and his greatest triumph was that he won that argument, and was able to steer a new course for the British economy as a result. Growth has been steady and unemployment fell dramatically, all while reducing the size of the civil service and many departmental budgets dramatically. George Osborne also pushed the government's agenda of a ""Northern Powerhouse"", trying to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and exports and reverse the dominance of London and the South East. But over the years the chancellor has had to soften his fiscal plans. First, Mr Osborne wanted to balance the budget by 2015, then 2017, 2019 and finally 2020. He used those promises to maintain the confidence of the markets and to outmanoeuvre Labour, but never hit any of them. Now, with the expected downturn of the economy after the Brexit vote, he has abandoned them altogether. Having been told for six years that there was ""no alternative"" it seems there is; to borrow more for longer and to extend austerity for years to come. 'Omnishambles' Austerity is not dead, nor is the commitment to reduce government spending. It is just that the austerity will have to last much longer and the government will have to borrow even more in the meantime. For a supposedly slick political operator, some of his Budgets have been messy, not least his 2012 effort dubbed an ""omnishambles Budget"" by the then Labour leader, Ed Miliband. The chancellor cut the top rate of tax from 50% to 45% and tried to tax heated Cornish pasties and other hot snacks - the so-called ""pasty tax"". The reception of his Budget this year was not much better, with cuts to disability benefits which led to the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith. Eight years after the credit crunch, we still have interest rates at record lows, quantitative easing, massive borrowing, low productivity growth and now another downturn on the cards. But perhaps the greatest problem that Mr Osborne found after all those years of austerity, was that it was the most vulnerable who felt they were hit the hardest. They decided that the economy was not working for them. They did not believe Mr Osborne's warnings about what Brexit might mean, and voted to leave the EU against his advice.","George Osborne has now returned to the back benches, a stunning fall for a man who only ever had one Cabinet post, chancellor of the Exchequer. He had been in charge of the nation's finances since 2010"

We are already preparing a ballot for industrial action in light of the threatened job cuts. ""It is clear that this franchise is being let on pure McNulty terms with a gold-plated, extended contract linked to massive cuts to jobs and passenger services and huge increases in fares as the winning FirstGroup looks to extract every penny that they can in profit. ""RMT will work with MPs and communities along the West Coast route to stop the savage assault on staffing levels and budgets that we expect to be at the core of this new franchise arrangement. ""The new First West Coast deal in an exercise in casino franchising that lays bare the whole sordid enterprise which is rail privatisation. Companies promise the earth, jack up fares and slash jobs and services in a drive for profits, and if the numbers don't stack up, they throw back the keys and expect the public sector to pick up the pieces. ""First pulled the pin on the Great Western route to dodge £800m in payments due to the British taxpayer and here they are just months later in control of the West Coast InterCity route. The highly-political award of this contract turns the UK rail industry into a global laughing stock and the British taxpayer will be rightly outraged."" David Sidebottom, passenger director at Passenger Focus ""For the passengers making their way from London to Manchester or Glasgow, the important thing is not the name on the side of the train, but the experience of the journey, the availability of staff when you need them and of course, the value for money. ""We welcomed the suggestion that passenger satisfaction targets could be included in the franchise, which would help us and passengers to hold the franchisee to account. ""We will now be reviewing the details to see exactly what passengers on this line can expect. ""With another above-inflation fare rise on the horizon, now more than ever, passengers will be looking for value, especially in terms of getting a seat and being on time.""","Virgin Rail has lost its bid to continue running the West Coast Mainline and will be replaced by the UK's largest rail operator, FirstGroup."
"Opec's secretary general Abdallah Salem el-Badri said they would not try to shore up prices by reducing production. ""There's a price decline. That does not mean that we should really rush and do something,"" he said. Following the announcement Brent crude hit its lowest since August 2010, falling below $72 a barrel, before settling at $72.82, 5% drop on the day. The US benchmark dropped $4.64 to $69.05 a barrel, although market business slowed by midday in thinning Thanksgiving holiday business. The 12 Opec members decided to maintain production at 30 million barrels per day as first agreed in December 2011. ""We don't want to panic. I mean it,"" said Mr el-Badri. ""We want to see the market, how the market behaves, because the decline of the price does not reflect a fundamental change."" Crude oil prices have fallen 30% since June on sluggish global demand and rising production from the US. The fall in the oil price has been causing concern for several members of the oil cartel, as most require a price above $80 a barrel to balance their government budgets and many need prices to be above $100 a barrel. ""Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states can resist for a while,"" said Simon Wardell, energy expert at Global Insight. ""They have significant financial assets that mean they can sustain a lower oil price. They can secure their budgets without a higher oil price."" Saudi Arabia is the largest producer within the Opec oil producing cartel. Analysis: Andrew Walker, Economics Correspondent in Vienna The markets didn't expect OPEC to do much at this meeting. Analysts here thought they might manage a resounding commitment to curb the excess production above the existing ceiling. But the group didn't even do that. Looking ahead the OPEC secretariat forecast non-OPEC supply next year to grow by more than the demand for oil. That would squeeze the group even more, and aggravate the downward pressure on prices. Good news for OPEC's customers but very bad news for the more hard-pressed of its members - including Iran, Venezuela and Nigeria. But even for those like Saudi Arabia that can manage at current prices, there comes a point below which even they will start to get uncomfortable. So it will be no great surprise if we are back here in Vienna for an extra, unplanned meeting before long. Shale threat Analysts suggest the strategy of maintaining output may be aimed at retaining dominance of the market in the face of increasing shale oil production in the United States. The shale boom has been one of the drivers behind the decline in the oil price. But as the oil price dips, shale becomes less economical to produce. If oil prices are allowed to remain low for some time that could cap shale production over the longer term. So keeping oil prices low may in fact make sense for Opec. ""The Saudis want Opec to remain relevant,'' said analyst Phil Flynn, speaking before the end of the meeting in Vienna. ""The only way in their mind is to subdue the US shale producer."" Opec accounts for a third of the world's oil sales.",The price of oil slumped after the Opec oil producers' cartel decided not to cut output at its meeting in Vienna.
"After her review, 27 areas were given funding to build more diverse town centres but results have been mixed. Ms Portas has now called for faster action on ""crippling"" business rates and for local councils to be given the power to take control of empty shops. The government says it has spent millions to help the High Street. ""The new powers this government has given councils and communities... have revived High Streets up and down the country,"" Communities Minister Penny Mordaunt said. A full ""structural review"" of the business rates system in England was also announced in the Autumn Statement, with the results due to be published in 2016. Portas Review main recommendations: When asked for her thoughts on delivering on the recommendations of her review, Ms Portas told BBC Breakfast that ""333 High Streets have benefited from an investment of £3.6m via their town teams"" and also pointed to additional funding made available by the High Street Innovation Fund and the High Street Renewal Awards. Markets were ""really thriving"" and the results in some of the 27 Portas Pilot Towns had been ""astonishing"", she said. But she went on: ""Three years on there is still a big job to be done. The government has made token gestures in response to my review, but much more needs to happen, and fast. High Streets in decline 16 shop closures a day in town centres 1 in 10 shops are empty 63 net increase in betting shops, the fastest growing type of shop, in the first half of 2014 1.4% reduction in October of the number of people visiting High Streets ""Why are there still so many empty shops left deteriorating on our High Streets? Local authorities should be granted the power to take control of these premises and use them creatively or commercially for the benefit of the community. ""Why are we still imposing crippling business rates which were established in Elizabethan times? The current system is out of date and favours online and big business. The Autumn Statement introduced some more rate relief measures, but these are just tinkering around the edges."" She called for the government to publish guidelines for town teams attempting to make changes, for instance on parking schemes, and for there to be a focus on town regeneration over out-of-town planning. Ms Portas also said: ""The real story behind our current fight for the High Streets is about people. ""Rotherham and Market Rasen or Deal and Sherbourne, with or without government funding, they are turning their High Streets around and getting on with it. ""Their dedication has made the place they live, work, socialise and shop a place they can cherish and be proud of. And I am proud to have been part of this worthy effort with them."" Communities Minister Ms Mordaunt said: ""Mary Portas has helped raise the profile of British High Streets and as she makes clear there are many tangible successes to be proud of. ""We've brought in a simpler planning process, with less red tape and tackled over-zealous parking to help town centres thrive. And our business rate relief for many small shops has provided £1bn worth of support.""","Retail guru Mary Portas has accused the government of making ""token gestures"" in response to her 2011 review into how to rejuvenate struggling High Streets."
"It predicted that prices would have to rise 1% between 2016 and 2020. That is on top of an increase of 5% it expects to have to make as a result of general wage inflation. The Living Wage means that the minimum wage will be set at £7.20 an hour for over-25s from April 2016, which is forecast to rise to £9.35 in 2020. The prediction came with Next's half year results - pre-tax profits came in at £347m, up 7% from the same period of 2014. Earlier in the year, the company's shares fell after it issued a cautious sales outlook, predicting they would grow between 1.5% and 5.5%. In the first half, total Next group sales were up 2.7% compared with the same period of 2014. Budget changes On Wednesday, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published some research into how far the National Living Wage (NLW) would offset the cuts in benefits and tax credits announced in the 2015 Budget. It found that families with someone in paid employment that are eligible for benefits or tax credits would lose an average of £750 a year as a result of the changes. The IFS estimates that this group of 8.4 million working-age households will gain an average of £200 a year from the NLW. It says this is an optimistic estimate because it assumes that the NLW will have no effect on GDP, employment or the number of hours worked. Those averages also mask the differences in effects on different income groups. The IFS estimated that households in lower income groups would lose more as a result of the tax credit and benefit changes but gain less as a result of the NLW.",The retailer Next has set out the effect it thinks the government's National Living Wage will have on its prices.
"By Karen MillingtonBBC Reporter But one factory in Bolton, had a last minute salvation. The operation has been revived as a social enterprise, dedicated to employing a 75% disabled workforce with all profits going back into the business or its staff. The first Remploy factories opened in the 1940s, employing people with disabilities. But with the announcement of cuts from government subsidies in March, the future is now bleak for most of its operations. ""I had to make a bit of a stealthy visit, I think I was [pretending to be] a tax inspector."" Oli Randell recalls laughing. Mr Randell, a 35 year old entrepreneur, was actually there to see if there was a way to save the business. ""The factory was still operating at the time,"" he told the BBC, and he did not want to raise the hopes of the workforce, who had been told they would lose their jobs. Mr Randell's business has expertise in HR, marketing and finance. It aims to help small companies take the next step, in order to grow at a manageable pace, by offering them part time experienced board members. Mr Randell was invited by Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce to visit Remploy's Bolton factory last summer. ""Every single person looked me in the eye; every single person reacted to me and said 'hi'. ""You don't see that all the time when you go in factories,"" he said. ""There was a lot of warmth there and there was a lot of noise and energy and spark."" As the factory, along with 35 others throughout the country, faced closure, the chief economist for the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, Dr Brian Sloan, wanted to know if Mr Randell and his colleagues could find funding to start a social enterprise. Dr Sloan thought that if the overheads could be reduced, the £1.5m turnover business - assembling components onto circuit boards - could have a future. He told the BBC: ""There was sound business behind [this] Remploy factory. ""But they were a public sector organisation trying to run as a business."" The initial period for proposals to save Remploy Bolton had closed, and staff had been made redundant. But Mr Randell and his team did ultimately put in a proposal. This was so late in the proceedings that skips were already on site. The Eleventh Hour Fortunately for the factory and its workforce, the skips were recalled and the social enterprise, known as Ability Tec, was given the green light. Former Remploy factory manager Carl Lawton, was the first to be employed, as the director of operations. Fifty year old Mr Lawton worked for Remploy for 18 years. Before joining Remploy he was frustrated in his career; he had been working as a factory inspector for thirteen years. At Remploy Mr Lawton's skills were finally developed. He gradually climbed the career ladder from shop floor operator to team leader to production manager. He spent the last five years at Remploy as factory manager. Describing the day he was told the factory would close brings Mr Lawton close to tears. He does not talk of his ""staff"" or ""employees"", but rather his people, his family. When Mr Lawton and his new colleagues took the keys to the 1,600 square feet (148 square metre) former Remploy factory, they worked out of one office, rather than heat any of the larger rooms. With some orders left from the Remploy outfit, Ability Tec started a scaled down production line in December, employing three former Remploy staff. As of today, they are still a small enterprise of seven, but have ambitions to grow. As a social enterprise, the business owns the assets; it is the employees who own the business, for as long as they are employed by it. The enterprise hopes eventually to achieve profit sharing. But first the team has a plan to become sustainable - buying new machinery and allowing the business to grow. The enterprise plans to employ 30 people within the next three years. Able to work Another element of the social enterprise is to employ people with disabilities. Once established, Mr Randell and the team would like to tap into the knowledge and experience of the former Remploy staff and become a training centre for other companies looking to employ a workforce that is disabled. The team chose the name Ability Tec to highlight staff's abilities, rather than their disabilities. Teresa Howarth is dyslexic and was concerned about finding work after being made redundant by Remploy. She told the BBC: ""When the Remploy factory closed the future looked bleak really; you hear so many stories that there are no jobs out there. ""It was quite depressing."" Mr Randell has a physical disability, but has never worked with a disabled workforce. Mr Lawton, the enterprise's operations director, is able to offer his 18 years of expertise in this area. ""With Remploy, we trained and developed our people,"" he said. ""We also knew the abilities and disabilities and how to manage that. That's the strength we've got to go forward."" In exchange Mr Lawton is learning from Mr Randell's financial experience in the commercial sector, and how to win new contracts. More than a factory Mr Randell recognises what a great manufacturing unit the former Remploy factory was, but knows business expertise was lacking, making it difficult to find new work and to keep the business moving forward. It was not only a lack of expertise and high overheads that hindered the business. Often, Mr Lawton and his fellow management team would spend a great deal of time helping members of staff with learning difficulties with important life skills, such as understanding their household bills. It was, he says, a family. But as a business, offering this type of individual support - however much it was needed, ultimately was not sustainable. But there are elements of this family atmosphere that Ability Tec are keen to revive. On Mr Randell's first visit to the factory, he stopped to read a notice board filled with thank you letters from local school children who had done work experience in the factory. ""They were really heart felt,"" he recalled. ""[They really appreciated] the opportunity to come and work in a factory and create something and see the results of their endeavours at the end of the day."" The staff have already noticed the difference of working for a social enterprise. One of Remploy's former workers, Joe Gannon who is deaf, has returned to the factory and is now employed by Ability Tec. He commented: ""The fact it's a social enterprise [means] we're working for ourselves. ""It gives you more encouragement.""","In 2012, 32 Remploy factories closed, making thousands of workers with disabilities redundant."
"The German discounter said sales rose 13.5% to £8.7bn in 2016, but operating profit dropped 17%. The chain blamed the fall on its ""continued investment in prices and infrastructure"". Aldi boss Matthew Barnes told the BBC it had invested ""a huge amount"" to keep its prices the lowest in the sector. ""We view that position of having the lowest price in the market as the contract we have with our customers, and whatever happens and whatever challenges arise we maintain that price gap,"" he added. Aldi, which currently has 726 stores in the UK, said it planned to open a further 70 this year and would invest a further £459m. The German chain currently has a 6.9% share of the market, according to the latest industry figures from Kantar Worldpanel. This figure makes it the fifth-biggest supermarket in the UK after Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. ""We have seen discounters' growth slow down over the last four years and we expect that slowdown in growth to continue,"" said Tom Wharram, analyst at Bernstein. He said Aldi had been hit by rival Tesco's introduction of a budget range of own-label ""farm"" brands last year. Aldi's ""Project Fresh"" initiative - aimed at creating more store space for fresh food and wider aisles - had also weighed on profit, he said. ""These are features we would more traditionally associate with a supermarket than a discounter and suggests they are expanding growth by moving away from a pure discounter model,"" he added. Aldi said that its future investment plans were unaffected by the UK's decision to leave the EU. It plans to continue its rapid expansion and has said it will have 1,000 stores in the UK by 2022. ""The fact that more and more customers walk through our doors every day of the week gives us the confidence to carry on investing,"" said Mr Barnes. While the majority of consumers in the UK still shop at the big four supermarket chains - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - Aldi and its low cost rival Lidl have had a huge influence on the sector. Their presence has sparked a prolonged supermarket price war and changed consumers' attitudes towards no-frills shopping, eroding snobbery towards discount retailers. Yet Aldi continues to sell a fraction of the products its bigger supermarket rivals stock. Aldi has around 1,700 products, compared with the 20,000 to 30,000 items you find in a typical big supermarket. The vast majority (94%) of these are private label. Not being beholden to the big brands enables Aldi to buy products more cheaply and pass on that saving to customers. Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent The most striking number in these Aldi results is the extra £1bn in sales it has added in the space of a year. This business is still pinching customers from rivals. Critics say Aldi's growth is predominantly space driven - in other words because it's still relatively small it's got lots of capacity to grow, something the big established players don't have. But when it opens a new supermarket, the shoppers come. They like the prices. That's one big reason why profits have taken another knock, as Aldi can't afford to be beaten by its big competitors on price. It's also pouring money into new stores and infrastructure, to keep up with the demand. No sign of a consumer slowdown here.",Aldi has reported record sales in the UK and Ireland for last year but its profits have fallen sharply amid a fierce price war among supermarkets.
"Viewpoint by Steve HiltonAnalysys Mason Steve Hilton is the lead analyst for TMT business Analysys Mason's SME Strategies and Enterprise research programmes, specialising in fixed and mobile communications services, M2M, cloud services and sales channels. In In case you haven't heard, small business employees are more mobile than ever before. Suffice it to say we all lead very hectic lives, and having access to information, applications and customers at non-traditional business hours (for example, 4am when my 18-month-old is awake) and non-traditional work venues (for example, the football field while a child has practice) is important to help us balance a busy business and home life. My job is to find ways to make a small business more effective, efficient and energised. I've found right-sized solutions to help small businesses based on the tools that already help large businesses be effective, efficient and energised. As turn-of-the-century American author Ambrose Bierce once wrote, ""There is nothing new under the sun but there are lots of old things we don't know."" This succinctly describes some of the best mobile technology finds for small businesses in 2012. Business spending on mobile data services continues to increase while spending on mobile voice services decreases. Why? Because employees want access to more and more mobile apps and we expect that trend to continue. Unified communications (UC) is a technology that links together email, messaging, voice calling, video calling, security, and some other bells-and-whistles into a single package. It continues to be a top seller for SMEs that want to simplify their technology environment and save some money, while also adding some value-added services to their IT environment. An example would include Microsoft's Office 365 solution, which is often sold to SMEs through companies like TeliaSonera, Vodafone and many others. Solution According to our research, a solution like Microsoft's Office 365 can save a SME 67% of its UC costs per year compared with a similar on-premises solution. There are other good cloud-based UC packages as well from vendors like BroadSoft, Cisco Systems, Siemens Enterprise Communications and others. All are generally available from your local fixed-line or mobile telecoms provider. UC solutions offer good mobile integrations for almost all smartphones, so SMEs should make sure they take advantage of this must-have mobile technology. Second solution Are you a little concerned about all those smartphone-toting employees of yours? How are you going to manage usage, secure any information on the devices and monitor those monthly bills? Mobile device management (MDM) solutions allow a SME to manage all those mobile devices with one unified portal. They provide security, remote back-up, patch management and various other management features. Some MDM solutions also provide simple expense management reports, so an SME can keep track of its monthly mobility spending. Vendors have targeted MDM solutions towards large enterprises for many years, but the surge in smartphone take-up - and the need to support multiple operating systems - is pushing MDM into SMEs. I particularly like the solution from AirWatch, but there are other MDM suppliers for larger SMEs, including Good Technology, MobileIron, Movero and ubitexx. Fleet-management solution Do you have a small fleet of vehicles you want to track? Want to be more precise in scheduling deliveries and keep your customers happier? No longer the sole domain of large enterprises, fleet-management solutions are coming to the SME market. Providers have offered this technology for more than ten years, and we're likely to see productised solutions appearing on the market as telecoms operators become more focused on expanding their businesses. Many telecoms providers will offer fleet management solutions for retailers, wholesale/distribution companies and various trades (such as plumbing and electrical) with fleets of 15 or more vehicles. We anticipate a slimmed-down set of fleet-management features and a user interface that is simpler than those of enterprise fleet-management solutions. In addition to telecoms providers, there are many fleet-management vendors, including Agile Access Control, Chevin Fleet Solutions, Roadnet Technologies, Telogis and Trimble Navigation. In summary, mobility is a huge challenge for SMEs, and I expect this to continue as companies play ""catch-up"" with one of the biggest trends shaping our personal and working lives.",As part of our series on how small and medium-sized firms use technology - which will run throughout March - we ask experts for their views.
"By Lorelei MihalaBusiness reporter Until last year, the 52-year-old was in the enviable position of owning an apartment in Barcelona that he had rented out since 2013 via booking platform Airbnb. With the Spanish city being one of the most popular tourist destinations in Europe, he was fully booked in 2019. Then coronavirus hit at the start of last year. Official tourist figures from Spain's National Institute of Statistics show starkly the impact. In 2019, Spain's Catalonia region had 19 million overseas visitors, with an estimated 12 million of those going to Barcelona, the capital. Yet in 2020, visitor numbers to Catalonia plunged 80% to 3.8 million. And for April and May of last year not a single overseas tourist went to the Spanish region, at least according to the government data. ""The first Covid related cancellation was in the middle of February 2020, and it was actually the biggest reservation of the year that got cancelled, for the Mobile World Congress [annual mobile phone trade show in Barcelona] a week later,"" Mr Schmidt says. ""Then it didn't go back to normal at all."" While back in 2017, Barcelona had brought in new laws to try to limit tourism numbers suddenly it had none. And Mr Schmidt had to quickly pivot his business model. So he switched from hiring out his apartment on a weekly basis to now absent holiday makers, to month-long stays for business people. The problem is that Mr Schmidt makes much less money, having to reduce rates by 55%. However, he says he is relieved to have some money coming in. ""I'm pleased! At least some income and someone is in the apartment."" In renting out his apartment, Mr Schmidt is a member of a diverse global economic grouping known as the ""sharing economy"". You share something with other people, either making money or paying in the process. So it includes everything from renting out furniture, or your car, or paying to do some work at a shared working space. Or sharing an Uber ride with a stranger. Like everything else, the shared economy has been greatly affected by the pandemic. Shared workplace providers were particularly badly hit, having to close sites, due to lockdowns and social distancing rules. One provider - US firm WeWork - made the headlines after users refused to pay their agreed rent. Yet with the end of the pandemic now finally perhaps in sight, another shared co-workspace business - Venture X - predicts the sector will grow this year thanks to people who don't want to return to their office, but struggle to work from home. ""While before people were fantasising about working from home... the single most common request over the course of 2020 was from individuals who could not work productively from home, be that down to lack of space, lack of connectivity, or simply lack of inspiration or human interaction,"" says Tom Foster, the firm's UK boss. ""What the pandemic did was throw traditional work practices into chaos. Now that the dust is beginning to settle a bit, everyone is asking, 'What do I want?'. ""I don't believe working from home will be the long-term default for most teams, but... how we shift back is uncertain. Co-working is perfectly placed to ease this transition. Co-working will be a sector in-sync with a post-Covid world."" Across in Belgium, three university friends launched a furniture rental business called Giotto at the start of last year, just before the pandemic hit. They soon tweaked their business model in response. ""The confinement happened shortly after we built our first website,"" says co-founder Juliette Jaupitre, 29. ""We originally offered furniture for the whole house, but we decided to refocus on home office furniture as we saw it was a more urgent pain to solve."" The company buys products from sustainable European designers, and rents them to subscribers. So far, an ergonomic office chair has been their most popular item. ""We truly believe that the future of work is hybrid,"" says Ms Jaupitre. While some sharing firms made more money from the pandemic, others chose to not make any at all. That was what happened at Karshare, a website and app from Bristol that allows people to rent out their cars to others in their community when they are on holiday, or simply don't need the vehicle. The firm launched when the pandemic hit the UK in March of last year, and decided to postpone the start of its paid version until September. This was so that people could offer their cars to key workers and charities free of charge through the platform. Andy Hibbert, Karshare founder, says that while the business is still offering the free service, the commercial operation is now running parallel, and ""seeing a lot of demand... as people are less comfortable taking public transport"". He adds: ""Karshare also operates a cleaning charter and provides all car owners with hygiene kits to ensure renters can drive with peace of mind."" The global sharing economy could be worth $335bn (£240bn) by 2025, up from just $15bn in 2015, according to a report from that year from accountancy group PricewaterhouseCoopers. It remains to be seen if the pandemic will see the 2025 prediction revised up or down. Grégoire Leclercq, president of France's National Auto-Entrepreneurs Federation (FEDAE), says that regulatory and legal issues remain surrounding the sharing economy. ""There are problems of protection and liability,"" he says. ""Who takes the risk for whom, putting a person on a bicycle, or in a vehicle? ""Who covers the costs of health contribution, work accident, illness? Who assumes the costs related to Covid-19 - the purchase of equipment, compliance with hygiene rules?"" New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. Markus Perkmann, professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at Imperial College Business School, says that the increased health and safety concerns brought by Covid may have deterred some people from the sharing economy, as they may have ""higher trust"" in large-scale commercial operators. ""However, in the long-term, we can expect the successful sharing economy business models to bounce back as their intrinsic benefits will not have disappeared,"" he adds. Back in Barcelona, Mr Schmidt says: ""I suspect 2021 is going to be another write off for tourism."" However, he adds that he is pleased with his strategy of switching to longer-term letting. ""This is a growing niche market.""","Frank Schmidt says the tourists just disappeared overnight, and never came back."
"By Joe MillerBBC News, Shirebrook In a bid to prove to assembled reporters that he was all too aware of Sports Direct employees' daily vexations, billionaire founder Mike Ashley demonstrated a routine search procedure at the company's Shirebrook warehouse. In his pockets? A huge wad of red £50 notes - like a caricature of a 1980s tycoon. A brash, outspoken and often controversial figure, Mr Ashley is in many ways moulded by the business culture of the decade in which he founded the sports retail empire. But the charm offensive on display at this year's annual general meeting was an attempt to rebrand himself, and Sports Direct, in an image more appropriate for an age when negative publicity can hammer a firm's bottom line, as well as its reputation. The title of the main presentation was ""Time To Change"", and as if to emphasise this point, Mr Ashley told shareholders he ""totally agrees"" with Theresa May - who has pledged to give workers a greater say in corporate governance. For most of the meeting, the entrepreneur answered questions courteously, but his underlying frustrations were betrayed in a short skirmish with a Unite representative, in which he blurted: ""It is probably your fault that we are in this mess"". Ultimately, despite a protest vote by institutional shareholders, no heads rolled. The board, including the heavily-criticised chairman Keith Hellawell, were all re-elected, promising reforms and pleading for time to right Sports Direct's wrongs. For his part, Mike Ashley sought to emphasise the sheer size of the Sports Direct operation, repeating several times that it was ""impossible to get it all right"" in a warehouse that housed seven million pairs of shoes. But he appeared genuinely repentant, not avoiding difficult questions from attendees, and vowing that conditions in the site branded a ""Victorian workhouse"" would improve. ""If the headline is 'Sorry' then so be it,"" he told the quote-hungry group of reporters. ""Because clearly I could have done a better job."" The question is: would we have been treated to the same mea culpa had the share price remained at the level it was a year ago?",It was a telling moment in a day that was supposed to be a perfectly orchestrated piece of corporate theatre.
"The conditions had already triggered payments to two million people in the last week, at a total cost of £50m, the Department for Work and Pensions said. Payments go to those on Pension Credit and many other income-related benefits. Each seven-day period of freezing temperatures results in an automatic £25 addition to help families to keep warm. The coldest areas this year have been Aviemore, Braemar and Loch Glasgarnoch in the Scottish Highlands. They have all had these seven-day trigger periods on four occasions this winter There have been a number of areas in England which have had qualifying cold spells, including Bingley, Sheffield, Norwich, Nottingham, Bedford and High Wycombe. People in several areas of Wales have had the money, among them Capel Curig, Lake Vyrnwy and Sennybridge. However, around 1.5m pensioners are missing out, the result of not claiming Pension Credit even though they are struggling on low incomes. They need to put in a Pension Credit claim in order to receive the payments. ""I want to ensure the most vulnerable people know about the support that is available,"" said Steve Webb, the pensions minister. ""With more cold weather expected in the next week people should not have to worry about turning up the heating when temperatures plummet."" Payments so far this winter are behind the total of £129m last winter, and well short of 2010-11 which saw £430m distributed in 17 million payments.",Cold weather payments are set to surge as a result of the freezing weather engulfing much of the UK.
"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter Programs such as Adblock Plus, AdFender and Popup Blocker Pro have long claimed to protect consumers from intrusive web ads that slow down our browsers and hoover up personal data. Around 200 million people globally are estimated to use such apps. But for businesses that depend on web advertising, ad blockers could cost an estimated $21.8bn (£15bn) in lost revenue a year. While some dispute this figure, most in the industry agree that ad blockers threaten publishers' ability to provide content free at the point of use. Now publishers and advertisers are fighting back; the battle of the blockers is heating up. Fighting back Free London-based business newspaper CityA.M. is one of several publishers to have tried blocking visitors to its site if they have an ad blocker switched on. The firm, which has been working with the anti-ad block start-up Rezonence, says about a quarter of its readers use ad blockers, but that there has been ""no perceivable drop in traffic"" since it launched the strategy in October 2015. ""We have had a trickle of complaints, but not many,"" digital editor Emma Haslett tells the BBC, adding that the firm had extended the strategy - which was initially aimed at Firefox users - to all internet browser types. Others, like Conde Nast's men's magazine GQ, have tried charging ad blocker-users for access, while US business magazine Forbes is asking users to turn their blockers off in exchange for an ""ad-light"" experience. If readers comply, Forbes says, they will be shown no welcome ad, no video ads inserted between paragraphs, and no ads between posts. If they don't, they will be denied access to the site's content. ""Since we started in December, four million desktop visitors, or over 40% of those asked, have either disabled their blockers or whitelisted Forbes.com, gaining access to content and the ad-light experience,"" says chief product officer Lewis Dvorkin. Whitelisting means telling an ad blocker or security program to treat a certain website as safe. 'Coding tug of war' Not everyone is convinced by this approach, however. Johnny Ryan of anti-blocking start-up PageFair believes ad blocking walls are relatively easy to bypass. ""Often publishers simply update their code, forcing the ad blocking community to get working again. It is a coding tug of war,"" he says. Instead, PageFair's technology enables publishers to display ""respectful and unobtrusive ads"" that do not get filtered out by ad blockers. In a variation on the theme, former Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich has launched a browser called Brave, which replaces the targeted ads on websites with ""clean"" ones that do not record user data or slow down browser speeds. It claims it will be able to pay publishers a higher proportion of ad revenues generated by cutting out middlemen. And it plans to roll out a system that lets web users make micropayments to publishers they like, in exchange for an ad-free experience. Privacy app Ghostery is also adopting a more nuanced approach. It shows consumers which ad-serving technologies a website has switched on, and then offers the choice to block or whitelist those services. Going native According to the Association of Online Publishers, companies also need to display ads that don't annoy consumers in the first place. This is why mobile video is proving so popular as an ad format - it's entertaining if done well and therefore more acceptable to consumers. Mobile video will account for 87% of global advertising spend by 2018, according to ZenithOptimedia. Sponsored articles and videos - so-called native advertising - could be another solution, say some, being less obtrusive than traditional pop-up and banner ads and harder for ad blockers to detect. How much of a threat this poses to independent journalism is another debate, however. While offering more appetising advertising is vital, ensuring it does not affect the functioning of a website is equally important. The problem, says Tej Rekhi of ad management company Sizmek, is that too many sites are ""over-tagged"" because of their ads and that this slows down page-loading speeds. ""Publishers need to make use of the technology that exists to unify tags in one place, allowing for faster load times and better results,"" he says. Innovations such as Facebook's Instant Articles - which lets users load articles on mobiles 10 times faster than the traditional mobile web - point to a way forward. 'House in order' But is all this concern about ad-blockers overhyped? App market analytics firm firm App Annie tells the BBC that - despite an initial surge of interest after Apple's announcement - the most popular ad blocking programs have all dropped out of the App Store's top 100 most downloaded apps and now rank much lower. And Stuart Miles, editor of tech news site Pocket-lint, says: ""The media likes to stir things up when it comes to ad blocking. But in reality, the majority of people aren't bothered because they have to install something, and they never get round to it."" That said, Andrew Frank, digital marketing expert at technology research firm Gartner, believes ad blocking is growing quickly and its effects could be severe ""for an industry that already faces challenges"". Facebook warned investors in January that ad blockers could ""adversely affect"" future profits. Ciaran O'Kane, founder of ad tech research company ExchangeWire, doubts we'll see affected companies ""die on the vine"", but says they will have to adapt. ""Media companies have certainly sacrificed some of the user experience online for the sake of extra revenue. ""So I think this is a great opportunity for the ad industry to finally get its house in order."" Follow Technology of Business editor @matthew_wall on Twitter.","When Apple said it was going to allow ad blocking on the iPhone version of its web browser last September, it escalated a conflict that had been building in the digital economy for years."
"The comments come on the day that Lord Adonis launches a public consultation into the UK's infrastructure. Speaking to the BBC, he also highlighted traffic congestion. Lord Adonis said traffic speeds in London had fallen dramatically over the past five years and in much of the city were lower than in 1914. He warned that without action the UK faced gridlock on roads, railways and in the skies, along with worsening air quality. ""We've got to get real about tackling congestion and with it, air pollution, because the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has rightly highlighted air pollution as one of the big killers and threats to the quality of life in London,"" he said. He also argued that mobile phone companies need to be pushed to raise investment in their phone networks. ""Making a mobile phone call is rather like watching an early Charlie Chaplin black and white film where the picture is fuzzy and it disappears every 10 seconds or so. ""And try making a mobile phone call on a train and it's nearly impossible across much of the network,"" he said. Ofcom which regulates the phone industry said: ""We agree that mobile coverage must improve, and we also want to see more people right across the country being able to access faster broadband. ""Our rules mean virtually all UK premises must receive a 4G signal by the end of this year."" UK infrastructure challenges - Lord Adonis Lord Adonis is launching the consultation in Birmingham along with the mayors of five metropolitan areas. West Midlands mayor Andy Street said there needed to be a ""massive"" investment in public transport in his region. Mr Street argued that investment in transport and communications could help to cure the UK's sluggish growth in productivity. ""If you improve your mobile broadband speeds, you improve the productivity of your business. If you reduce congestion you improve productivity,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.","Mobile phone coverage in the UK is ""deplorable"", according to the chairman of the national infrastructure commission, Lord Adonis."
"Kunlun Group's board said that going public would ""strengthen"" Grindr's competitiveness and help the business continue to develop. The Chinese tech firm originally bought a 61.5% stake in 2016 from the company's US founders. It then took full control in January. In a public filing on the Shenzhen stock exchange, Kunlun Group said that after the initial public offering (IPO) was completed, financing arrangements would be made to support Grindr's expansion. Grindr, which is based in Los Angeles, is a hugely popular dating network for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, with over 27 million users globally as of 2017. It is free to use, with optional subscription plans for additional premium features. Grindr was the first gay social networking app on the iTunes App Store and is currently available in 192 countries, although its user base is primarily located in developed countries in Europe and North America. The app was founded in March 2009 by Joel Simkhai, an Israeli immigrant to the US who grew up in Mamaroneck, in the state of New York. Mr Simkhai originally created Grindr as a way to help people find others with similar interests using geolocation data, but it quickly gained popularity in the gay community through word of mouth and articles in the media. In January 2016, Kunlun Group bought a 61.5% stake in Grindr for $93m (£71.4m), before purchasing the remaining shares in January this year for $152m. When Kunlun Group took full control of the company, Mr Simkhai, Grindr's chief executive left the company. Despite being owned by a Chinese firm, Grindr is not the number one gay dating app in China. That position is held by Beijing-based app Blued, which claims to have 40 million users worldwide. According to research from US investment bank Piper Jaffray, the most popular dating apps used by straight single millennials are Tinder, Bumble and OKCupid.","Gay dating app Grindr is to list its shares on international stock exchanges, under a plan submitted by its Chinese parent company Kunlun Group."
"By Adam ParsonsPresenter, Wake Up To Money Neil Woodford said GlaxoSmithKline needs radical restructuring. The founder of Woodford Investment Management said GSK should be divided into separate companies, rather than run as a single £65bn giant. In an exclusive interview with Radio 5 live's Wake up to Money he said GSK is so complicated it is ""like four FTSE 100 companies bolted together"". And, he says, the pharmaceuticals giant does not ""do a particularly good job of managing all of the constituent parts"". On Friday, Glaxo's shares were up 2.5%, outstripping the rest of the market. Mr Woodford said: ""We'd like the business to recognise that it should focus on certain activities in the portfolio and do them better than they have done in the past, demerge the bits they haven't managed particularly well and let other people who specialise in those activities run those businesses."" GlaxoSmithKline is one of the five most valuable companies listed on the stock market. Breaking it up, in the way Mr Woodford is proposing, would mean the company changing radically and is likely to involve a heated conflict between him and the company's chief executive Sir Andrew Witty. But Mr Woodford is adamant, insisting ""the sum of the parts is worth more than the current share price"". He also launched a robust defence of his long-term support for tobacco companies. Biggest mistake Mr Woodford's investment fund owns well over £1bn worth of shares in tobacco companies, but he defends himself against claims that he's endorsing an industry that other investors have shunned. ""I'm paid to exercise investment judgement. I have to look at my investment universe and pick the best investments that I can and expose my investors to those investments and hopefully deliver attractive returns. ""And I have throughout my career believed the tobacco industry offers some very attractive characteristics. Probably, if I were to put my hand up, the biggest single mistake I've made in my career is not having enough tobacco exposure."" Mr Woodford established himself as one of the UK's best-known investors while running funds for Invesco, producing notable returns and establishing them as a mainstay of many people's pensions. He set up his own firm in 2014, and now manages around £14bn of clients' funds. His reputation is towering. Mark Dampier, research director at the stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, calls him ""arguably the greatest fund manager of his generation"". Mr Woodford rarely speaks to journalists - when we meet in his office on the edge of Oxford, it is the first broadcast interview he has given for nearly a year. China bank crisis But when he does talk, his opinions hold great sway, backed by a record of successful long-term investment that has drawn comparisons between him and the American billionaire, Warren Buffett. Mr Woodford is, frankly, downbeat about the prospects for the global economy. ""I don't really believe in the consensual view that the world economy is about to leap from the post-crisis world into a new normalised world where interest rates normalise and growth normalises and we all have a better time. I just don't believe in it. He said the problems of growth, lack of productivity and the threat of deflation ""haven't changed at all"". And, he adds, the Chinese economy ""is weaker than they admit, with probably a banking crisis round the corner"". Rather than recovering in the coming weeks and months, he expects the Chinese economic issues that have blighted the start of this year to get worse. ""It's embarrassing for the authorities there, it's difficult and it's going to be hard to control,"" he said. Against this backdrop, Mr Woodford believes the US had made a mistake in raising interest rates, saying that it had been a decision made for symbolic, rather than pragmatic, reasons. His prediction is that, before the end of the year, America's Federal Reserve will have to back down, and cut its rate back to where it was. And while many people have predicted an interest rate rise in the UK in the coming months, he said the idea of an increase this year is ""ludicrous"", saying ""the economy could not withstand higher interest rates"". 'Flipped, flopped' He fears a currency crisis on the back of an ""awful"" trade balance, with the UK consistently importing far more than it sells abroad, but says ""there are plenty of economies in a worse state"". Mr Woodford also says there is no convincing economic argument for Britain to either stay, or leave, the European Union, predicting the forthcoming referendum would instead be decided by ""the emotional, visceral side of the debate"". As for the state of Europe, Mr Woodford believes that only a huge programme of debt relief will save Greece from a never-ending financial crisis. He said: ""The people who lent the money to Greece made a fundamental error, as did the people who borrowed it, but we will never allow the Greek economy to emerge from this awful situation until we address the issue of debt write-off."" Dressed in jeans and a jumper, he talks freely, with fluency and with the confidence of someone whose portfolio of investments have comfortably and consistently outperformed the stock market. Sainsbury's proposed purchase of Home Retail Group, which owns Argos and Homebase, ""does not look a particularly good deal"", the level of personal debt in the UK worries him and he agrees with the Chancellor, George Osborne, that complacency in the UK economy is dangerous and unmerited. The Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is doing a good job ""to some extent… He's flipped and flopped, but he hasn't done anything silly"". Outside his office, a Premier Inn is being built over the road. Unlike most fund managers, he eschews London and instead bases himself on an industrial park outside Oxford, with a staff of 35. There is, he says, no need to be in London when his clients worry about returns and pensions, not the glitz of a Mayfair office. His focus is notable and he's renowned for backing his judgment - something that GSK will have to deal with.","The UK's biggest drugs company should be split up, says one of Britain's most successful and influential investors."
"The lender said price growth ""almost ground to a complete halt"", with prices up by just 0.1% from a year earlier, down from a rate of 0.5% in December. The average property price was £211,966, the building society said. The Nationwide said it was likely that the recent slowdown in the market was due to ""the impact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment"". It said this uncertainty among buyers was outweighing the otherwise positive backdrop of ""solid employment growth, stronger wage growth and continued low borrowing costs"". The last time the Nationwide's annual price growth measure was weaker was in February 2013, when it registered zero growth. The Nationwide survey, which is based on its own lending data, showed that house prices rose by 0.3%, accounting for seasonal factors, in January compared with December. There was no change in prices in the three months to the end of January compared with the previous quarter. Earlier in January, a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) found their members thought the outlook for the housing market over the next three months was the worst for 20 years. A net balance of 28% of RICS members expected sales to fall, the most downbeat reading since records started in October 1998. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ""The economic outlook remains unusually uncertain. ""However, if the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with the unemployment rate and borrowing costs remaining close to current levels, we would expect UK house prices to rise at a low single-digit pace in 2019."" House price predictions for 2019 These predictions show an average for UK house prices, but each of the commentators point out that the picture can vary significantly in different parts of the country. It can also vary in different neighbourhoods of the same town. Read more: Will the value of your home change in 2019? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the slowdown was ""a sentiment-led deterioration in house price growth, which chimes with the drop in measures of consumers' confidence since November, when it became clear that the [Brexit] withdrawal agreement would not be ratified seamlessly"". He added: ""Looking ahead, increasing numbers of prospective house-buyers likely will wait a few months for Brexit uncertainty to fade, forcing sellers to lower asking prices to attract braver buyers in the interim. As a result, year-over-year declines in house prices in the near term should not be ruled out."" Where can you afford to live?

"Banks have built up strong capital buffers since the financial crisis more than a decade ago, the Bank said in its latest financial stability report. Most risks to the UK's financial stability posed by a no-deal Brexit have been mitigated, it said. But it warned that ""some disruption to financial services could arise"". Businesses, with the support of government guarantees, have borrowed £80bn so far this year, compared with £20bn by this time last year, according to the Bank. It said the major UK banks could absorb credit losses in the order of £200bn, but that would involve ""incredibly severe"" shocks that were unlikely to occur. For instance, unemployment would have to rise to 15% and house prices to fall by 30%. Former Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance told the BBC that the Bank saw the banking system as ""very resilient"". ""I think that the Bank's assessment makes sense,"" he said. However, he warned that outside the financial system, a no-deal Brexit would pose big challenges. ""The real economy is going to struggle if we go into a Brexit no-deal,"" he added. Market volatility ""Financial sector preparations for the end of the transition period with the EU are now in their final stages,"" the Bank's report said. ""Most risks to UK financial stability that could arise from disruption to the provision of cross-border financial services at the end of the transition period have been mitigated."" However, it added: ""Financial stability is not the same as market stability or the avoidance of any disruption to users of financial services. Some market volatility and disruption to financial services, particularly to EU-based clients, could arise."" The Bank said financial institutions should continue taking measures to minimise disruption. Mortgage debt On the housing market, the Bank noted that activity had picked up sharply in recent months, but the number of advertised mortgage products had continued to fall and was ""materially lower"" than earlier in the year. ""While some lenders have reintroduced products since the early stages of the pandemic, others have withdrawn further, especially at higher [loan-to-value] ratios,"" it said. The Bank said it was important to prevent a rapid build-up of mortgage debt, which it said had ""historically been an important source of risk to financial and economic stability"". To that end, the Bank's Financial Policy Committee had recommended limiting the proportion of new mortgages with high loan to income ratios, guarding against an increase in the number of highly indebted households. Those recommendations are under review and the conclusions will be published next year.","UK banks are well prepared for serious economic shocks and can continue to lend during the pandemic, the Bank of England has said."
"The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres are expected to stay open if it falls into administration, at least in the short term. Intu has already warned that longer term some of its centres may close. The company is the UK's biggest shopping centre group, with 17 centres in the UK and three in Spain. Should Intu fall into administration, the shopping centres are likely to remain open while the administrators decide what course of action they want to take. Options will include trying to sell the centres on to other potential buyers. Retail analyst Richard Hyman said he expected that most of Intu's shopping centres ""will live to fight another day"". ""Possibly not all, but most,"" he said. ""There are some very good and important centres in Intu's portfolio."" Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak, and about 132,000 jobs in the company and in its wider supply chain will be in question should the firm fall into administration. Retail expert Kate Hardcastle said one area of concern was Intu's £4.5bn debt, given the declining value of its shopping centres. They ""just aren't worth the value they once were"", she told BBC Breakfast. While the coronavirus crisis forced the closure of all non-essential shops, retailers had already been under pressure from a host of factors including changes in shopping habits as people move online. Big shopping centre landlords such as Intu rely on big retailers for their revenues - but in recent years retailers have been asking landlords for rent reductions due to the pressures they are under, Ms Hardcastle said. Coronavirus effects Mr Hyman said that retailers were already under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic, and had too much floor space. The pandemic had then speeded up a shift to online shopping. ""What would have taken five years to evolve - we're seeing that happen now,"" he said. ""People have been forced to shop online. When the dust settles, some of that spend will come back to physical stores - but not all of it will."" Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. In its update to investors on Friday, Intu said it had failed to reach agreement in discussions with lenders on so-called ""standstill"" terms, under which it would look to defer interest payments on its large and complex debts. It was also seeking agreements from its wide range of creditors, from big banks to hedge funds, for them not to take action if it breached certain terms on its loans. Intu has already lined up administrators KPMG as a ""contingency"".","The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has warned that it is likely to call in administrators."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter This is of a whole different order. The bid from US-based Pfizer could be as high as £65bn. If the merger goes ahead it would create the biggest pharmaceutical business, and one of the biggest overall firms, in the world. At the time of the Kraft deal, there was much discussion about whether there should be more protection for British businesses in the event of a foreign takeover. Unlike countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States, the UK has relatively few powers to intervene. It can ""call-in"" - ie possibly block - bids in the defence, water and media sectors. But beyond that there is no national interest defence. Those who argue against any special protection say that keeping British businesses wholly open to possible takeovers improves performance for two main reasons. First, managers are aware of the possibility of a bid and act accordingly. And second, government protection leads to more sterile management and can actually be an excuse for under-performance. It is also pointed out that British firms gain a significant advantage from their ability to launch takeovers of overseas businesses. Change the rules in the UK, the argument runs, and expect new trade barriers to be thrown up against Britain. At the time of the Kraft-Cadbury deal, the research firm Dealogic looked at the numbers. They revealed that since 2000 there had been five years in which the UK had enjoyed a positive trade balance in the value of cross-border mergers and acquisitions. In 2007, for example, the value of assets UK companies bought overseas outstripped UK assets sold to foreign interests by £113.3bn. Even at the time of the Cadbury deal the UK was running a surplus of £1.9bn. Sir Roger Carr, then the chairman of Cadbury, said he didn't want a bid defence ""wrapped in a Union flag"". For those who argue that the government needs more powers, the key point is that all sorts of promises can be made about future investment and protection of vital research, but those can fall by the wayside once the deal is done. The Takeover Panel criticised Kraft for failing to honour announcements made during the negotiations for Cadbury that the UK would be a ""net beneficiary in terms of jobs"". Further, sectors such as drugs research are essential to the UK economy and therefore the government must be able to intervene. Pfizer is not a simple black-and-white foreign takeover story. For tax reasons, Pfizer wants to place the new business's headquarters in the UK, thereby shielding its non-US profits from American corporation tax. Ian Read, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive, has suggested that means money will flow towards Britain. ""Investment tends to follow [government] incentives,"" Mr Read said on Monday morning, pointing out that AstraZeneca was already in the process of cutting jobs in the UK. He said the US business had already ""reached out"" to the UK Government, and I am told contact could even have gone as high as the Prime Minister. Under UK takeover rules Pfizer now has 28 days to put in a bid or take its approach off the table. AstraZeneca's share price immediately rose on the news, suggesting the market is bullish on a deal being done. One major investor I spoke to certainly thought it would be, at about £50 a share (as at 2.40pm, AstraZeneca's share price was £46.96). In AstraZeneca's defence, under the newish chief executive, Pascal Soriot, shareholders appear more comfortable with the strategy - focusing on new cancer treatments - and the share price has been rising. As ever, the question will be whether there is enough jam today from Pfizer, or whether it is worth waiting for more jam tomorrow from AstraZeneca as an independent business.","As a test of industrial strategy, Pfizer's possible bid for AstraZeneca has all the hallmarks of Kraft-Cadbury take two. In that instance, Kraft put in a low-ball offer and Cadbury rejected it, before settling for a £11.6bn bid in 2010."
"The dispute between workers and the firm is over job security and terms and conditions of employment. More than 97% of votes by members of the Communication Workers Union (CWU) backed a strike. Turnout was 76%. Strike dates have yet to be announced, but the union could target the annual Black Friday retail sales event in late November and the Christmas post. The CWU says an agreement reached with management last year to raise pay and reform pensions is not being honoured. About 110,000 members of the union were balloted in the dispute. Royal Mail says it has 51% by volume of the UK parcel market. Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of the CWU, accused Royal Mail of breaking the ""progressive"" agreement that it reached with the union a year ago. He added: ""Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British postal service in the interest of fast-track profit and greed."" 'Very disappointed' The CWU's general secretary, Dave Ward, urged Royal Mail to enter ""serious negotiations"" with the union. Royal Mail said it was ""very disappointed"" that the CWU had chosen to ballot for industrial action and said it was still ""in mediation"" with the CWU. ""We want to reach agreement. There are no grounds for industrial action,"" the firm said. Strikes at the privatised postal service were averted last year after Royal Mail agreed to raise pay, reform pensions and reduce weekly working hours from 39 to 35 by 2022, subject to productivity improvements. However, the CWU has claimed that the deal is ""under threat"" under recently appointed chief executive Rico Back. Royal Mail has said it is abiding by the agreement and has awarded two pay rises since last year. It also said it had cut the working week by an hour - although discussions with the CWU about further cuts had stalled.",Royal Mail is facing its first national postal strike in a decade after staff voted overwhelmingly for action.
"By Victoria FritzTransport correspondent, BBC News The service, currently run by Stagecoach and Virgin Trains, will be handed over to the Department for Transport, who will run it until a public-private partnership can be appointed in 2020. This is the third time a franchise on the East Coast Main Line has failed. The BBC's Transport correspondent, Victoria Fritz, answers your questions about what went wrong and what the future holds for the franchise. Why does the franchise keep failing? - Anonymous There's no one single factor. What does keep happening is that those who have won the franchise have consistently overestimated what they are capable of delivering. When bids are put together, private companies estimate how much money they will make on ticket sales over the eight years of the franchise. The temptation is to err on the side of optimism in order to win the bid. Equally, the government has to assess the validity of competing bids to check that they are realistic. In the case of East Coast, the three private companies that have tried to run it over the last 11 years, and the government of the day, got their numbers wrong. Will Virgin staff lose their jobs? Where will the staff to run the new service come from? - Alan Hillary, County Durham People who are directly employed by Virgin Trains East Coast will transfer over to London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), which is what the service will be renamed. No disruption is expected to services as a result of this transfer. Pay will remain the same for staff as contracts will transfer under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations. Is it true that when the government ran the route previously, it made a profit? - Anonymous It is true. Directly Operated Railways made about a billion pounds from 2009 to 2015 before the line was reprivatised. However, it's worth stating that the same amount of money was made on the same line by the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise in only three years. What happens to tickets booked and paid for relating to travel after the handover in June? - Kate Tickets for future travel along the route will still be valid. Train services will continue to run as normal and you do not need to change your journey plans. Usually a business has to pay to get out of a contract. Why hasn't that happened here? - David, Buckinghamshire In some ways it has. Even though the franchise was unable to make the money it thought it would, it paid the shortfall from its own pocket to make sure it met its obligations to the government. Stagecoach, the company that owned 90% of the Virgin Trains East Coast franchise, will have to pay an outstanding performance bond. That's thought to be around £19m. There will also be a one-off expense of around £75m because the assets are not recoverable. Why can't the East Coast Main Line be sold as an independent company? Why does it have to be run as a franchise?- Mike Steinbach, Israel The franchise model is the system by which the government has decided to run the railway. It believes that this way the risk falls on the franchise and not on taxpayers. By awarding a franchise, the government is able to control the routes and ticket prices. It also gives them some oversight of how much money it will make and when. An independent company would have no obligation to keep providing a public service if it became unprofitable. It could potentially stop services, cancel routes and rapidly raise ticket prices. Who owns the trains that currently run on the line? - Shelia Trains (carriages, locomotives and freight vehicles) in Britain are, in 99% of cases, actually not owned by franchises. They are owned by a number of rolling stock companies and leased to businesses. What does this mean for the prospective upgrade of the rolling stock to Hitachi Azuma trains later this year? - Steve Dodding Two brand new Hitachi trains arrived from Japan earlier in the year and are being used for training on-board crew and drivers. This new fleet of 65 trains is still expected to be rolled out in December. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said in the Commons that the new trains will just have different branding. Produced by George Pierpoint and Kris Bramwell","On 24 June, rail services on the East Coast Main Line will be brought back under government control."
"By Belinda ParmarAuthor of Little Miss Geek The technology industry is still struggling to shake off the image of the male, pizza-guzzling, antisocial nerd - a perception that initiatives like this month's Ada Lovelace day - which celebrates the role of women in technology - and Lady Geek's ""Little Miss Geek"" campaign, are striving to change. There is no doubt that tech is overwhelmingly male. Although women fill close to half of all jobs in the US economy, they hold less than 25% of jobs in the science and technology sector, according to a government report. In the UK, the problem is even worse: currently only 17% of jobs in the technology sector are held by women. Both numbers are declining year-on-year. But in a world where women are buying more tech products than ever before (four in 10 are now bought by women, according to Forrester Research) why on earth should anyone care? So long as shiny new gadgets keep flying off the shelves, what does it matter who's making them? Serious money It's all very well appealing to a tech chief exec's sense of social injustice - but the bottom line is that they are running a business. What do they care about gender diversity, really? We ultimately need to appeal to the thing that matters most: their wallets. It's great that women are buying more technology than ever before, but tech companies can't sit back: they should be focusing their energy on getting the most out of this flourishing market. The Harvard Business Review has calculated that marketing to women represents a bigger financial opportunity than India and China combined. We're talking serious money here. That's why every chief executive should be made aware of the following stat: tech companies with more women on their management teams have a 34% higher return on investment. The reasons are obvious. Diversity is important in any industry, but is especially relevant when it comes to technology. Tech is the way that world talks to each other. People have never emailed, liked, commented, called, messaged and tweeted more than we are doing right now. And guess what? Half of all those people are women. The days of gadgets being boys' toys are dead as the dodo. The majority of tech products must be developed to appeal to as many people as possible, of either gender. For that, there can be no room for guesswork. Men and women must both be in the room. It's not that we believe women are better or more effective than men - they just simply provide a different point of view, something that is vital when bringing a new product to market. Pink it, shrink it Examples of getting it wrong are abundant: A common 'for-the-ladies' strategy is to take last year's product, re-release it at a slightly lower-price point, slightly smaller and clad in pink plastic. This pink it and shrink it approach represents typically shallow thinking about gender and usually only appeals to younger (lower income) women. Getting design right takes a lot more thought but yields bigger dividends. Dr Gloria Moss, a gender marketing expert, confirms that when targeting women, having female input on the design team is crucial: ""In design preference tests, I've always found extremely strong statistical evidence for 'same-sex preference'. Men tend to prefer the designs that men produce, and women prefer the designs that women produce."" In other words, it's no use burying our heads in the sand and pretending that a male-dominated team will get it right for women. Most of the time they won't. It's time to change things. Any chief executive with half an ounce of sense should be putting their blood, sweat and tears into ensuring that the make-up of their company mirrors the make-up of their market. It's no use blaming old-fashioned stereotypes about women not possessing the right skillsets, or simply not wanting to work in tech. In many Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria, Estonia and Latvia - also referred to the Geek Nations' - the technology gender divide is less prevalent. It's partly historic - during the communist era, all women were encouraged to work - but also that technology is perceived as a rewarding and well-paid career for women. If these countries can get talented women creating their tech products, then so can we. The Little Miss Geek campaign is doing something about it - providing a 10-point practical manifesto to help tech companies attract and retain the next generation of women. Sooner or later tech companies will wake up to the fact that getting more women through the door is imperative for business. Those that do will reap the benefits, and the rest will be left behind, eating pizza, wondering why everyone else is making so much money. Belinda Parmar is the author of Little Miss Geek, a book assessing the ways in which more women can become part of the technology industry.

You can practically smell the testosterone.
"Simon JackBusiness editor BA's computer failure or the chaotic opening of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. Lufthansa's seemingly endless industrial disputes or the United incident that saw a passenger assaulted on camera. Inglorious moments for sure. But the performance and profitability of these companies since, suggests these mistakes did not leave a permanent mark. Is this latest Ryanair incident different? Will the combination of unhappy customers, and the increased cost of retaining pilots, harm the very business model of the airline itself? Could Michael O'Leary become a lightning rod for staff discontent (the way Willie Walsh did at BA) and have to stand down? According to shareholders I spoke to today, the answers are no, no and no. In reverse order, Michael O'Leary is not some easy come, easy go, hired-gun chief executive. Although the airline was founded by Tony Ryan it became the biggest carrier of passengers in Europe under Mr O'Leary. He owns 4% of the company and has survived worse publicity than this. Higher pilots' wages will not change the economics of Ryanair. All airlines try and bear down on cost as it is a competitive business, but the things that really affect profits are external factors like the world economy and the price of fuel. Both of those things are in the industry's favour right now. So no, this incident is not different. When this current spat passes, consumers will return to looking at which airline can get them where they are going, at the price they want to pay. By way of comparison, Volkswagen announced today it is selling more cars than it did before the diesel emissions scandal. Consumers are either forgetful or forgiving - or just don't give a fig.",Airlines often have cock-ups.
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter Point One Marketing - trading as Stop the Calls - was said to have operated in a ""bullying and aggressive way"". The company, based in Bournemouth, claimed it was an official service to stop nuisance calls. It was fined £50,000 by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), following hundreds of complaints. Some people said they had been shouted at when they asked the company not to call them again. One woman who suffered from dementia was persuaded to hand over her credit card details. ""They tried to sell a product that they claimed would stop nuisance calls, knowing full well they were responsible for so many such calls themselves,"" said the ICO's head of enforcement, Stephen Eckersley. ""That they operated in what appears to have been such a bullying, aggressive way only makes matters worse."" The official way to stop nuisance calls is through the Telephone Preference Service, which is free to use.",A firm that promised to block all nuisance calls has been fined by the Information Commissioner - for making nuisance calls itself.
"In an unconventional move, the firm has not issued new shares, with those held by its private investors being sold. The flotation marks a turning point for Spotify, which is the global market leader but is yet to make a profit. In an open letter, chief executive Daniel Ek said: ""We are still early in our journey and we have room to learn and grow."" Once an small upstart Swedish music platform, Spotify has grown rapidly in recent years, adding millions of users to its free-to-use ad-funded service and converting many of them to its more lucrative subscription service. It is now the global leader among music streaming companies, boasting 71 million paying customers, twice as many as Apple Music. So far costs and fees to recording companies for the rights to play their music, have exceeded Spotify's revenues, although that gap is narrowing. Why is Spotify listing its shares? The firm made a commitment to investors who backed it as the company was growing, that they would be given the chance to cash in their investment. So Spotify had to list its shares sooner or later. But it could also herald a new phase for the firm. Being publicly traded will put pressure on the management, and could provide the excuse they need to make changes, says Mark Mulligan at at MIDia Research. ""Once you're a tech stock - more than with a normal listed company - [investors] expect you to do stuff fast, change fast,"" he says. So what will change? ""So far they've been treading a very fine line between being the dramatic new future of the music business but simultaneously being the biggest friend of the old music industry by giving record labels a platform to build out of decline,"" says Mr Mulligan. ""To go to the next phase [Spotify] will have to stop talking out of both sides of its mouth, which it does at the moment. And stop being so friendly to the record companies."" More than half of Spotify's revenue goes directly to the record companies. But they are not likely to make any bold moves immediately, since the labels also control two thirds of the music that Spotify plays. Chris Hayes at Enders Analysis says while it may not be as a direct result of the share listing, he also expects Spotify to evolve. ""I think over time they're going to have to diversify their offering,"" he says, helping to set them apart from a sea of rival streaming services. What will Spotify look like in the future? They have already moved into podcasts and producing original music. They may well start to offer more original content, such as Taylor Swift's recent video that was only made available on the platform, says Chris Hayes. It could also be thinking about emulating Berlin-based Soundcloud, which offers a social media forum for lower-profile content creators, he adds. Mark Mulligan thinks it could offer documentaries, information about artists, special music features, news articles and even comedy. Will things be different for artists? One of the thorniest issues for Spotify in the past has been a backlash from artists, who say only the biggest stars make enough income from the streaming subscription model. ""At the moment it's all about record labels. Spotify doesn't have a place for artists,"" Mulligan says. ""The bigger bolder things post [the share listing] will be doing something very clear for artists."" He thinks in time Spotify could start offering places for artists to build their own creative spaces and profile pages - so that there are ways to bypass the record labels and go straight to Spotify to reach fans. Chris Hayes thinks it will be some time before record labels are sidelined. But he says if Spotify can attract more subscription customers, payments to artists will increase automatically through the current pay-per-listen model. So can Spotify make money? The firm's first operating profit (not including debt financing) is on the horizon for 2019 based on current trends, according to Mr Hayes. ""The strategy has always been, the free tier is not very lucrative but it is a funnel through which to persuade free users to upgrade to the subscription tier, which is lucrative."" As long as subscriptions continue to grow it should eventually become profitable. Mr Mulligan thinks as the business matures it will learn to make money from its loyal customers by offering more services. Above all there is scope to exploit the data gleaned from fans' playlists, and the company could sell its data tools back to the music industry. For example Spotify's insights into people's listening habits could inform an artist planning a route for their next tour. What about the competition? Spotify may be the current market leader, but in the long-term there are threats on the horizon in the shape of the Apple, Amazon, Google and possibly even Facebook. ""Ultimately Spotify's biggest risk is: what is it like to be the only company in a marketplace that has to turn a profit?"" says Mr Mulligan. The tech giants wield vast resources and have ready-built ecosystems from smart speakers to social networks. ""Spotify's rivals are the biggest companies in the world with bottomless pockets,"" he says, and they are using music as a way to sell their core products, not as a business proposition in itself. They could offer the record labels more money than Spotify can afford to pay. ""That would be my biggest worry if I were Daniel Ek,"" he says, referring to Spotify's co-founder. ""What if Apple decided: let's throw ten billion at this and see if we can throw Spotify out of the water?""","Shares in Spotify have started trading in the New York, valuing the music streaming service at about $26bn."
"Borrowing for the six months to September has now hit £40.3bn, up £7.4bn from the same period in 2018. In the month of September, borrowing was £9.4bn - slightly lower than expected but still up from £8.8bn last year. The figures raise questions about the chancellor's room to manoeuvre in next month's Budget. Sajid Javid has said he is ""turning the page on austerity"" and promised big spending rises in his November statement. But John Hawksworth, chief economist at PwC, said: ""Today's data showed the UK public finances heading further into the red, with the deficit more than £7bn higher in the first half of this financial year than the same period last year. ""This borrowing overshoot will not make the chancellor's choices any easier as he heads towards his first Budget on 6 November."" According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the borrowing figures for September mark the first annual rise in that month for five years. The increase comes despite the government receiving a £1.1bn dividend boost last month from part-nationalised lender Royal Bank of Scotland. The ONS said borrowing was pushed higher due to seasonal payments of £2bn for winter fuel and £2.7bn of student loan write-offs - both of which are recorded in September each year. Mr Javid plans to set out new long-term fiscal rules in next month's Budget. Currently the rules state that borrowing should remain below 2% of national income, but most expect him to relax this. ""September's better-than-expected public finance figures do not change this year's overarching themes of higher spending and borrowing. If anything, today's release will only encourage the chancellor to loosen fiscal policy at the Budget next month,"" said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics. ""We already know that the chancellor wants to review the fiscal rules in the Budget on 6 November, as there is very little chance of hitting the current ones. ""We don't know what the new fiscal rules will be, but they are likely to allow for a substantial loosening of fiscal policy at the Budget, which would support economic growth. Of course, whether this happens depends on whether there is a Brexit deal.""","Public sector borrowing has risen by a fifth during the first half of the financial year, official figures show."
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education and family correspondent It might be at the hotel check-in desk. An international hotel chain has completed a two-year project to train half a million staff with the aim of spotting potential victims of trafficking. Marriott's workforce, in almost 7,000 hotels, have completed a process of mandatory training teaching them to look out for warning signs. ""Hotels can unfortunately be unwilling venues for this unconscionable crime,"" David Rodriguez, the hotel group's chief global human resources officer, said. ""There is no easy fix but combating modern-day slavery starts with awareness,"" Mr Rodriguez said. ""And we now have a significant number of people capable of recognising suspicious behaviour and reporting it to management and, in some cases, law enforcement."" Warning signs The type of signs might include ""guests with minimal luggage and clothing"" and ""individuals who can't speak freely or seem disoriented"". There might be ""guests who insist on little or no housekeeping"". Concerns about trafficking for prostitution might be raised by multiple people being escorted to a room one at a time. Staff are taught that while none of these individually might be a sign of trafficking, when there is a ""combination of indicators"", it might be time to raise concerns with hotel managers. Hotel staff, watching their guests arrive and during their stay, have an unusually close-up view of their behaviour. ""In a hotel, our people wouldn't necessarily see a human trafficker visibly restraining a victim,"" Mr Rodriguez said. 'Privacy and anonymity' But he said workers might recognise a ""scenario that is much more nuanced and harder to detect if you don't know what to look for"". ""That's why helping associates identify the signs of sexual exploitation and forced labour is so important,"" Mr Rodriguez said. A spokeswoman for Marriott said the training had recently paid off when staff in a central London branch had noticed someone ""using the hotel lobby to meet with and groom an under-age girl"". Police were contacted and the perpetrator was subsequently jailed. The hotel chain's training project has been a collaboration with a US-based campaign, Polaris, which works against modern slavery. The name Polaris is taken from the Pole Star, used for navigation by slaves escaping northwards in the US in the 19th Century. Research by Polaris has highlighted how traffickers move through hotels and motels, either when travelling with their victims or as a base for sexual exploitation and prostitution. It says it's a ""popular misconception"" to think this happens in seedy motels only - when it's as likely to be seen in mainstream hotel chains. The US Department of Homeland Security has highlighted how hotels are particularly vulnerable to being misused by traffickers - offering both ""privacy and anonymity"". Tech to identify hotels The Polaris charity has its own list of potential signs of trafficking, such as: Another hotel company, the Wyndham group, has worked with Polaris in the US to provide temporary emergency accommodation for people who have been rescued from traffickers. There have also been attempts to make it harder for traffickers to evade detection. Last month, researchers from George Washington University published a paper showing how artificial intelligence could be used to identify hotels in the US being used for trafficking. Traffickers involved in prostitution might take photographs of their victims for online adverts. And researchers have developed software to identify the hotel rooms in which the pictures were taken, matched against a database of more than a million images from hotels. There are also legal pressures on hotels to take this seriously. California, a US state that has had a particularly high number of modern slavery cases reported, has introduced legislation this year requiring hotels to give their staff ""awareness"" training about human trafficking. The battle against trafficking has moved into the front desks and lobbies of hotels. More from Global education The editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk).","The front line for preventing human trafficking might not be at airports, international borders or in police raids."
"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter The company said: ""We're really sorry that we got it wrong. ""We've listened to our Partners and changed our policy. "" Worried Waitrose workers had warned the BBC that customers and staff were being put at risk during the coronavirus crisis through its time bank system, which demanded the hours be recouped. ""Partners who are self isolating without symptoms and unable to work from home will no longer be required to 'time bank' any of their time,"" the company has decided. ""Instead they will be on authorised paid absence from day one."" The firm had expected staff to recover time they took off for sick family members. Its 'time bank' system meant ""some people will continue to show up for work,"" putting people at risk, a concerned worker told the BBC. Self-isolating problems The problem affected workers who self-isolated because a family member displayed COVID-19 symptoms. The supermarket chain's previous policy was the following: ""If they are physically well enough themselves to work, then we will explore the option of working at home in the first instance."" It meant while they were paid in full during the time they took off, they were forced to pay that time back by working overtime for no extra pay when they returned to work. They had to cover the days they missed in full, up to two week's worth of hours. Technically unpaid Before the supermarket reversed the decision a Waitrose worker - who asked to remain anonymous because of fears for their job - told the BBC: ""It means someone on a 35-hour contract would have to work an extra 70 hours if they had two weeks in isolation. ""They would be technically unpaid as the company would say they've already paid them for it."" The worker also claimed that John Lewis staff - part of the same business - were being treated differently. ""Front line Waitrose staff are being pressured to work back hours in order to protect the business, at least that's what they're telling us. ""But some John Lewis and Head office staff are being paid 100% salary to stay at home."" Meanwhile another member of staff told the Sunday National newspaper: ""My biggest concern around this is that really vulnerable people will not self-isolate or shield, and those who need to self-isolate due to family illness will put society as a whole at risk due to these punitive measures."" Flexible about pay-back The Waitrose worker who contacted the BBC said: ""The message is that time-banking is being translated as being mandatory at store level, with paid absence only for exceptional circumstances. ""But nobody has been able to discover what these circumstances are as it doesn't appear to be up for discussion."" What are other supermarkets doing? Other supermarkets appeared to have been more generous when it comes to supporting staff during the coronavirus crisis. Marks & Spencer said: ""Any colleague who needs to self-isolate for seven to 14 days can do so on full pay. ""Colleagues who are pregnant, 70+ or with the health conditions specified by the Department of Health, are already on leave for 12 weeks on full pay."" At Asda, boss Roger Burnley said: ""We've committed to supporting our colleagues that have been identified by the government as needing to self-isolate for 12 weeks, ensuring these colleagues receive full pay for their isolation period."" The supermarket is also offering 12 weeks fully paid leave to those over the age of 70, or who are pregnant and classed as vulnerable, as well as the carers of extremely vulnerable people.",Waitrose has pledged to reverse a policy where workers self-isolating because of their family had to make up their hours owed at a later date.
"It is a steep climb from the current 17% and Andrew Mackenzie described it as an ""aspirational goal"". The Anglo-Australian mining company is holding its annual general meeting in London, almost a year on from the fatal Samarco dam collapse in Brazil. Protest groups have been calling on BHP to do more to make up for the damage. Nineteen people were killed and hundreds were left homeless last November when the Fundao dam, owned by Samarco - a joint venture between BHP and the Brazilian firm Vale - collapsed. The dam burst released billions of gallons of sludge, causing significant environmental damage. The protesters want BHP to expand its compensation scheme and to cancel its plans to build another dam in the area. Gender balance When it comes to chief executive Andrew Mackenzie's aim of have a 50-50 balance between men and women, he says there is not just a moral imperative to change, but a commercial one as well. ""We will harness the enormous potential that a more inclusive and diverse workplace can deliver,"" he says. BHP argues that the commercial case for action is compelling: more inclusive and diverse workplaces perform better and have a better safety record. However, mining has one of the lowest percentages of women in its workforce when compared to other sectors. Currently, only 17% of those at BHP Billiton are women, which is in line with the industry average for mining firms, explains Jackie Woods of Australia's Workplace Gender Equality Agency. ""In the end, though, even an aspirational target is still a terrific thing,"" she says. ""It is a public show of support and intention to improve gender equality."" Stumbling blocks BHP's Mr Mackenzie makes it clear that new initiatives will be needed to boost the numbers of women it employs. ""While we have made progress, we still aren't as inclusive or diverse as we could be,"" he says. ""Without new initiatives, it would take us 30 years just to get to 30% female representation."" In a blue-collar industry, even simple things such as shift patterns can help in breaking down barriers, says Jackie Woods. ""In many cases, women still do the caring and domestic work. ""So measures like changing shift structures from 12 hours to eight hours or introducing split shifts will make it easier for women to enter such gender-segregated industries."" The agency says companies need to take a realistic long term approach. A first stumbling block to any rapid changes might be that there are simply not enough trained women available for the jobs on offer. In many cases, it's an issue that in fact has to be addressed much earlier on, in schools and universities, says Ms Woods - by setting student intake targets so that more women can access training for industries traditionally dominated by men. BHP says it has included the the goal of inclusive and diverse teams in its charter and, says Mr Mackenzie, this will now be ""a key measure of performance"".",The chief executive of mining giant BHP Billiton says his firm aims to have 50% female employees by 2025.
"Simon JackBusiness editor@BBCSimonJackon Twitter Slowly withdrawing very expensive government support programmes without crashing the economy. The government is currently paying 80% of the wages of nearly 8.5 million employees and 80% of 2.3 million self employed worker's take home pay till the end of July at cost in the many tens of billions of pounds. As the economy emerges from lockdown that will change. From 1 July, employers will be able to bring in workers part-time and pay them for the time worked. That is a month early, has been widely called for and will be welcomed. Then the hard part starts. From August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension costs for furloughed workers. From September, those contributions plus 10% of their wages and from 1 October, employers must pay 20% until the scheme ends at the end of the month. Crucially, If employers don't contribute - neither will the government. Cash-strapped employers must decide if they can take on an increasing burden to keep workers for whom there may be little or no work. The chancellor said the government couldn't go on meeting the full cost of the scheme. The hospitality industry has been particularly hard hit by the lockdown, and it will face further difficulties because of the need to maintain social distancing and potential future customer reticence to return when pubs and restaurants reopen. No special treatment The chancellor resisted calls for special treatment of this or other hard-hit sectors. David Moore is a restaurateur who owns the Michelin-starred Pied a Terre, in London. He's worried the additional costs announced by the chancellor could mean jobs would be lost. ""It would be a real shame if the retention scheme turned out to be a very, very glorified waiting room for the unemployed. And I feel that if we come back with any level of uncertainty - a lot of businesses will cut harder and further than maybe they thought of doing first"" There was also an important announcement for self employed - who got a cash grant for March - June capped at £7,500. They will now get a maximum and final payment of £6,570 in August. The withdrawal is more gradual than many had feared and the government hopes that the support withdrawal will be mirrored by business demand recovering. But we may be about to find out how many real jobs are left in the post-coronavirus economy.",The Chancellor is attempting a delicate balancing act.
"By Dharshini DavidEconomics correspondent The British buy more clothes than their neighbours and five times as many items as they did in the 1980s. What was once a monthly payday treat, is now something for every weekend - or perhaps more often than that. And who can blame us? A quick trawl around the high street reveals dresses aplenty for under a tenner, and you can get a bikini for as little as £1. Globalisation means things can be produced in far-off lands at low cost, meaning more choice and lower prices. But how is that even possible? And what of the environmental cost of our shopping habits? The relationship between shopper and fashion industry may have become dysfunctional. A BBC Radio 4 investigation for the Today programme took us from Spain to Ethiopia as we examined whether the planet, and some of its poorest inhabitants, are footing the bill for our unquenchable thirst for fashion - and how we should tackle that. How do they do it? The pressure on brands to get trends from catwalks to our backs cheaply, and deliver profits for investors, can lead to an unseemly bunfight to secure the cheapest source - a phenomenon critics refer to as ""chasing the needle"" around the world. The plight of some of those who make our clothes came into shocking relief in 2014, when 1,138 garment workers lost their lives in the collapse of the Rana Plaza factory complex in Bangladesh. The scrutiny and pressure to improve terms and conditions there was immense, and yielded results. Some big retailers - such as H&M and Converse - have started publishing lists of their suppliers, and sometimes, subcontractors - which can run into their thousands - in response to calls for greater transparency. Is the age of the sweatshop in the past? But there have been unforeseen consequences of recent trends. As wages rose in Bangladesh, companies looked elsewhere to keep costs down. In Ethiopia, for example, wages average just a third of the rates paid in Bangladesh. Rates of less than $7 (£5.75) per week are typical. Speaking on condition of anonymity, workers at a factory near Addis Ababa told us this was insufficient to live on. They also said that conditions - from unsanitary toilets to verbal abuse - were intolerable. This situation was brought to international attention by the Workers Rights Consortium campaigning group. Penelope Kyritsis, who wrote the report, told me of workers who had overtime payments withheld, and women who had their abdomens felt by hiring managers to check if they were pregnant. She claimed that there had been little improvement since the report came out some months ago. In order to head off stiff competition, the Ethiopian government has made almost a virtue out of its low labour costs. But Ms Kyritsis says that the country's garment industry can't use the excuse that at least it is providing a livelihood where none else might be available. She highlighted the ""extremely high turnover, with workers leaving garment jobs for other jobs to resume positions in other informal sectors or in agriculture"". Orsola de Castro, co-founded campaigning group Fashion Revolution in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster. Her organisation is encouraging customers to ask tougher questions of their favourite brands, via a postcard campaign. ""There are two great misconceptions when it comes to sustainability and ethics - one is that the culprit is fast fashion, and this lets the luxury sector off scot-free, when in fact it is the entire Ethiopian fashion industry that needs to be called into question,"" she told the BBC. ""And the other is that locally-made is ethical and sustainable. It isn't."" What about the environmental costs? Textile production, it's claimed, contributes more to climate change than aviation and shipping combined. And there's consequences at every stage of a clothing item's life cycle - sourcing, production, transport, retail, use and disposal. To start with the basic fabrics used, it's not as simple as cotton versus synthetic. Cotton is an extraordinarily thirsty crop. As the UK House of Commons' Environmental Audit Committee highlighted in a recent report, a single shirt and a pair of jeans can take up to 20,000 litres of water to produce. It concluded that ""we are unwittingly wearing the fresh water supply of central Asia"". Yet, a polyester shirt made out of virgin plastics has a far larger carbon footprint. Transporting items increases that further and dying fabrics can introduce more pollutants. Microplastic fibres shedding into waterways is becoming an increasing problem - a single washing machine load can release hundreds of thousands of fibres. Plus, a million tonnes of clothes are disposed of every year in the UK, and 20% of that ends up as landfill. That impulse purchase or two quickly mounts up. But whose responsibility is it to tackle this? What is the government doing? The House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee has made 18 recommendations - from taxing a penny on the price of an item to fund recycling centres, to reducing the rate of VAT on clothing repair services, to introducing more sewing lessons in schools. As yet, none of these measures have been adopted. Critics say if we're serious about sustainable fashion, the objective of policy should be to persuade us to buy less. That might need more drastic action, with perhaps an environmental tax on clothing. But given the fragile state of the High Street, and the importance of consumer spending to the economy, it's hard to see any politician entertaining that. At present, the government favours a voluntary approach, encouraging retailers to sign up to the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan - but the number signing up accounts for less than half of the UK market. How much is business actually doing? As pressure from consumers grow, retailers are taking things into their own hands. Just outside the Spanish coastal city of A Coruna lies the global headquarters of Inditex. It's hardly a household name - but its main fashion brand, Zara, is. What started as a small manufacturing outfit is now one of the biggest retailers on the planet. Moreover, Zara changed the way we shop - by bringing looks from the catwalk to the high street in just three weeks at affordable prices. The chain recently pledged to switch to 100% sustainable fabrics by 2025. It is, of course, not just Inditex - from H&M to M&S, retailers are looking to improve how they source and their processes. Greenwash? Well, some big retailers do at least seem to be engaging and taking action. But at the heart of their business model is newness, convincing us to keep on buying - that is, if we needed convincing. Is it retailers' responsibility to convince us to buy less? Zara's Pablo Isla argues not - that the retailer is simply responding to consumer's wishes, and that those customers should have the freedom of choice. What about customers? With Extinction Rebellion climate change protests taking place outside their windows, emerging designers at London College of Fashion told us that they were going on fashion strikes - taking a vow not to spend for several months or even a year. Such action is growing in popularity, and there's an increasing focus on buying better clothing - and making do and mending torn garments. One of the designers we met even focused on making clothes out of the multitude of tents discarded at music festivals. But it may not be enough. As the popularity of social media influencers has soared, so too have concerns about the impact they may have on our attitude towards shopping. One in six influencers admit to not wearing an outfit again once it's been on social media. Eco-activist Livia Firth has been using red carpet appearances alongside her husband Colin to showcase sustainable fabrics, including fish skin ""leather"" handbags. She even persuaded him to wear a tuxedo made out of recycled bottles. She says influencers need to change their approach, saying ""if Kim Kardashian were to promote sustainable fashion, I could retire"". She likens our relationship with fashion to an addiction. With clothing demand forecast to rise by the equivalent of 500 billion t-shirts over the next decade, she may have a point. But no one as yet has found the cure.",The French or Italians might like to think of themselves as the most fashionable people in Europe - but it is the Brits that are the most dedicated shoppers.
"His internet retailer Amazon has become a global phenomenon and made him one of the richest individuals on the planet. But he took a huge risk in the 1990s when he abandoned a well-paid job in the financial services industry to start his own company. Mr Bezos, 49, was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen in Albuquerque, New Mexico in 1964. His present surname was adopted when he was four years old after his mother remarried. He grew up in Houston, Texas and Miami, Florida. Mr Bezos studied computer science and electrical engineering at Princeton University. After graduating, he had a successful career on Wall Street, where he worked in computers for banking and investment firms. 'Pioneering' focus Amazon was founded in 1994, after Mr Bezos moved from New York to Seattle. The internet was beginning to take off and internet retailers were favoured by a US court decision that they did not have to pay sales tax in states where they had no physical presence. Initially, the site was based in Mr Bezos's garage. From the start, he stressed that his aim was to focus on customers rather than competitors, which he said allowed Amazon to be ""more pioneering"".

"By James CowlingBusiness reporter, BBC News With current oil reserves coping with increased pressure from emerging markets in China and India, the Arctic and its seas are seen as being of crucial importance. US oil giant Exxon Mobil, which this week signed a multi-billion dollar deal with Rosneft to explore the Russian Arctic, described the area as ""among the most promising and least explored regions for oil"". Experts have known the region is rich in oil and gas reserves, but it didn't realise how much potential until 2009. In new findings that year, the US Geological Survey estimated the Arctic may be home to 30% of the planet's undiscovered natural gas reserves and 13% of its undiscovered oil. Huge reserves It showed that up to 160 billion barrels of oil could lay undiscovered beneath the Arctic - compared to 90 billion barrels previously estimated in the region. Researchers say that deep ocean basins have relatively low petroleum potential, but crucially the Arctic is one of the world's largest remaining areas where oil and gas are accessible. Most of the reserves are projected to be in less than 500 metres of water - roughly a third of a mile deep. The US government estimates that the world uses around 30 billion barrels of oil in a year. The figures speak for themselves, explaining why the world's biggest oil firms are clamouring for a piece of the Arctic action. But the environmental impact of any widespread drilling in the region is a key worry for green campaigners. Access to the region in the event of any oil spill would be severely compromised, especially in the winter months where only 20% of the region can be accessed by boat. Cairn Energy, based in Edinburgh, is spending $1bn drilling for oil in the Arctic this year, but faced 12 hours of disruption after Greenpeace attached itself to its oil drilling rig in June. Clean-up 'impossible' The group has been lobbying for all oil drilling and exploration in the Arctic to stop. ""All the information we have is that an Arctic oil spill would be impossible to clean up,"" said Greenpeace spokesman Ben Stewart. ""Rising temperatures mean the ice caps are becoming more accessible for oil firms; there is a bitter irony that the ice melting is being seen as a business opportunity rather than a grave warning."" Other issues include the lack of a deepwater port to remove large quantities of any oil extracted - the nearest facility is nearly 1,000 miles away. Drilling for oil in some areas of the Arctic could cause toxins such as arsenic, mercury and lead to be released into ocean waters, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. It wants uniform rules for all countries seeking oil or permitting a third party searching for oil within their own territorial waters. The World Wildlife Fund also has grave concerns about any pollution - and how it can be cleaned up. According to its Oil Spill Response Challenges in Arctic Waters report , Arctic conditions can impact on both the probability that a spill will occur from oil and gas operations and the consequences of such a spill. The same conditions that contribute to oil spill risks (including lack of natural light, extreme cold, moving ice floes, high wind and low visibility) can also make spill response operations extremely difficult or totally ineffective. However, these issues have not deterred major companies from getting in on the action. This week, US oil major Exxon Mobil signed an Arctic oil exploration deal with Russian state-owned oil firm Rosneft in the presence of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. It was a deal that BP had wanted too, and thought it had managed to agree, until it was scuppered by a legal challenge from disgruntled Russian shareholders. Nick Gellatly, an oil analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said: ""This is a new thing for Russia, as its current oil extraction is mainly done onshore, so it opens up a whole new frontier for them. ""There are challenges and restrictions to exploration - the climate will mean drilling will be restricted to certain parts of the year. ""[The deal] means Rosneft can share the cost of the exploration work as it has a large on-shore portfolio in Russia. ""In terms of other firms drilling in Russia, why not? The potential is there."" Earlier this month, a long-delayed plan by Shell to start drilling in US-controlled waters in the Arctic was finally given the go-ahead. Shell's plan will see the company drill up to four shallow water exploratory wells off Alaska's northern coast beginning in July next year. But it is not totally straightforward - the company still needs permits from the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The oil giant is well aware of the potential in the region - Shell has submitted a plan to drill up to six wells in the Chukchi Sea in 2012 and 2013.","With a seemingly insatiable demand for oil and gas, the world constantly needs to find new supplies."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Average funeral costs have risen slightly in the UK, but this masks a widening gap in different parts of the country, a survey suggests. The typical cost varies by more than £2,000, according to the Cost of Dying report by insurer SunLife. It comes amid the largest rise in excess deaths in more than 70 years. Restrictions In 2020, nearly 697,000 deaths were registered, compared with an average of nearly 606,000 each year between 2015 and 2019. This is the largest increase, or ""excess"", in a single year since 1940, according to provisional figures from the Office for National Statistics. ""Many families have suffered the unexpected loss of loved ones and have been left struggling to cover the cost of the funeral no doubt made even harder because many households are already struggling with lower incomes as a result of the pandemic and restrictions,"" said Justin Cole, director at SunLife. The company's report suggested the cost of a funeral in the South East of England had risen by 9.8% in the past year, to £5,007, while in Northern Ireland the cost dropped 7.4% to £3,222. In London, the cost was the highest at £5,235. Other regions which recorded rising costs were in North West England, up 5.2% to £3,785, Scotland, which saw a 5.7% rise to £4,064, and the Midlands, up 3.9% to £4,488. Unusual funeral requests The report also highlighted some of the more unusual requests at funerals: Costs have risen in these areas, in part, owing to the rising cost of burials - the most expensive type of funeral. However, the survey has found that the average cost across the UK increased at its slowest rate since costs were first tracked by SunLife in 2004. Costs had fallen in North East England, South West England, and Yorkshire and the Humber. The report suggested that many people had opted for cheaper, simpler funerals while they were not permitted to hold the send-off they had wanted. In 86% of cases, families said they had cut back on things they had wanted, including catering, limousines and venue hire, owing to coronavirus. Last month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) told funeral directors and crematoria to make prices clearer and warned it may re-examine the issue of pricing after Covid. However, after a two-year investigation into the market, it ruled out recommending price controls.",Families are struggling to pay for funerals of loved ones killed by Covid as their own finances are stretched by the economic effects of the pandemic.
"The average pay of a FTSE 100 chief executive is £1,020 an hour, research from the High Pay Centre and HR industry body the CIPD has found. By ""Fat Cat Friday"" bosses will have earned more than the typical annual UK salary of £29,574, the report said. However critics have questioned their calculations. According to the report, the median pay including bonuses for a FTSE 100 chief executive was £3.926m in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available. It assumed that bosses work 12 hours a day for 320 days a year, making their hourly pay rate £1,020. ""Excessive executive pay represents a massive corporate governance failure and is a barrier to a fairer economy,"" said Luke Hildyard, Director of the High Pay Centre. ""Corporate boards are too willing to spend millions on top executives without any real justification, while the wider workforce is treated as a cost to be minimised,"" he said. The £29,574 figure for median pay of full-time UK workers was taken from Office for National Statistics data. 'Cod statistics' To match that salary, FTSE 100 bosses would have to work for 31 hours, or until 13:00 on Friday 4 January. However, free-market think tank the Adam Smith Institute described the research as ""cod statistics"". ""If these activist organisations actually cared about workers, and not just the politics of envy against our best and brightest, they would talk about ways to actually increase worker pay,"" said Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Institute. ""Limits on executive pay would drive top British talent and companies offshore, ultimately leading to fewer jobs and lower pay for workers,"" he said. The CIPD report said typical pay for a FTSE 100 chief executive had risen 11% from last year. That means bosses had to work two hours less this year to match the average worker's annual salary, compared with 2018. ""Executive pay committees have to change. They should be required to include workforce representatives who can speak up for a fair balance of pay with ordinary workers. Too much wealth is being hoarded at the top,"" said TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady. Shareholders rebel Last year, the chief executive of Persimmon, Jeff Fairburn, was forced out after a row over his £75m pay award. The bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house-buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance. In October he walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. In July, Royal Mail shareholders rebelled against the company's pay plans for top executives following a row over a salary rise for its new boss. The directors' remuneration report was rejected by about 70% of shareholders in a vote, which is non-binding. New chief executive Rico Back is set to be paid £640,000 - £100,000 more than his predecessor Moya Greene. The CIPD and High Pay Centre want long-term incentive plans, which reward top executives with shares, replaced with a less complicated system based on their basic salary. They also want executives to be given incentives to improve the training and well-being of their workforce.","In the first three days of 2019 top bosses will have earned more than the typical worker will earn all year, according to a report."
"Business leaders, including from BP, BMW, Nestle, and Vodafone, told Theresa May that ""time is running out"". In a statement after the Downing Street meeting, they said that a trade deal with the EU must be ""frictionless as with a customs union"". Downing Street said that the meeting had been ""open and productive"". The industry leaders warned that ""uncertainty causes less investment."" The group, known as the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), includes BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and his Nestle counterpart Paul Bulcke. Others at the meeting were the chief executives of Vodafone, Vittorio Colao, and Royal Mail, Moya Greene. Senior figures from firms including BMW, Phillips, E.On and Ferrovial also attended the meeting with Mrs May and Brexit secretary David Davis.

She restated a commitment to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and allowing the UK to pursue an independent trade policy.

"By Ben WeiszBBC News The 33-year-old was ""devastated"" by the decision, but her employer's business had completely dried up. Louise is not alone, with the number of apprenticeships ending in redundancy in lockdown two thirds higher than in 2019, provisional figures show. The BBC obtained the data under the Freedom of Information Act. Between March and July, 1,033 people in England were withdrawn from apprenticeship programmes because they had been made redundant. This compares to 615 for the same period in 2019, according to Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) data. There are roughly 740,000 apprentices training in England in total. The apparent rise in redundancies is more evidence of the challenge facing the apprenticeship system due to the coronavirus outbreak. The ESFA said the total number of apprentices made redundant would be higher than the figures they disclosed. The numbers don't include those who go on to complete their apprenticeship with a new employer, or at a college. Some cases may also not be registered as redundancies, the agency said. More substantial data is expected later in November. 'Devastated' Louise said she had wanted to be a butcher since she was ""tiny"". ""I have never been the sort of person to want to sit behind a computer screen all day. I always like doing things with my hands, I am very crafty. I felt worth something."" But her employer provided meat to bars and restaurants - when they closed, business dried up. ""We went from having something in the region of about a thousand orders a day to having 30 and there just wasn't enough work to keep all of the staff on."" Louise was told she was being made redundant, and says she was ""devastated."" The government was already supporting trainees for 12 weeks to find new work and continue their apprenticeship, but Louise didn't have much luck. ""I contacted something in the region of 30 butchers across Coventry and Warwickshire. There were three who seemed quite keen and then once they realised I was over the age of 21 they cooled off."" ""I didn't receive much support from the training company at all. I have not even received confirmation that my apprenticeship has come to an end. I just know that it has due to the length of time it has been."" In August, Louise's redundancy went through, and she's since found work on a council-run farm, supporting adults with learning disabilities. ""It was a huge relief. I cried, I'm not going to lie. It has been a very financially difficult year for myself and my husband. I cried. And we celebrated as well!"" In October, 12% of apprentices in Great Britain surveyed by the Sutton Trust had been made redundant, up from 8% in April. A further 8% were on furlough, and 35% had been furloughed but were now back at work. 15% had remained at work but seen their off-the-job learning programmes suspended. For the UK workforce as a whole, July to September saw a record increase and a record number of redundancies, to 314,000, according to official statistics. What is government doing to help apprentices? Gillian Keegan, apprenticeships minister, told the BBC that redundancy ""is always a risk when you have got this sort of disruption in your economy so we were very focused very early on to do as much as we could to support and protect apprentices."" That support includes allowing apprentices to be furloughed, and continue their training while not working, moving to online study if need be. From August to January, employers will get a £2,000 grant for each apprentice under 25 they hire, and £1,500 for older apprentices. In September, the government introduced a redundancy support service for apprentices. At the same time, trainees who were three quarters of the way through a longer apprenticeship were granted funding to finish - previously, this had been limited to those in their final six months of training. Fewer opportunities? The pandemic has also hit the number of people starting new apprenticeships. Figures from the Department for Education show that between 23 March and 31 July in England, 58,160 apprentices started their training - down from 107,750 during the same period in 2019. Apprenticeships for the under-19s were particularly affected, down over two-thirds compared to the same period last year. The retail and leisure sectors, hardest hit by the lockdown, show a 72% fall. However, the Department said some of the apparent drop may be exaggerated by employers failing to file paperwork because of the pandemic. The first five months of lockdown also saw a steep fall in the number of opportunities advertised on the government's Find an Apprenticeship website. Tracey Matthews, an assistant principal at Milton Keynes College, said the picture was concerning. ""I don't just worry about all those apprentices we have on programme now, I also worry about those young people who wanted to get apprenticeships. We don't have as many vacancies in the system as we have had previously. Ms Matthews said she worried the uncertainty could damage the ""apprenticeship brand"". ""For the last few years in school we have been trying to encourage young people to consider apprenticeships as a viable alternative, and now actually, for those who have, maybe they're feeling their fingers have been burned,"" she said. In a special edition of the Your Work Your Money podcast, Sean and Reggie are joined by YouTuber and former BAME Apprentice of the Year Kimmy Kimani to answer your questions on apprenticeships.

"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter They do not want Dave Lewis, the new chief executive, or Sir Richard Broadbent, the under-pressure chairman, to confine their investigation to the £250m profits overstatement - serious as that is. They want root and branch change, and for some at least that change would culminate in the departure of Sir Richard himself. I first revealed investor disquiet two days ago - “Tesco investors put Sir Richard in the frame”. Investors say that Tesco has had multiple warnings. One has just told me about an analyst report dated June 2010 from the American banking giant, Citi. It said that ""Tesco's accounting is consistently aggressive"", and that if it had more ""standard"" accounting methods its profit before tax would fall by £64m. To be clear, the Citi note said that it was not implying that ""Tesco's accounting policies are in any way incorrect"". It is just that they are applied in a way that is often in Tesco's favour. Even within the business, Tesco sources have admitted that its slogan ""Every Little Helps"" often appeared to mean ""Every Little Helps Tesco"". ""Look at this company on more comparable accounting assumptions and it does not look good value,"" the Citi analysis from four years ago said. ""Tesco has a more aggressive policy than its peers with regard to revenue recognition, depreciation, property-profit allocation. ""We suggest that the cumulative impact of the increasingly strident policies they have adopted render the P&L [profit and loss] bottom line significantly different from what a peer company might report."" Sound familiar? 'Still profitable' In the 2010 note, Citi cuts its target share price to 350 pence. Tesco, of course, would kill for that number now. Shares are presently trading at 193p and are drifting down again after a short pause on Wednesday. The question could quite reasonably be asked: ""Why didn't investors make more noise about this before?"" The more cynical might suggest that they were too busy reaping the returns from a business that was hugely profitable and offered a generous dividend. Tesco is still profitable. It is still the market leader in the UK by some margin (its closest competitor, Asda, has a share of the market well below 20%, compared to Tesco's 28%). Investors I have spoken to say that they have made it clear for a long period that the internal culture at Tesco had to change. Some say that Sir Richard was too slow to act. They want him to use the present mess to reset the business. He might, indeed, consider the words of the former White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. ""You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.""","Talking to Tesco's most significant investors, it is becoming clear that the people who own Britain's biggest retailer will not be happy until the company fundamentally reassesses the way it operates."
"Net profits for 2015 are set to be around $500m (£319m), which is about $190m below analysts' forecasts. The company also said net profit for 2014 will be at the lower end of its predicted range of $580-600m. It blamed falling oil prices, changes to project timings and problems with a project in the Shetland Islands. Those issues included a protracted union dispute, as well as bad weather that had resulted in 300 days of interruption to the project. At close Petrofac shares were down 26.45%, or 315.50p, at 877.50p. Oil prices have been falling since the summer due to plentiful supply, partly from US shale, and weaker demand in Europe and Asia. Brent crude has fallen 34% since June to a four-year low of $76.76 a barrel on 14 November before recovering slightly. 'Grim picture' Ayman Asfari, chief executive, said it had been a difficult period for both Petrofac and the industry. ""In the main our project portfolio is in good shape, but it is clear that on a small number of projects our execution has fallen short of the high standards we set for ourselves."" He added: ""The medium-term growth prospects for our business remain strong."" Daniel Sugarman, market strategist at ETX Capital, said: ""The firm has painted a grim picture for 2015, warning of an expected profits decline of around 25%. ""Falling oil prices, due in part to both a huge boost in US oil production and a decline in Chinese demand, show relatively little sign of improving drastically in the near future - something bound to affect Petrofac's bottom line."" The company said in August that net profit for the six months to June 30 fell $107m to $136m, with revenues down $300m to $2.5bn. Petrofac said that net profit for 2014 was significantly weighted towards the second half of the year. Petrofac has more than 18,000 employees and seven operational centres including Aberdeen, Mumbai and Kuala Lumpur.",Shares in Petrofac have fallen by more than a quarter after the oil and gas services group warned that its profits are set to be lower than expected.
"China's state-owned investment group Citic, and US private equity firm Carlyle Group, will take control of the operations in a deal valued at $2.1bn (£1.7bn). McDonald's owns and operates about 65% of its 2,000 China outlets. Franchising allows it to take a slice of sales while cutting operating costs. McDonald's is trying to streamline its global operations, and changing its ownership structure to revolve more around franchises is a major part of that revamp. In March last year, the firm said it was seeking partners to help it add more than 1,500 restaurants in China, Hong Kong and Korea over the next five years. Under the agreement signed Monday, the US fast food giant will keep a 20% stake in its China business. Citic will hold a 52% share in the partnership while Caryle takes 28% of the new business.

"The inquiry by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) follows thousands of complaints about the ""non-crash fires"". Incidents involving fires are linked to one death and more than 100 injuries. It raises fresh safety concerns with the South Korean automakers, which have already been subject to US scrutiny. The NHTSA said fire issues and engine problems have affected around six million Hyundai and Kia vehicles since 2015. So far, only about 2.4 million have been recalled for repair. The latest investigation relates to Hyundai Sonatas and Hyundai Santa Fes, as well as Kia Optimas, Kia Sorentos and Kia Souls. The US safety regulator said that while previous recalls of Kia and Hyundai vehicles primarily related to engine fires, the fresh investigation ""is not limited to engine components and may cover additional vehicle systems or components."" Both automakers said they were co-operating with the investigation. It was launched by the NHTSA after a petition from consumer advocacy group the Centre for Auto Safety. Jason Levine, executive director of the group, said in a statement it was ""long past time"" for answers on ""why so many thousands of Kia and Hyundai vehicles have been involved in non-crash fires."" ""Hopefully, this step will quickly lead to a recall being issued as soon as possible. ""The reality is that extended investigations do not protect Kia and Hyundai owners - that requires recalls which result in effective repairs."" South Korean prosecutors are conducting separate investigations into the carmakers over the recalls.","US safety authorities will investigate nearly three million Hyundai and Kia vehicles over fires, in a move which could prompt mass recalls."
"By Tim HarfordPresenter, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy They had been riding a wagon down a nearby hill when they heard a blood-curdling scream from behind them. What appeared to be the devil himself - with the head of a man and the body of some unknown creature - was flying down the hill towards them, skimming low over the ground. They whipped their horses and fled, while the devil plunged off the road and into a flooded ditch. Imagine their fear when the devil himself then came over to introduce himself: the dark-haired Frenchman was bleeding and soaking wet. His name was Pierre Lallement. The young mechanic had been in the United States for a few months, and had brought with him from France a machine of his own devising - a pedal-cranked, two wheeled construction he called a ""velocipede"". We would call it a bicycle. Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Monsieur Lallement was soon to patent his invention, which still lacked the gears and chain drive of a modern bicycle. It also lacked brakes - which was why he had plunged down the hill towards the waggoneers with such hellish speed. His rather cumbersome model was soon superseded by the Penny Farthing, which was not the genteel vehicle we imagine through the sepia tint of nostalgia. Courtesy of the enormous front wheel, it was a racing machine - twice as fast as a velocipede. It was ridden almost exclusively by fearless young men, perched on top of a five-foot wheel and prone to pitching forward at the slightest obstacle. But the next technological step, the ""safety bicycle"", had much broader appeal. It looked much like modern bicycles do, with a chain drive, equally-sized wheels, and a diamond frame. Speed came not from a gargantuan wheel, but from gears. Safety bicycles could even be ridden in a dress. Not that that worried Angeline Allen, who caused a sensation in 1893 by cycling around Newark, on the outskirts of New York City, without one. ""She wore trousers!"" bellowed the headline of a popular titillating men's magazine, adding that she was young, pretty, and divorced. The bicycle was a liberating force for women. They needed to shed their whalebone girdles and hoop-reinforced skirts in favour of something simpler and more comfortable. They would ride without chaperones, too. The forces of conservatism were alarmed, fretting that ""immodest bicycling"" would lead to masturbation, even prostitution. But these protests soon seemed laughable. As cycling historian Margaret Guroff points out, nobody seemed concerned about what Ms Allen was doing - only what she was wearing while she did it. A woman seen alone in public on a safety bicycle seemed no scandal at all. Three years later, the elderly Susan B Anthony, a women's rights activist for most of the 19th Century, declared that bicycling had ""done more to emancipate woman than any one thing in the world"". The bicycle continues to empower young women today. In 2006, the state government of Bihar, India, began to heavily subsidise the purchase of bicycles for teenage girls transferring to secondary school - the idea being that the bikes would allow girls to travel several miles to their lessons. The programme seems to have worked, dramatically increasing the chances that girls will stick with secondary school. Even in America, the bicycle is an inexpensive way to expand horizons: the basketball superstar LeBron James has founded a school in his hometown in Ohio that supplies a bike to every student. He says that when he and his friends were on their bikes, they were free. ""We felt like we were on top of the world."" Yes, the bicycle has long been a liberating technology for the economically downtrodden. In its early days, it was much cheaper than a horse, yet offered the same range and freedom. The bicycle ushered in a manufacturing revolution as well as a social one. In the first half of the 19th Century, precision-engineered interchangeable parts were being used to make military-grade firearms for the US Army, at considerable expense. Interchangeability proved too costly, at first, for civilian factories to emulate fully. It was the bicycle that served as the bridge between high-end military manufacture, and widespread mass production of complex products. More things that made the modern economy: Bicycle manufacturers developed simple, easily repeatable techniques - such as stamping cold sheet metal into new shapes - to keep costs low without sacrificing quality. They also developed ball bearings, pneumatic tyres, differential gears and brakes. Both the manufacturing techniques and these innovative components were embraced in due course by auto manufacturers such as Henry Ford. The first safety bicycle was made in 1885 at the Rover factory in Coventry, England. It is no coincidence that Rover went on to become a major player in the car industry; the progression from making bikes to making cars was obvious. The bicycle provided stepping stones for modernising Japanese industry, too. The first step was the importing of Western bikes to Tokyo in around 1890. Then it became useful to establish bicycle repair shops. The next step was to begin making spares locally - not too much trouble for a skilled mechanic. Only 10 years later, all the ingredients existed to make the bicycles in Tokyo itself. By the outbreak of World War Two, Japan was making more than a million bikes a year, masterminded by a new class of businessman. It is tempting to view the bicycle as the technology of the past. The data shows otherwise. Half a century ago, world production of bikes and cars was about the same - 20 million each, per year. Production of cars has since tripled, but production of bicycles has increased twice as fast again - to around 120 million a year. And it is not absurd to suggest that bicycles are pointing the way yet again. As we seem to stand on the brink of an age of self-driving cars, many people expect that the vehicle of the future will not be owned, but rented, with the click of a smartphone app. If so, the vehicle of the future is here: globally well over a thousand bike-share schemes and tens of millions of dockless, easy-to-rent bikes are now thought to be in circulation, with numbers growing fast. You can even hire battery-powered models. Ride-sharing firm Uber has already announced that it plans to to focus more on its electric scooter and bike business, and less on cars. Some companies have experienced teething problems with the business model. Large number of bikes have been stolen, vandalised or abandoned, leading firms to pull back from operating in certain cities. However, the market seems set to grow, given that the bicycle is still often the quickest way to get around gridlocked areas. Many cyclists are discouraged only by diesel fumes and by the prospect of, like Monsieur Lallement, crashing. But if the next generation of automobile is a pollution-free electric model, driven by a cautious and considerate robot, it may be that the bicycle's popularity - just like Pierre Lallement on his downhill ride - is about to pick up speed.

"While iPhone sales dipped, the company made up the difference in higher revenues in services such as its software store and music service. Sales rose 1% to $53.8bn (£44.3bn), while net profit dropped 13% to $10bn. The company stemmed some of its drop in sales to China. The results beat Wall Street estimates and shares gained 3.5% to $216.10 in after-hours trading. For first time since 2012, iPhone sales represent less than half of company's overall sales. Sales of the device are down by $741m on this period last year. In China, sales fell 4% to $9.16bn, after a drop of 22% in the second quarter. Exchange rates have made the iPhone expensive for Chinese customers. Apple forecast sales of between $61bn and $64bn for the final three months of its financial year. You'll hear critics often say that Apple has failed too come up with anything interesting since the iPhone. And that Tim Cook, the man who took over from Steve jobs, is yet to come up with anything interesting at all. But that criticism is increasingly untrue, at least when it comes to Apple inventing new areas of business. This quarter underlines that: despite iPhone sales continuing to shrink, the firm's revenues are up, thanks to booming success with its Wearables, Home and Accessories category (so: Apple Watch, mostly, and AirPods) and continued growth of it Services (App Store, Apple Pay, Apple TV, Apple Music etc). The number of people paying Apple for some kind of subscription has risen by 55% in the past year to 420m. Apple expects that number to go up fairly dramatically over the next year thanks to the launch of its big-budget subscription TV service, Apple TV+. Even China brought somewhat good news for Apple this quarter. Sales were down 4% in the country, which the company is seeing as being much better as it could have been given the extreme turbulence created by the US-China trade war. If you remove the iPhone from the China figures, Apple's revenues there grew by 17%. That suggests a slowing upgrade cycle, but users still keen to use the iPhones they have and access Apple services. In short, Apple is in good health. The iPhone is a product in decline, and as a result, the company's profits have taken a hit. Investors understand that this is a firm in a transition, and so far it is going well.",Apple posted a small gain in sales for the third quarter of the year.
"Robert PestonEconomics editor Is it that those extra glasses of festive vino are supposed to improve powers of foresight? Or is there some magic in Christmas and Hanukkah that means whatever I was thinking two weeks earlier about what's happening in the world is changed in some mystical way? Bonkers. Unfortunately it is the expected bonkers. So here goes. First point. The economic recovery we've witnessed in almost all the developed and big economies this autumn will continue through most of 2014, and in some cases - including the UK's - may gain momentum. The ""flows"" in the global economy - temporarily at least - are not as strong a brake on growth as they were: the pace of tax rises and spending cuts has slowed almost everywhere; consumers are more confident, largely because there haven't been any truly hideous shocks for almost two years; and businesses are a bit more confident. And, of course, central banks have continued to create free money and cheap credit as if there is no tomorrow - to offset the intractable reluctance of commercial banks and financial institutions to create credit. Hey presto, this is the jolliest Yule for six years. And if you don't want to spoil the festive mood, stop reading now. Second point. The big structural flaws in most economies, and the global economy, are not mended, so - unless this coming year's more benign economic conditions are exploited to accelerate the remediation - the recovery could very easily start to peter out towards the end of 2014. Or to put it another way, the ""stock"" problem - excessive debts in Europe, Japan and (to a lesser extent) the US - is still with us. The lack of competitiveness of many western economies, the UK, France, even the US, has not been fixed. And because of the endemic weakness of the richer economies, China remains dangerously dependent on mind-bogglingly excessive, debt-fuelled investment to generate the rapid growth perceived necessary by its government (and one January treat for you - ha ha - will be a film I've made for BBC2 on whether the Chinese economic miracle is about to expire). To be clear, in a globalised world, we are all in this together. And the long-term sustainability of growth in both West and East would require two analogous changes: a greater willingness of Chinese people to consume, and an increased desire on our part to save, or cultural revolutions that would be the work of decades. The way I see all this, as you know (you really do, or you haven't been paying attention), is that there is far too much debt in the world, and far too little equity, because a) most rich economies have an extraordinary propensity to consume, b) our banks, till recently, fed this consumption with the frenzied provision of credit, c) we buy far more from the rest of the world than we sell to it, because our tradeable sector - especially in manufacturing - is too small. On this view, America's much more rapid recovery than Europe's is no mystery: it is because the debts of American households have fallen fairly rapidly since the 2008 global calamity; and because the notorious or celebrated fracking has made America much less dependent on expensive imported energy. Only France, with its vast nuclear generators, has relatively cheap energy within the EU. Importantly, European banks and insurers are - generally - weak, not capable of supplying vital credit to households and businesses (this is less of a problem in the UK). And the putative solution, a comprehensive ""asset quality review"" by the European Central Bank over the coming year, may for a time make banks more risk averse and reluctant to lend, so as to minimise the amount of expensive capital they may be forced to raise to fix their historic imprudence. Also, and to state the bleedin' obvious, European member states persist in maintaining the conceit that monetary union requires only very limited political and fiscal union. So, for example, a recently announced plan to tackle the problem of banks that are too big to fail, an agreement on new rules for limiting the impact on taxpayers when they do fail, keeps all the residual burden of rescuing banks on the home country's exchequer. With no explicit sharing of costs and risks by eurozone countries, the finances of the weaker economies - Spain, Italy, inter alia - will remain dangerously stretched. In those circumstances, of banks' viability in extremis resting on the questionable solvency of their home countries' governments, there is little prospect of banks in the weaker economies being able to borrow from markets cheaply or easily - in that the risks of banks' creditors losing money remain non-trivial. That in turn means that the weaker banks will remain unhealthily hooked on cheap funding from the European Central Bank, and will continue to find it hard to finance any fledgling economic recovery. Which I could have condensed by saying ""plus ca change..."" Hey presto: Europe is still flatlining, and America is growing at 3% per annum, or maybe a bit more. All of which creates something of a puzzle: why on earth is Britain growing at an almost identical pace to America, and pulling away from our confrere across the Channel? Yes, household debts in the UK have fallen relative to income, though not in absolute terms, and they remain high (140% of available income, more than £1.5 trillion). But, we don't have cheap energy (I didn't need to remind you of that, did I?). Also the gap between what we sell to the rest of the world and what we buy from it has actually been widening. And business investment has increased only very slightly. Or to put it another way, why are British consumers (is that you, by the way?) saving less and spending again? I wrote a bit about all this recently. But, silly me, I forgot quite an important stimulus - which has nothing to do with the Chancellor, or the Bank of England. You might call it a leaving present from the now defunct Financial Services Authority, because it was the decision in April 2011 of the FSA's then chief executive Hector Sants to force the banks to pay restitution for mis-selling PPI credit insurance. At the time the FSA estimated this would lead to the banks forking out ""just"" £4bn. This was a wild under-estimate. It is now clear the banks will be handing more than £16bn to their customers, which represents a boost to consumers' balances of around 1% of GDP. Since around three quarters of this PPI cash has been handed out over the past 18 months, this is probably the single biggest contributor to the revival of consumer spending. The banks' sins of the past transformed into a current virtue, thanks to the intermediation of the regulator. Wunderbar, surely. It's coming to an end of course (although the spam texts and cold calls from the dratted claims firms would make you think otherwise). Which is why it really matters that businesses, with their tails up a bit, become less risk averse and start investing. As it happens, the business leaders to whom I chat are remarkably bullish right now. And although this is hideously unscientific and ""intuitive"", my sense is that there are some legs to this recovery, for all the drag of a lamentable trade performance. So what's the biggest challenge or risk for 2014? It is the probable phasing out of money and cheap-debt creation by the US and UK central banks (there is no chance of that happening in the eurozone). Will the economies in the US and UK have achieved adequate lift-off velocity to withstand the choking off of the fuel of exceptional monetary stimulus? Gawd only knows, because this is genuinely uncharted territory. If you pressed me, I would say I doubt it, but I could be wrong (as if you doubted that).","So, for the avoidance of doubt, I hate this time of year - largely because of the convention, in the media, in business, in the City, that it is time to take stock and make predictions for the coming year."
"The PMI recorded a level of 52.3, down from from 53.8 in January, its lowest since August. However, the index remained above the 50 level which indicates growth. The index covers 16 leading emerging markets, including India, Brazil and China, which all saw their rate of growth fall. Rates of economic growth in these countries have been far higher than in developed nations, often coming in at about 10% a year. The eurozone and the UK have barely grown in recent years, while US growth has been in low, single figures. Investors have questioned whether emerging markets, whose growth depends in part on exports to mature markets, can continue to expand at such fast rates. Murat Ulgen, chief economist at HSBC, said: ""The slowdown appears to be broad-based across manufacturing and services, with BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India and China] activity moderating after a promising start to the new year."" New orders and employment levels both fell. Mr Ulgen said there were two possible outlooks for emerging economies: ""Either the emerging markets will wobble along, buffeted by worries in the developed world. ""Alternatively, the current slowdown will prove temporary, as the inventory cycle works its way through and improved underlying fundamentals bring back the days of strong growth.""","The economies of emerging markets grew at a slower pace in February than the month before, according to HSBC's monthly purchasing managers' index."
"Markit's composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the eurozone remained at 46.5 in April, unchanged from the month before. A reading below 50 indicates shrinking activity. The survey suggested that German private sector output fell for the first time since November last year. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: ""Previously, we've seen Germany expand while other countries have contracted - notably Spain, Italy and France. ""Now it seems those contractions are being accompanied by a downturn in the largest economy, Germany, and that will no doubt act as a drag on growth."" There was slightly better news from France, where the PMI survey indicated that the private sector contracted at a slower rate in April than before. Policy change? The European Central Bank (ECB) is meeting next week for its regular monthly monetary policy meeting, with eurozone interest rates currently at 0.75%. Mr Williamson warned that while the eurozone PMI figure had not worsened in April, there were signs that things could get worse in the future. ""The forward-looking indicators suggest there's risks to the downside for the contraction to gather pace,"" he said. The eurozone's economy is contracting, and shrank by 0.6% in the last quarter of 2012. Ben May, European economist at Capital Economics, said the survey could act as a nudge to the ECB to provide some further stimulus measures. ""[There are] further signs that the improvement in market sentiment alone will not be enough to drag the eurozone out of recession,"" he said. ""Given this, and the fact that inflation looks set to remain subdued, pressure on the ECB to provide additional policy support looks set to increase."" Earlier on Tuesday, a survey by HSBC indicated that growth in China's manufacturing sector slowed in April. The preliminary reading from HSBC's PMI survey fell to 50.5, from 51.6 in March, with a drop in new export orders blamed for the decline. The findings add to concerns about the country's economic recovery. China's growth rate slowed to an annual pace of 7.7% in the first three months of the year, down from 7.9% in the previous quarter.","Activity in the eurozone's services and manufacturing sectors continued to fall in April, a survey has indicated, with even German output declining."
"Official figures show the economy grew at a record 7.4% in the three months to 30 September from the prior quarter, when it suffered a severe decline. But output remained 2.9% lower compared to the same period a year ago. The data comes as analysts warn the rebound may be running out of steam. ""Overall, the initial recovery in GDP after the first wave of lockdowns were lifted was stronger than we originally anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics. ""But, with coronavirus infections hitting a record high in recent days and any additional fiscal stimulus unlikely to arrive until, at the earliest, the start of next year, further progress will be much slower."" The US was not hit as badly as many places this spring, when countries around the world went into lockdown. The economy shrank 9% in the second quarter, compared to a roughly 20% contraction in the UK, 13.8% decline in France and 9.7% fall in Germany. The initial US slump has been partially offset by the growth between June and September, which came as businesses reopened, employers recalled workers and shoppers returned to restaurants and stores - helped by trillions of dollars in government aid. On an annual basis - the way the US prefers to measure growth, which assumes such rates would continue for 12 months - the economy grew by some 33% in the third quarter, following a record 31% contraction in the second. But after the initial burst of activity, jobs growth has slowed and employers have yet to restore more than 10 million positions cut during the spring. Stimulus stalemate The unemployment rate stood at 7.9% last month, down from the 14.7% high recorded in April but still more than double the jobless rate in February. In recent weeks, major companies, including plane-maker Boeing, financial firm Charles Schwab, and media giant Walt Disney, have announced new job cuts. Oil giant Exxon on Thursday said it was slashing 1,900 jobs in the US. More than 750,00 people filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week and more than 22 million continue to collect some form of benefits, the US Labor Department said separately. ""As we move beyond the confinement and re-opening dynamics that drove violent swings in activity between March and September, the sober realities of the economic situation will become more apparent,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch. ""Growth is set to slow sharply, we are still a long way from normalisation and the surge in the virus cases means social distancing and all its related economic implications are here to stay."" Election politics The gross domestic product (GDP) figures - the broadest measure of economic activity - come less than a week before the US presidential election and as the debate in Washington about the need to fund additional coronavirus relief remains at an impasse. Republicans have pointed to the faster than expected recovery as a sign that more limited aid is appropriate for an economy on the mend. On Twitter, US President Donald Trump celebrated the growth, calling the third quarter gains the ""Biggest and Best in the History of our Country, and not even close"". ""Next year will be FANTASTIC!!!"" he added, while warning that a win by his challenger Joe Biden next week would ""kill it all"". But Democrats have called for more than $3tn in additional spending, saying Republican resistance to such a large relief package will hurt the economic rebound. ""Our nation still has a long way to go before we overcome this public health crisis and our economy fully recovers,"" New York Senator Chuck Schumer, who leads Democrats in the Senate, said on Thursday after the figures were announced. ""Much more needs to be done.""","The US economy emerged quickly from the depths of the crisis triggered by coronavirus lockdowns this spring, but full recovery remains out of reach."
"The firm, whose former boss Sir Martin Sorrell stepped down in April after a scandal, reported lower-than-expected third quarter sales and slashed its full-year outlook. The world's biggest adverting firm is overhauling its business amid mounting competition from Google and Facebook. New boss Mark Read called for ""radical thinking"" to turn the company around. ""Our industry is facing structural change, not structural decline, but in the past we have been too slow to adapt, become too complicated and have under-invested in core parts of our business,"" he said. ""There is much to do and we have taken a number of critical actions to address these legacy issues and improve our performance."" WPP said total group revenue fell by 0.8% in the three months to 30 September, as demand at its US and UK creative agencies dived. The British firm - which owns big-named agencies such as Ogilvy and JWT - said it would sell off more assets and hold back from making new acquisitions. Mr Read said WPP would offload its stake in data analytics group Kantar, which had revenues of £2.7bn last year. ""Preparations are underway, involving Kantar management, and unsolicited expressions of interest have been received,"" Mr Read said. This would allow it to pump cash into its businesses, particularly in its key North American business where sales are down 5.8% this year. Founded as a holding company in 1986, WPP's operations today span creative agencies, public relations, consultancy and data analytics. However, it has been struggling over the last few years amid mounting competition from tech platforms Facebook and Google as more advertising moves online. Traditional consultancies such as Deloitte are also entering the market while major clients such as Unilever are spending less on advertising. That said, WPP's results come after its peers - Omnicom, Interpublic and Publicis - all published third quarter updates that were well received. WPP said its sales could fall as much as 1% in 2018 compared with a target of 0.3% growth just three months ago. George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""We're yet to get the full details, but it looks like the over-riding theme of [Mark Read's] restructure will be a simplification of the business. It's easy to see why. ""Taking over at a group where success depends so much on having an in-depth knowledge of all the various agencies and divisions was always going to be a serious challenge. ""This journey has already started, and the decision to sell a stake in Kantar is the next step."" Sir Martin, who took WPP from a small engineering company and created the world's biggest ad agency, quit this year after facing a complaint of personal misconduct - which he vigorously denied. He has since formed rival venture S4 Capital and in July outbid his former company to buy the Dutch digital production company MediaMonks.",Shares in WPP have closed down nearly 14% after the advertising giant warned that growth in the business is slowing.
"The target is one of several set by Toyota, which also pledged to sell 1.5 million hybrid cars a year by 2020. Toyota said it will increase the use of renewable energy and hydrogen-based production methods at its factories. Separately it said it plans to sell more than 30,000 hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles around or shortly after 2020. Unveiling new environmental targets Toyota confirmed that its new Prius hybrid would be a fifth more fuel-efficient than its predecessor as the car manufacturer hopes to boost flagging sales of the environmentally friendly model amid a slump in global oil prices. Toyota said it planned to reduce average emissions from its cars by 90% by 2050 compared with 2010 levels. However, Toyota's plans did not include any commitment to manufacturing electric cars. The strategy outlined earlier on Wednesday came as Volkswagen said it would cut investment at its biggest division by €1bn (£743m) a year from 2019 and increase development of electric vehicles. The German company said on Tuesday it would speed up cost cutting at its VW division and put only the latest and ""best environmental technology"" in diesel vehicles. Volkswagen is facing the biggest crisis in its 78-year history after admitting last month it installed software in diesel vehicles that could deceive US environmental regulators about the true level of their toxic emissions.",Japanese car manufacturing giant Toyota is committing to all but eliminate carbon emissions from its production processes by 2050.
"The firm said it saw strong growth in the second quarter, with revenues of about $26bn (£19bn), up 21% compared to the same period in 2016. But profits for the three months to the end of June were $3.5bn, more than 40% lower than they would have been without the fine. Year-on-year profits fell almost 30%. Google was fined 2.42bn euros ($2.7bn; £2.1bn) by the European Commission last month after it ruled the company had abused its power by promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results. The amount was the regulator's largest penalty to date against a company accused of distorting the market. Alphabet has already said it may challenge the fine. Analysis by Dave Lee, North America technology reporter: Naturally, this quarter's earnings tell a very skewed picture of the health of Alphabet. It's been a terrific quarter which, were it not for that record breaking fine, would have exceeded expectations in almost every way. Google is appealing against that fine, so we could find at some point in the future those ""lost"" billions are added back on, making for a particularly bountiful quarter somewhere down the line. The company wants to keep an eye on its advertising business, however. The cost per click - i.e how much money Google makes with every ad click - has dropped by 23% year on year. That's much more than analysts had hoped. It's a sign that Google is having to work harder to keep those incredible revenues coming in. And if it is to comply with what it sees as overly strict European Commission measures, its ability to use its market power to dominate online advertising may be restricted. Just as well, then, that the non-advertising side of Alphabet is doing well too. On Monday, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said the firm was reviewing the decision and working on ways to address the regulator's concerns. She refused to comment further on how it could affect the business, describing it as an ongoing legal matter. ""The main thing is we're very focused on helping users and advertisers and are reviewing our options,"" she said. The tech giant's shares, which had risen ahead of the firm's publication of its earnings, fell more than 3% in after-hours trading. Some said that was a sign shareholders were cashing in. 'Strong growth' Alphabet makes most of its money from advertising. It said revenues from advertisers on its own sites, such as YouTube and Gmail, and other sites together increased 18% year-on-year to $22.7bn. YouTube, for example, now has about 1.5bn monthly viewers, who watch an average of 60 minutes a day, said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai. The firm has also been working to diversify its revenue stream, investing in areas such as driverless cars, cloud services and life sciences that it says are united by the opportunities presented by machine learning. Alphabet's other revenues - which include money from things such as app purchases and its cloud services - jumped more than 40% to about $3bn. ""We're delivering strong growth with great underlying momentum, while continuing to make focused investments in new revenue streams,"" Ms Porat said.","Profits at Alphabet, the parent company of search giant Google, have been hit by the record fine imposed by the European Commission last month."
"By Ramzan KarmaliBusiness reporter, BBC News Mr Bhatia was not just shocked by the amount that was being asked for, £100, but because he thought he had done everything possible to avoid getting stung. ""I saw the restriction there. As I was definitely going to be there for more than 60 minutes, I asked the staff if I could park the car for more than 60 minutes. ""And the staff said, 'Yes, you can park it'. Had they declined my request, I would have gone back to the car and driven off,"" he told the BBC. In the majority of cases, the car parks are run by a third-party company. This was true for Mr Bhatia as well. He immediately contacted McDonald's, which advised him to contact the operator concerned, MET Parking. So what are your rights should you find yourself dealing with a private parking operator? Appeal procedure Mr Bhatia is not alone. Around 1.8 million parking charge notices are issued to motorists who have been deemed to be parked illegally on private land. But when it comes to fighting such charges, he is in the minority. Only 13,415 go through the official appeal procedures. The body that oversees the way private car parks are run, the British Parking Association, believes that the appeals process is fair and relatively easy to navigate. It points out that almost half of all appeals find in favour of the motorist. BPA chief executive Patrick Troy says private car parking companies are considerate. ""One of the things we've done is to establish an independent appeals service with independent redress for motorists,"" he says. ""That's a really important benefit for motorists, to protect their interests when they get tickets in those circumstances."" This appeal service is free and run by an organisation called Parking on Private Land Appeals (Popla). Mr Troy would like all private car park operators to use it. Currently, many car parks at railway stations and airports do not use Popla and so motorists cannot use its appeal service. Your rights Wheel-clamping on private land in England and Wales has been illegal since October 2012. In Scotland, clamping on private land has been banned since 1992. Northern Ireland has a code of practice. Parking control companies are legally allowed to pursue motorists for any unpaid parking charge notices. However, parking enforcement on private land is unregulated and it relies on the laws of contract and trespass. Motorists are deemed to have accepted the parking terms and sanctions if there is adequate signage. Several organisations, including the AA, have campaigned for private parking to be regulated, but this has not happened. Operators are also within their rights to send you a ticket through the post. The AA advises motorists not to pay any money on the spot. All bona fide operators will allow you to pay by post. If you disagree with the ticket, the AA suggests you should gather any evidence, such as photographs. You should then follow the instructions on the ticket concerning the appeals procedure. Campaigner and author of the book, ""The Parking Ticket Awards: Crazy Councils, Meter Madness and Traffic Warden Hell"", Barrie Segal, is not convinced that the industry is fair to motorists. He also does not believe we should ignore these tickets, but at the same time doesn't believe POPLA's appeal service is the only route to follow. His advice is to get your case heard and not get bogged down in a stream of continuous letter writing. Mr Segal says this is what you should tell the parking company: ""I want my day in court, if you're going to pursue this. If you go to court, I want you to demonstrate: 1) There was a contract 2) That you're entitled to receive the money 3) That it isn't a penalty and 4) That what you've asked for is a genuine pre-estimated loss"" Apology McDonald's told the BBC that it does not profit from operations run by MET Parking. But it did say that it had to impose parking restrictions because of mini-cab drivers using its car parks as waiting bays. It also said that some motorists have left their cars outside MacDonald's while using nearby airports or shopping centres. ""In each of our restaurants where parking restrictions have been introduced, we work with industry-approved contractors to make the parking policy as fair and as clearly communicated as possible,"" a spokesperson said. However, after being contacted by the BBC, McDonald's did issue an apology and cancelled Mr Bhatia's parking charge. Others may not be quite so fortunate.",Moez Bhatia received a nasty surprise in the post last month - a parking ticket for leaving his car for more than an hour at a McDonald's car park.
"Urban areas in Scotland and southern England have seen the biggest declines in job postings, according to the Centre for Cities (CfC) think tank. Vacancies have failed to return to pre-pandemic levels across all 63 towns and cities it analysed across the UK. CfC boss Andrew Carter said local lockdowns, while necessary, will exacerbate the situation over winter. The slow jobs recovery is linked to a ""collapse"" in the number of jobs in services being advertised, CfC said. Aberdeen, where the oil industry has struggled during the pandemic, recorded the steepest fall, with a 75% decline in job vacancies at the beginning of October, compared to the same time last year. It is followed by Edinburgh at 57%, and both Belfast and Crawley, a West Sussex town near Gatwick Airport, at 55%. London has seen the sixth biggest fall in job postings at 52%. Overall, UK vacancies are 46% behind last year's level, said the report from the think tank and jobs website Indeed. Andrew Carter, chief executive of Centre for Cities, said: ""This could have potentially catastrophic long-term consequences for people and the economy. ""The government has told us to expect a tough winter and while local lockdowns are necessary to protect lives, it is vital that ministers continue to listen and reassess the level of support given to help people and places to cope with the months ahead."" 'Long winter' for unemployed The think tank's analysts said in general, the lag in hiring was concentrated in sectors exposed to Covid-19 restrictions, such as retail, arts and leisure. Stricter coronavirus rules are now in force for nearly six million Britons. They also said working from home was stifling industries which depended on High Street footfall. Areas where footfall has returned to normal more quickly, such as Birkenhead, Chatham and Hull, have seen a faster recovery in the number of jobs advertised. Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: ""The timid recovery in job vacancies is a portent of the distress towns and cities could face if restrictions continue to spring up in parts of the country already reeling from imposed lockdowns and reduced footfall."" ""With the remote work trend showing no sign of abating, and entire regions being placed under stricter control, service jobs in large towns and cities could become scarcer still and pull the UK into a jobs spiral,"" Mr Adrjan said. ""That could mean a very long winter ahead for the millions of people currently unemployed,"" he added. The UK unemployment rate stood at 4.5% in the three months to August - the highest level seen in over three years. According to the Office for National Statistics, an estimated 1.5 million people were out of work and job hunting between June and August. A spokesperson for the Treasury said it had put in place a comprehensive plan to protect and create jobs in every region of the UK, and increased the generosity of its winter support schemes. ""We are also providing additional funding for local authorities and devolved administrations to support local businesses,"" they added.","Deserted High Streets and home working are stifling the British job market's recovery, new research suggests."

"However, chief executive David Solomon also distanced the bank from the scheme, which saw billions embezzled from the state development fund, 1MDB. He said Goldman, which had helped to raise money for the fund, had been deceived about details of the deals. Malaysia filed criminal charges against Goldman last month. It accused the investment bank of helping to misappropriate money intended for the fund. The US and other countries are also investigating its role. Tim Leissner, who served as Goldman's South East Asia chairman, pleaded guilty in the US last month for his role in the money laundering and bribery scheme. Mr Leissner left Goldman in 2016. On a call with financial analysts Mr Solomon said: ""It is very clear that the people of Malaysia were defrauded by many individuals,"" he said. ""For Leissner's role in that fraud, we apologise to the Malaysian people,"" he said. He added that Mr Leissner and others had deliberately concealed parts of the deal from Goldman employees charged with reviewing it. 'Difficult time' The scandal has hurt the bank's reputation, but the overall impact on client relationships has been minimal, he added. ""This has been a difficult time, but I'm proud about how our firm has remained focused on our clients,"" he said. Goldman helped raise money for 1MDB, by underwriting more than $6bn in bonds in three separate offerings between 2012 and 2013. It earned $600m for that work, according to authorities. Much of the money intended for the fund was allegedly embezzled and used to buy art, property, a private jet - and even to finance the Wolf of Wall Street film starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Malaysia's former prime minister, Najib Razak is among those who have been accused of pocketing the money. He has pleaded not guilty. That case is scheduled for trial in Malaysia later this year.",Goldman Sachs new boss has apologised to Malaysia for the role an ex-partner played in the corruption scandal at one of the country's wealth funds.
"It has published measures to ""hamper aggressive tax planning"". One proposal is for tax authorities to share information on multinationals among themselves, as agreed in the OECD deal signed by 31 nations on Wednesday. However, the UK Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted to ""see that information made public,"" in line with the Conservative Party's manifesto. The Commission said it was currently looking at the issue of public country-by-country reporting and will publish its findings the spring. Billions of euros are currently lost to tax avoidance every year, according to the Commission. The proposals come amid criticism of Google's £130m deal with UK tax authorities to settle a back tax bill. On Wednesday, 31 OECD members signed an agreement reached last October laying out new rules to stop companies using complex tax arrangements to avoid paying corporation tax. The idea is to make it harder for firms to hide money in tax havens or play one country's tax authority against another. And the European Commission says its anti tax avoidance package also calls on EU members to take a ""stronger and more coordinated stance against companies that seek to avoid paying their fair share of tax"". Key measures The key points laid out in today's Commission statement include: The Commissioner for economic and financial affairs, taxation and custom Pierre Moscovici said billions of tax euros were lost to tax avoidance every year: ""Money that could be used for public services like schools and hospitals or to boost jobs and growth. ""Europeans and businesses that play fair end up paying higher taxes as a result. This is unacceptable and we are acting to tackle it"".",The European Commission has stepped up efforts to tackle tax avoidance.
"The stock dropped around 5% in its first day of conditional trading to 235p, after being priced at 250p per share by the firm. Shares opened at 244p and dropped as low as 231p at one point, even though it had been over-subscribed. Its owners, private equity firms Permira, Charterhouse and CVC, sold their entire stakes in the AA. The motoring association initially said the company would be valued at about £1.385bn, but its market capitalisation dropped to £1.313bn on Monday. Institutional investors, including Aviva, Blackrock, Legal & General, Invesco, and Lansdowne Partners, backed a management buy-in led by former Green Flag boss Bob MacKenzie, who has been appointed as the AA's executive chairman. ""We will work with the existing management and the AA's loyal workforce to deliver an enhanced experience for all our members and customers, and to serve the broader needs of the UK motorist,"" Mr MacKenzie said in a statement. ""Our offer will enable the AA to become an independent publicly-listed company and we look forward to creating substantial value for all our stakeholders."" The firm's stock market flotation echoed that of sister company Saga, which closed flat on its debut. The AA was formed by motoring enthusiasts in 1905 primarily to avoid police speed traps. It is best known for its breakdown recovery service, but also sells insurance and financial products. The organisation voted to demutualise in 1999 and to be acquired by Centrica for £1.1bn. Private equity forms CVC and Permira bought the company from Centrica for £1.75bn in October 2004.",Shares in the AA motoring group suffered a disappointing debut on the London Stock Exchange.
"The announcement sent ructions through the retail sector, with Tesco shares sinking 5% and Sainsbury's down 4%. Marks and Spencer, which also has a sizable food business, fell 2%. Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said the deal was ""yet another signal of the seismic shift in the market caused by the Amazon model"". Shares in Morrisons, the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain which has its own tie-up with Amazon, fell sharply at first before recovering to close 1% higher. ""Whole Foods has just nine stores in the UK so the impact on Morrisons... should not be too significant, and if anything could support Morrisons if it signals how Amazon might be able to help it grow market share,"" Mr Wilson said. The FTSE 100 share index closed up 44.18 points at 7,463.54. Away from the retail sector, shares in Rolls-Royce rose 1.4% after the engineering group said it had made a good start to 2017, with ""all businesses performing in line with expectations"". The company also revealed that the weakness of the pound was set to lift revenues by £400m and profits by £50m. The drop in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote means that Rolls-Royce's dollar earnings are worth more when converted back into sterling. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.2% against the dollar to $1.2787, but slipped 0.16% against the euro to 1.1424 euros.",Shares in some of the UK's leading supermarkets fell sharply on the news that online retail giant Amazon is buying upmarket grocer Whole Foods.
"Earlier this week, the price of Brent crude oil fell below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009. The RAC said there should be a 3p a litre drop for petrol prices and 5p for diesel, taking the average price to 103p and 104p respectively. But it expects prices will be lower than this at many forecourts. ""All we need is for the supermarkets to do the right thing and embrace the season of goodwill by passing on those savings at the pump to make Christmas that much cheaper for everyone,"" said RAC spokesman Simon Williams. ""We are still some way off the average price of unleaded reaching the £1 a litre mark but this will be a big step in the right direction,"" he added. Tesco and Asda, which ran a three-day 99.7p a litre petrol promotion last month, have already cut petrol prices by 2p per litre, while Sainsbury's said it would cut prices by ""up to 2p"". According to RAC figures, the last time petrol fell below £1 a litre was in 2008. Tumbling oil Since June 2014, oil prices have more than halved, falling from more than $115 per barrel to under $40 on Monday. Historically, oil cartel Opec has cut production to support prices, but so far the group has not made any changes. On Friday, the group agreed again to maintain supply at current levels. ""If retailers don't pass on the savings quickly, they will be giving themselves an unpopular Christmas boost to profits by pocketing the extra margin when they should really be passing this on to their customers instead,"" Mr Williams added.","Petrol should drop to £1 a litre before Christmas if retailers ""do the right thing"" and pass on savings from the lower oil price, the RAC has predicted."
"By Jerome WirawanJakarta, Indonesia From her office near the Indonesian capital's landmark Hotel Indonesia roundabout, the 24-year-old needed to cover the 30km (19 miles) to Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in under an hour. In a city notorious for its endless traffic jams it seemed impossible. However, as Ms Hauser was travelling light, one of her colleagues suggested that she tried a new mobile phone-based motorcycle taxi service called Go-Jek. Downloading the app, Ms Hauser used her smart phone to book and pay for a scooter to take her to the airport. Within minutes a Go-Jek rider turned up, and she hopped on the back. After a journey weaving around cars and lorries that perhaps wasn't suitable for those of a nervous disposition, Ms Hauser did indeed get to the airport on time. ""I was very content, and since then have become a regular Go-Jek customer,"" she says. Commission model The brainchild of 30-year-old Indonesian entrepreneur Nadiem Makarim, the Go-Jek app has been downloaded more than 500,000 times since the service launched in Jakarta at the start of this year. Mr Makarim claims that no other app in Indonesia has reached half a million downloads so quickly. With no money spent on advertising, the success has solely come thanks to positive world of mouth. While motorcycle taxis, known locally as ojek, have long been a popular form of transport in Jakarta, Go-Jek is the first attempt to introduce a hi-tech booking system and guaranteed service standards. Outside of Go-Jek, ojek riders congregate on street corners, and are not officially registered. Payments have to be made in cash, and prices are a matter of negotiation. By contract, Go-Jek recruits and trains its staff, who get uniforms, helmets, and a smart phone on which they manage their pick ups. The company also sets standard fare levels, and provides its drivers with insurance. Go-Jek now has no less than 10,000 riders on its books, based not just in Jakarta, but also across the cities of Bandung and Surabaya, and the island of Bali. The company makes its money by taking a 20% commission from each journey. Delivery men Mr Makarim has been a regular ojek user since his early 20s, but he admits that his childhood journeys were often a lot more luxurious. Born into an affluent Indonesian family, he would be taken to primary school in Jakarta in a chauffeur-driven car. Mr Markarim was then educated overseas, attending high schools in both New York and Singapore, before going to Brown University in the US state of Rhode Island to study international relations. This was followed by getting a master of business administration degree from Harvard University in Boston. Returning to Indonesia to work as a management consultant in Jakarta, the idea of creating Go-Jek came to him when he was speaking with his regular ojek rider. Mr Markarim says: """"I asked him, 'how long do you work?'. ""The ojek driver said he normally works 14 hours a day. ""And, I also asked him how many orders he normally took in a day. He said about four or five, so it meant that for 70% to 75% of his work hours, he's not actually working, he just sits there waiting for customers."" Realising that there was a problem of supply and demand, Mr Markarim realised that developing a phone app could better connect would-be passengers with ojek riders, and via versa. He also decided that passengers would like to see an increased level of trust and accountability. Therefore the app allows customers to see the distance to their destination, and calculate the exact cost of the journey. For each kilometre (0.6 miles) travelled with Go-Jek, customers are charged 4,000 rupiah (29 cents; 20p). Mr Markarim also came up with the idea of utilising Go-Jek riders as a fleet of delivery men, and even personal shoppers. So instead of just using Go-Jek to transport themselves, customers can book a Go-Jek driver to collect a takeaway for them, or even do a food shop. Mr Markarim says this gives the riders a new revenue steam, especially in times of the day when demand for passengers is low. ""This way, ojek drivers do not just earn money during rush hours,"" he says. 'My legacy' To launch Go-Jek Mr Markarim quit a secure full-time job. Despite having recently married at the time, he felt it was a risk worth taking. With the business proving a big success so far, he is proud of what he is achieving. ""We only live once,"" he says. ""What do I want to tell to my grandkids about what I have done? Is it that I've made money or invented something that changed an industry forever? ""For me what I have been doing is a lot more than just making money. This is about what I leave as my legacy when I'm no longer around in this world."" Mr Markarim, who has since accepted investment from friends and other investors, now plans to expand his business operations by releasing a sister app called Go-Truk. Go-Truk aims to show which lorries in Jakarta have spare space, which can then be more easily hired out.","With Jakarta's traffic gridlocked in the middle of a Friday afternoon rush hour, German expat Jana Hauser thought she had little chance of catching her flight."
"Prof Duflo, only the second woman to win the economics award, told the BBC she hoped it demonstrated practical ways to improve lives. She shared the award with her husband, Abhijit Banerjee, and Michael Kremer. Their work has focused on poor communities in India and Kenya. Research into how teachers can improve classroom education or how to raise healthcare standards in poor areas was having real-world practical benefits, said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize. Prof Duflo told the BBC that she and her fellow prize winners took a more practical approach than many economists who had won the award previously. For example, an experiment in schools in India dispensed with a focus on the curriculum, to concentrate on children left behind in their studies. ""That doesn't look like rocket science,"" she said. ""It looks obvious. But nobody in India accepted that as a legitimate approach."" Armed with evidence that their methods work, she said, it was easier to convince policymakers. The economists have also, for example, looked into areas such as class sizes and comparisons between experienced and inexperienced teachers. While the former have obvious benefits, the later compensated for their lack of experience with energy and enthusiasm, she said. The challenge of their work was to prove it. Not enough women Prof Duflo said: ""If you want to really make a dent in fighting poverty and the problems that go with it you really have to approach it problem-by-problem. Try to put away your preconceptions, and instead try and bring in a scientific and vigorous mindset. The key is experiment."" She said that winning the award was incredibly humbling, and completely unexpected because ""usually a Noble prize goes to a male economist over the age of 60"". Not only is the professor just the second women to win the award since it began in 1969, at the age of 46 she is also the youngest winner - male or female. The three academics will share prize money of nine million Swedish krona (£728,000). ""We will put it [the money] to good use and make the best of it in our work,"" she told the BBC. ""But this is way beyond the money. The influence that this prize will have will give us a megaphone. We will really try to make good use of that megaphone to amplify the work of everyone who works with us."" She also hopes the prize will send a message to other women economists. ""There just are not enough of us,"" she said. One reason for this is the culture - ""a little bit macho and aggressive,"" she said. Another reason is that ""young women are not necessarily inspired by economics as something that could make a difference in the world. They think that if they want to be useful they should become doctors or maybe scientists - but not economists."" She hopes the award will show women that economics ""is not just about wearing ties and suits, and thinking about the macro economy and finance. It can be about changing the world - making the world a better place"".","Economics Nobel prize winner Esther Duflo says she wants to use the award ""as a megaphone"" in her fight to ease poverty and improve children's education."
"The UK's second biggest construction firm went into liquidation on Monday, after running up losses on contracts and struggling with heavy debts. The business secretary has asked for an investigation by the Official Receiver to be broadened and fast-tracked. The conduct of directors in charge at the time of the company's failure and previous directors will be examined. Carillion's business is now in the hands of the official receiver, which is reviewing all of Carillion's contracts. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, 20,000 in the UK, and had 450 contracts with the UK government. The government has said that staff and contractors working on public sector service contracts will continue to be paid. But there is concern that big projects, including the construction of hospitals and roads, will be delayed while the details are worked out. There are also big worries for an estimated 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector. Many are owed money and face a wait to find out if they will get any of it back. On Monday the government said that firms working on Carillion's private contracts would be paid for another 48 hours. But the latest statement from the Insolvency Service indicates there might be more flexibility. It says that the Liquidator is talking to Carillion's private sector clients about which services will continue; however contracts will be ended if the client no longer wants to pay for them. ""No one has been dismissed at this point and staff will continue to be paid for the work they perform,"" a spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said. 'I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday' Andy Bradley is the managing director of Flora-tec, which is owed £800,000 by Carillion for landscaping services. ""The government actively encouraged businesses like mine... to get involved in public sector contracts, to make sure the little guy got a slice of the pie. ""When Carillion started to get into trouble last year we were considering that we would scale back our involvement with them. ""However... the government continued to give them billion-pound contract after billion-pound contract and that said to me, as a small supplier, that the government had done their due diligence. ""We were following the government lead... only to be given a sucker punch. ""I had to make 10 people redundant yesterday. That's 10 people with mortgages, car loans, all that stuff. It's an absolute disgrace."" Carillion was hit by cost overruns on big projects, problems with contracts in the Middle East and a large deficit in the company pension scheme. In particular three building projects in the UK had resulted in hefty losses: Chief executive Richard Howson stepped down in July last year after a profit warning. He had been in charge since the end of 2011. Keith Cochrane was appointed as interim chief executive. There has been much criticism over the size of Mr Howson's pay award in 2016 which, including bonuses, totalled about £1.5m. He is also due to receive a salary until October this year. Finance director Richard Adam, who retired in December 2016 after nine years at Carillion received almost £1.1m in salary and bonuses in 2016. Government 'too close' As well as the conduct of directors, the role of Carillion's auditor KPMG will be examined by the Financial Reporting Council. ""It is important we quickly get the full picture of the events which caused Carillion to enter liquidation,"" said Business Secretary, Greg Clark, in a statement. ""Any evidence of misconduct will be taken very seriously,"" he said. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government had become ""too close"" to Carillion. ""We need full transparency on meetings and discussions that took place between government ministers, civil servants and representatives of Carillion and what warnings were given to ministers and what actions recommended implemented or not,"" he said. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss described his comments as ""cheap political shots"". Are you a Carillion employee or contractor?

"It follows action by the Competition and Markets Authority, which received hundreds of complaints. The regulator said that LoveHolidays had told customers asking for a refund on flights that they would only receive it when the firm received money back from the airlines. LoveHolidays has now committed to repay customers in full by March 2021. The CMA said it would allow the company that time in order for it to manage its financial position. But it warned LoveHolidays: ""If the firm fails to repay customers by these dates, the CMA is prepared to take the company to court."" So far, £7m has been refunded to 20,000 of the 44,000 customers identified by the CMA. Apologies LoveHoldays told the BBC it had been ""working tirelessly since March to do everything we can to ensure our customers receive their money"". It said it had refunded more than £205m owed to more than 180,000 customers, which, it added, was the equivalent of 10 years' worth of refunds in eight months. It apologised it had taken much longer than normal to process refunds. Under the Package Travel Regulations, online travel agents are legally bound to refund customers for package holidays cancelled due to coronavirus, regardless of whether or not the agent has received money back from suppliers, for example airlines. Summer holidays - or lack of them - feel like a lifetime ago for most people. But for those still waiting for a refund, the financial pinch will undoubtedly be felt at this expensive time of year. They will be frustrated that LoveHolidays has been given nearly four more months to pay up in full. The rules state they should have been refunded within 14 days. They are suffering from the tension within the industry, with under-pressure package holiday firms having to pay refunds, but they - in turn - have been waiting for money back from the airlines for cancelled flights. The summer break proved to be more of a summer breakdown for everyone involved. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said: ""Travel agents have a legal responsibility to make prompt refunds to customers whose holidays have been cancelled due to coronavirus. ""We are continuing to investigate package travel firms and where we find evidence that businesses are breaching consumer law, we will not hesitate to take enforcement action to protect consumers."" It marks the latest action taken by the CMA against holiday firms over failed refunds for trips cancelled due to the coronavirus crisis. The CMA has already secured refund commitments from Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, Tui's UK business, Sykes Cottages and Vacation Rentals. It has also written to more than 100 package holiday firms to remind them of the consumer protection laws. What are my rights? Did you book with LoveHolidays?

"By Howard MustoeBusiness reporter If you do, you are probably in a minority, according to Simon Harrington, senior policy adviser at the PIMFA, the trade association for firms that provide investment management and financial advice. Part of it is to do with automatic enrolment. Since 2012, workers in most companies have been automatically signed up to a workplace pension without having to lift a finger. This has swelled the number of people with a workplace pension by about 8.5 million to 19.2 million. ""The whole point of automatic enrolment is that basically, people save up [by] doing nothing at all,"" says Mr Harrington. ""People will know, in most cases by looking at their pay every month that some money has gone into a pension scheme. But all of the data that we have suggests that they really never log on, check their annual benefit statement, or have any idea of what it is that they're invested in."" This isn't a disaster, he says. The default fund into which their money is placed is generally cheap to manage and receives a lot of attention because of its size. But it means that many people are invested in a pot of very disparate interests, which may include tobacco, gambling, firearms, alcohol, oil or other investments that they may personally want to avoid. Part of that is down to the rules for this large pool of pensions. A default fund - the one your money is invested in if you take no action - can only charge a maximum of 0.75% a year, which means a lot of it will follow stock indexes like London's FTSE 100, FTSE 250 or the S&P 500 in the US - so-called passive investments which will include a vast number of companies. Ethical funds, which avoid investing in these companies, do exist, though, and they are growing in popularity, albeit from a low base. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, one of the largest do-it-yourself investment platforms, says the number of ethical funds it offers has almost tripled in the past 12 months, and there's more than 11 times more money in these funds than a year ago. There are now close to 200 such funds, but that's out of 3,500 funds on the platform overall. Pension providers are taking action, though. The biggest by membership is Nest, which has 9.8 million members and oversees £16.5bn of savings. It has already acted and scrubbed its investments of tobacco and uranium. It has a 10-year plan to cut emissions and wants companies it owns shares in to cut out Arctic drilling and coal. Pension companies insist that there is interest in ethical investments. The BBC asked some of the UK's largest pension providers how many workplace pension funds they offered and how many were ethical. Of the six that came back to us, we found that on average one ethical fund was offered for every 15 regular funds. Several insist that all their investments now follow some pattern of green or ethical investing. Legal & General Investment Management says all its default investments avoid controversial weapons and companies that purely mine coal. Aegon says half of pension savings using its default fund will soon be in ethical investments and that it plans to slash carbon emissions in its investments. Aviva says it has set a target for its default fund to be carbon neutral by 2050. It wants regulators to force its competitors to do the same. A challenge for savers is that there's no agreed-upon definition for what qualifies for an ethical investment. And switching to an ethical fund may not provide the best financial returns. Another challenge is finding those cheap funds which track an index, says Hector McNeil, co-chief executive of European investment platform HANetf. While there are cheap international funds which exclude tobacco, for instance, such funds are harder to come by in the UK. Much more choice and customisation is likely to be available in the future, he says. ""I think in three years' time we're going to be talking a totally different story,"" he says. He thinks most products will eventually allow customers to veto certain industries at will. Mr McNeil's company has grown from managing $50m (£35m) to $2.25bn (£1.6bn) in a little over a year. It designs funds and rose to prominence with a tradable fund investing in gold. ""You're getting more, broader, products,"" he says. Many of his funds are based around themes, such as ethical gold or medicinal cannabis, or removing carbon, If you take a look at the funds in your pension you may find it hard to tell where the money is. Many funds only list their 10 largest investments, leaving the majority of the value unaccounted for. Unless it explicitly promises to avoid a certain investment, it could be lurking in there. With funds like his, which can be traded on stock exchanges, all investments are listed, he says, making it easy to check where your money is held. Even then, mistakes are made. In 2019, fund manager Vanguard accidentally invested in gun-maker Sturm Ruger for a month before correcting the mistake. Despite the challenges and the inertia of some savers PIMFA's Simon Harrington is upbeat about ethical investing. ""The UK pension saving population is reasonably young,"" he says. Before workers were automatically added to workplace schemes, ""the number of people actively saving into a pension scheme was very, very small,"" he says. ""And we have to be realistic about the fact that we're at the start of a journey to a more developed saving culture."" The demand for ethical investments in personal savings like individual savings accounts (Isas) is a good indicator for what may be to come, he says.","Perhaps during lockdown, you've been tempted to do some financial spring cleaning and checked in on a private pension. But do you know what companies you're actually investing in?"
"A survey of 25,000 people found 79% were satisfied overall with services, the lowest since 2008, with more than one in five passengers not satisfied. Worsening punctuality, last summer's timetable chaos and strikes are among the reasons for the fall. Rail firms Northern and Great Northern saw the biggest drops in satisfaction. Comparing autumn 2018 with autumn 2017, two of the 25 train operating companies (TOCs), Heathrow Express and Chiltern Railways, ""significantly improved"". Heathrow Express scored the highest rating of 96%. But over the same period seven operators ""significantly declined"": Great Northern, which had the lowest rating of 68%, Northern, TransPennine Express, Greater Anglia, Thameslink, ScotRail and London North Eastern Railway. Last year, Northern services were affected by engineering overruns, an unusually high amount of leaves on tracks and strikes, as well as the timetable chaos in May that affected all train operators. Other findings from the Transport Focus survey included: Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: ""Government and the industry must continue to focus on performance. In the longer term, the government's Rail Review must bring about fundamental change. ""Passenger irritation at poor performance erodes their most basic trust in the industry. Passenger frustration at continual fare increases saps confidence in the system to reform itself. ""Passenger anger during the summer timetable crisis was palpable."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Passenger satisfaction is an absolute priority for the department, which is why we've introduced new measures on compensation, an independent rail ombudsman and commissioned an independent root and branch review of our railway. ""The survey did find that four out of five journeys are rated satisfactory, and our record £48bn investment will help to modernise the network and deliver significant improvements in performance, punctuality and capacity across the country."" Jacqueline Starr, managing director of customer experience at industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""Punctuality is the bedrock of satisfaction for our customers and at the moment in too many places, we are not getting it right. ""Working together, we are investing billions of pounds in a long-term plan to rebuild key parts of the network to improve punctuality while putting thousands of new and refurbished carriages on track to make journeys more comfortable.""

"By Jonathan JosephsBusiness reporter, BBC News Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said ""a phenomenon where rich countries are vaccinating their populations and poor countries have to wait"" must be avoided. In recent weeks, several countries have tried to prevent the export of vaccines made within their borders. But Dr Okonjo-Iweala said protectionism would hinder a global recovery. ""The nature of the pandemic and the mutation of many variants makes this such that no one country can feel safe until every country has taken precautions to vaccinate its population,"" she said. Vaccine boss Until the end of last year Dr Okonjo-Iweala chaired the global vaccine alliance, GAVI, which aims to increase access to vaccines around the world and she now says the WTO has crucial work to do in this area. There is an ongoing debate about relaxing WTO rules on intellectual property so that more drug manufacturers can make the jabs. Dr Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged that whilst ""some developing countries are asking for waivers, developed countries feel that this might impinge on intellectual property"". But she argues for ""a third way, in which we can licence manufacturing to countries so that you can have adequate supplies while still making sure that intellectual property issues are taken care of"". That is already happening with the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine, which has been licenced to the Serum Institute of India. While the pandemic is the most pressing challenge facing the WTO's new leader, it is not the only one. The organisation is in a fight for relevance in the eyes of many countries that consider its rules outdated and believe that the organisation itself has been slow to adapt to changes in the global economy. After a selection process which was dragged out by a lack of support from the administration of former US President Donald Trump, Dr Okonjo-Iweala is mindful of what her victory represents. ""I'm proud to be the first woman and the first African,"" she said. The reformer However, she is keen to get to work as a reformer, a reputation she earned when she was second in command at the World Bank, and as Nigeria's Finance Minister, where she won significant reductions in her country's international debt obligations. She said: ""There is an issue of broken trust between members and a lot of work [to be done] to update the rules of the WTO to [meet] 21st century realities."" If the challenges of coronavirus can be tackled, those ""small steps, early wins and successes can then help create the trust and allow you to do the bigger reforms"", she said. Among those challenges is an elusive deal on fishing subsidies. ""From there, we can go on to reform the dispute settlement system, which is moribund at the moment, but which is needed, because that's the only place in the world where members can bring trade disputes."" It was brought to a halt by President Trump vetoing the appointment of new judges to the body tasked with solving those disagreements. ""From there, we can go on to update the rules on areas like the digital economy and e-commerce,"" she said, adding that she also wanted to change the way women are served by the WTO and how climate change and trade are thought about. US-China trade war The US-China trade war is another area where the WTO has struggled to have an impact, given its lack of enforcement mechanisms. And that is despite a ruling last year that US tariffs were ""inconsistent"" with international trade rules. Dr Okonjo-Iweala said: ""We can be very helpful to both the US and China to help bring them together to solve these problems."" One reason the WTO has struggled to make progress in many areas is because of the insistence that decisions be made by the consensus of all 164 members. When asked if decisions should be taken on a majority, rather than consensus basis, Dr Okonjo-Iweala said: ""It should not be such that this manner of decision making gets in the way of welfare enhancing innovations or measures for the membership.""",The newly-appointed head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has told the BBC that vaccine protectionism must be overcome to solve the pandemic.
"It relates to a protracted dispute with hedge funds demanding payment of $1.3bn (£766m) on bonds they hold from a default 13 years ago. The hedge funds had won a ruling in the US preventing Argentina distributing interest payments to all bondholders. The court barred some banks from making payments on $29bn of bonds. But the bill is designed to side-step this. It would allow Argentina to make payments locally or in jurisdictions beyond the reach of the US courts. The bill still needs to be signed off by President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who has described the hedge funds as ""vultures"" and accused the court of interfering in an issue of national sovereignty. Argentina fell into default again in July after District Judge Thomas Griesa barred the Bank of New York Mellon from transferring an interest payment to bondholders unless Argentina settled with the hedge funds. The hedge fund investors bought Argentine government bonds at a big discount after the 2001 default. They rejected the terms of a restructuring and are demanding a full 100% repayment of the debt. If overseas bondholders want payment, it could mean many having to first change their jurisdiction to avoid breaching the court's ruling. Write-off But Alejo Costa, chief strategist at Argentine investment bank Puente, said he did not expect many creditors to do so. The government is at least signalling that ""they're doing what they can to make the payment,"" he said. Argentina is in a race against time to make a $200m interest payment due on 30 September. It needs an intermediary bank outside the US court's jurisdiction in which it can deposit the money. The South American country defaulted in 2001 following an economic crisis, and has been in a legal battle with bondholders led by hedge funds NML and Aurelius Capital Management. Under a restructuring of the debt, 92% of bondholders agreed in 2005 and 2010 to write off two-thirds of the bonds' pre-crisis value, providing Argentina with time to rebuild its economy.",Argentina's Congress has passed a bill designed to defy a US court ruling that pushed the country into default in July.
"The firm said it would appeal against Transport for London's (TfL) decision, the latest twist in two years of friction between Uber and the local government. In 2017, Uber also lost its licence, until it won an appeal. It then received a two-month licence in September, which lapsed on Sunday. Users will still be able to use the service while Uber appeals. Uber branded the move as ""extraordinary and wrong"", while London Mayor Sadiq Khan said there had been 14,000 fraudulent trips in London in late 2018 and early 2019, and that ""safety is the paramount concern"". The BBC spoke to three London-based customers and drivers about their experiences with the firm. Rachel Wilkinson, a passenger Uber ""was especially important to me when I broke my leg and relied on it to transport me everywhere. Without Uber I would not have gone out at all and would have been miserable,"" says Rachel Wilkinson, who works in business research. She says she feels for those with mobility problems who might be more permanently reliant on hiring cars, especially when the alternative is pricier private hires and black cabs. ""Uber genuinely was a lifeline,"" she said. Ms Wilkinson says she feels more pressure should be put on TfL to modernise black cabs with the same information available to Uber passengers, and to make them cheaper. ""I do want to make sure I'm driving with someone secure and safe,"" she says, adding that Uber should monitor and assess drivers. The service has allowed her to ditch her car. ""Instead of wasting money on a car I only used at weekends, paying crazy parking and congestion charges and clogging up the roads, Uber allows me to use a car when I need to and not worry about it the rest of the time. ""I'd have thought that given the insane congestion in London, this would a positive thing for the local government too."" Kay, a passenger Kay, who didn't want to give her surname, said her experience with Uber wasn't good. She had used the app for about five years until she had an experience that made her uncomfortable enough to abandon her ride. ""I am sad for the genuine drivers who will lose their jobs,"" she said. ""But Uber itself? No."" She says that after what turned into a disagreement about the route, her driver ignored one of her directions, driving quickly past her turn, and she chose to end the ride. When she complained, Uber offered her £5. She gave the driver a one star review on the app - the worst possible - after which her driver complained about her. The company threatened to suspend her account. There were no apologies for having been made to feel so uncomfortable, she said. ""I was forced, late at night, to abandon the ride... Don't worry about banning my account [Uber]. I won't be using you again anyway. I don't think they take complaints seriously enough,"" she said. An Uber spokeswoman said: ""We take all reports of this nature very seriously and investigate thoroughly. We typically prevent drivers from using the app during investigations and if the allegations prove true, an individual would likely face permanent deactivation. We work closely with the police to assist with any investigation."" Muhammad Ali, a driver ""I knew it was going to happen,"" says Muhammad Ali, who has been driving for Uber for nine months after a 19-year private hire career. He says he feels that TfL care more about drivers of London's black cabs. He says he was shocked about the news of so many unlicensed trips, but believes Uber is a good company to work for. ""I know how this business works,"" he says. ""I think they are driver-friendly."" He says not having to handle cash is a big boon for him as a driver, together with all the other things the Uber software takes care of. This includes the jobs that a human operator would normally be in charge of, such as allocating good routes. ""This is the only company I work for. It is my full-time job. If Uber loses its licence I'll be out of a job,"" he says. That said, he certainly feels that Uber ""should get their house in order sort out all the issues TfL have pointed out"".","On Monday, London's transport authority told taxi hailing firm Uber it would not extend its licence to operate in the capital."
"By Nell MackenzieBusiness reporter But because Harriet shops mainly online, she often finds that what looks good on a computer is disappointing in reality, and she ends up sending most of it back. This week alone, for example, she returned £250 worth of shopping. ""In person, things can be wildly unflattering,"" she says. Harriet is a so-called serial returner, someone who buys items and returns most of them, putting already struggling shops under pressure. People like her are a problem for retailers, particularly in the peak sales season around Black Friday and in the run-up to Christmas. Rebound, a technology firm that helps shops to manage returns, predicts handling the process will cost UK retailers £2.6bn over the next month. Harriet thinks it would be a good idea if retailers banned serial returners because it would encourage her to make more considered decisions. She also worries about the environmental impact of returning so many clothes. ""I feel guilty about it a lot,"" she says. Reports have suggested that it can cost a retailer twice the price of delivery for a product to be returned to the supply chain. When a coat comes back to the warehouse it has to reprocessed, cleaned, repaired, repackaged and made ready for its new owner. In total, it will pass through seven pairs of hands before it is back on sale again. Rebound says online clothing firms, where the fit can be difficult to gauge, are particularly hard hit. Christmas is the worst time of year for High Street retailers because the peak shopping period means the returns process can be delayed. As a result, by the time a product makes it back onto the shelves it might be considered old and have to be sold at a discount. What is Black Friday? The day that shops promote special offers was the name given to the event when it was set up in the US. Traditionally it has always started the day after the American holiday of Thanksgiving, when shops in the US drop their prices for 24 hours. It was designed by shops and other retailers to encourage people to start splashing the cash in the run-up to Christmas. Some say it became known as Black Friday because it was the day that many stores became profitable. Environmental cost Increasingly, retailers are fighting back. According to a recent survey by Barclaycard, one in five has made their returns policy tougher, especially when they can tell that shoppers have used items before returning them. But it's not just the retailers that are suffering. For every item returned, there is an environmental cost to processing the return. Greenpeace is running a campaign to counter the consumerism promoted by holidays such as Black Friday and asking people to turn to home-made gifts this holiday season. ""We're encouraging people to get together to make things instead of buying them, repair stuff instead of throwing it away, and share experiences instead of hoarding more gadgets, toys and clothes that will soon turn to waste,"" says Greenpeace UK's head of climate, Rosie Rogers. Black Friday boycotters And not all retailers are taking part in Black Friday. Supermarket chain Asda, which was one of the first retailers to start Black Friday promotions in the UK, has said it will not take part because its year-round deals are good enough. An Asda spokesperson said: ""We don't just want to offer our customers great deals for one day of the year, which is why we keep our prices low every day."" Smaller retailers are also resisting. Yorkshire businesswoman Debbie Gillespie, who makes bespoke wedding cakes, is refusing to take part because she believes she offers good value to her customers all year round. She has built up the baking business that she runs from her kitchen in Huddersfield over the past five years. ""Why should the customers I have, who want to pay the right amount of money, be disadvantaged by a quick deal? I don't think it is fair on them,"" she says. When she says that when she shops herself, she would rather pay the proper price for something, especially if it is offered by a local business. ""I base my business on honesty and integrity. Dishing out Black Friday deals doesn't sit right with me.""","Harriet Houghton loves shopping for clothes. There is an excitement, she says, when she discovers something fresh that she feels good in."
"It will also close up to 15 supermarkets and 40 convenience stores. The closures are part of a plan to reduce costs by £500m over five years, it said. However Sainsbury's also plans to open around 120 new grocery outlets, mostly convenience stores. The supermarket did not say where the closures would be, but said all Argos staff would be relocated. The plans were announced as Sainsbury's warned investors profits had dipped over the last six months. It blamed bad weather and higher marketing costs for the forecast £50m drop on the period last year. Sainsbury's has been under pressure to show that its business is on track after the collapse of its plan to merge with Asda. Overhauling its large store estate is part of the new plan. It was clear when Sainsbury's bought Argos in 2016 that hundreds of Argos stores would be closed and relocated into Sainsbury's stores. This integration is now well underway. There are now some 290 Argos stores inside a Sainsbury's shop - half of these are relocations. Sainsbury's is keen to point out that ultimately, it'll end up with as many as 100 more shops overall, including a net loss of around five supermarkets. There's no detail today on where the openings and closures could be, nor how many roles will be affected, only that it hoped to boost operating profits by £20m a year through the changes. Sainsbury's is now on a mission to cut costs, some £500m, over the next five years. It's got a tricky balancing act ahead as it tries to cut prices to fend off the discounters and improve its profitability. The supermarket will also cease new mortgage sales as part of a plan to make its financial services division more profitable. Earlier this month, larger rival Tesco sold its entire mortgage portfolio to Halifax, exiting a very competitive market. Low interest rates have made mortgages less profitable for lenders. These moves add weight to the view that offering banking services is becoming a lower priority for the supermarkets, the BBC's personal finance reporter, Kevin Peachey said. ""The big grocery stores were often talked of being the main challengers to the established High Street banks, given customers' brand loyalty and an existing ""branch"" network,"" he said. Value brands Sainsbury's reported sales for the three months to 21 September for stores open at least a year and excluding fuel dropped 0.2%. Clothing and food sales rose, while household goods sales dropped 2%. A fall in its pension deficit means it can reduce its contributions by £50m a year. ""We have focused on reducing prices on every day food and grocery products and expanding our range of value brands, which have been very popular with customers,"" said Chief Executive Mike Coupe. ""At the same time, we are investing significantly in our supermarkets."" Fewer items on promotion and fewer new video game and toy releases hurt sales at Argos, he said, while Sainsbury's Tu brand of clothing performed well. 'Few tweaks' Sainsbury's has been under pressure to come up with a ""plan B"" after its failed attempt to buy Asda earlier this year. It had argued the tie-up was necessary to cut costs and improve its buying power so it could reduce prices to counter the rise of the discounters. Mr Coupe told investors that Sainsbury's could thrive on its own and the reorganisation represented a continuation of his existing strategy with a ""few tweaks"" along the way. ""We're more competitive than we've ever been,"" Mr Coupe said. ""We are confident in our ability to sustainably fund investment in the customer offer."" Sainsbury's is hoping to generate an extra £20m a year in operating profit with the overhaul of its store estate. New convenience stores will be more targeted to what shoppers want, it said. For instance, in London and other city centre locations, outlets will have more ""food-to-go"". It also wants to open around ten larger convenience stores, containing Argos services, in more suburban locations. Sainsbury's has been cutting prices on some daily essentials as well as launching new budget brands , like J James meat, fish and poultry, as they try to match the success of Asda and Tesco's new own-brand ranges.",Sainsbury's is shutting another 60 to 70 Argos shops and moving them inside its supermarkets as part of a reorganisation.
"By Dharshini DavidGlobal trade correspondent But as the clock strikes midnight, it'll also mark the end of the Brexit transition period. Trading relationships that have been in place for years will go up in smoke. Civil servants are racing against the clock to replace these relationships with something even more dazzling and befitting of modern ""Global Britain"". This week trade negotiators will pursue simultaneous talks with three key UK partners - the United States, Japan and European Union (EU). If they fail, businesses and households could pay a high - and very unwelcome - price. What is the UK trying to do? It's been called ""cherry-picking"" by Brussels. But the UK government would see its negotiations there as trying to replace its existing relationship with the EU with one that suits its needs better, while trying to avoid the imposition of tariffs where there are currently none. With the US, it's designing an arrangement from scratch. And in the case of Japan, it's simply replicating a deal that that country already has with the EU - with a few added extras, such as agreements on digital trade. What are the sticking points? Trade deals aim to increase the choice of what's available from other countries - and lower prices. But that has to be balanced by protecting the needs of businesses at home. And this is the tricky bit. While the UK has managed to largely replicate the EU's deal with Japan, the issue of cheese, such as Stilton, has caused a stink. Britain wants better access for its cheese farmers; Japan isn't keen. Is this really worth the strife, given that Japan only buys about £2m worth of British cheese? Well, it's not about the current picture, but the potential for growth. Ditto the US and its chickens. America has made no secret of the fact that it wants its farmers to have a bigger presence on British plates. That's currently up for discussion, and may cause ructions. But what isn't being negotiated is a lowering of standards to American levels - such as the conditions in which chicken can be raised, the reason they're rinsed in chlorine. That responsibility falls to the UK Food Standards Agency. And hard to swallow in Brussels has been the UK's demand for the right to catch more fish in surrounding waters. Fishing makes up less than 0.2% of the UK economy - but, again, it's about the potential gains. And it's about keeping voters happy: trade deals are as political as they are economic. So even talks over small-fry matters mean trade deals take years to hammer out. What are the chances? Ambitions that a deal with Japan, Britain's first major trophy in the Brexit era, could be sewn up by the end of July were dashed. And that's with a partner that accounts for just 2% of British exports. We're edging closer to the finish line, but it doesn't bode well for talks elsewhere. Meanwhile, hopes for a deal with the US, which buys almost a fifth of British exports, ahead of the November election have faded. Officials are now quietly pinning their hopes on an agreement by next spring. As for the EU, the continued impasse where there was once an aim of a deal by October has seen the chances of a no (trade) deal rise sharply. What if there's no deal? If there is no agreement by the end of the year, those countries' imports will face the same charges and rules as those from any other nation with which the UK doesn't have a deal. They'll have the new UK Global Tariff imposed on them. Crucially, that would mean that over half of good imports, by value, from the EU would face extra charges, compared with none at present. The biggest rises would be in the price of cars, and foods such as lamb and beef, where tariffs are being retained to protect British producers. The British Retail Consortium has warned of price hikes on staples from olive oil to cucumbers. Under a previous no-deal plan, the Office for Budget Responsibility reckoned the total cost of tariffs could mount into the billions - and that's with fewer tariffs than now envisaged. Those costs would be borne by businesses and households, squeezing budgets and the ability to create jobs, when the economy least needs it. And that's before taking into account the cost of planning for businesses and potential for delays at the border.","Coronavirus permitting, there'll be fireworks and parties to mark the arrival of 2021."
"By Szu Ping ChanBusiness reporter, BBC News Andrew Bailey said it was important that policymakers acted ""quickly and strongly"", as the Bank announced a further £150bn of support. Tighter lockdown rules, including new restrictions in England, are expected to lead to a slower, bumpier recovery. Policymakers also kept interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.1%. While the economy is expected to avoid another recession, the Bank believes unemployment will rise sharply as government support schemes wind down. The Bank expects the economy to shrink by 2% in the final three months of 2020, before bouncing back at the start of 2021, assuming current restrictions loosen. It does not expect the UK economy to get back to its pre-virus size until the following year. Mr Bailey said: ""We are here to do everything we can to support the people of this country - and we'll do it and will do it quickly."" How has the pandemic hit the UK economy? The Covid-19 pandemic triggered the sharpest economic contraction on record earlier this year as nationwide restrictions were brought in to try to contain the virus. Mr Bailey said the UK had not seen a similar disruption to economic activity in peacetime. ""Even then, these numbers are unprecedented in terms of the scale"", he added. Shoppers helped the economy to bounce back over the summer, and the Bank said retail sales remained strong. Some people had started their Christmas shopping early, while others were buying furniture and household goods to adapt to working from home. However, it said the hospitality, leisure, and tourism sectors had ""suffered from lockdown rules"", and many diners had stopped going to restaurants after the end of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Fresh restrictions across the UK are expected to drag on growth. The Bank expects the economy to shrink by 11% in 2020. The UK is not predicted to sink into another technical recession - defined as two straight quarters of economic decline. However, policymakers now see a deeper downturn and slower recovery than forecast in August. What about the jobs market? Hundreds of thousands of people have already lost their jobs amid the pandemic, despite various support packages, including an extended furlough scheme. Redundancies have climbed to their highest level since 2009 in recent months. The Bank expects unemployment to peak at 7.75% in the middle of next year, from 4.5% currently. This would be the highest rate since 2013. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced that the furlough scheme - under which employees receive 80% of their wages for hours not worked - will now continue until March next year. How does the Bank inject money into the economy? The Bank of England is in charge of the UK's money supply - how much money is in circulation in the economy. That means it can create new money electronically and the Bank spends most of this money buying government bonds through a process known as quantitative easing (QE). QE is sometimes described as ""printing money"" but in fact no new physical bank notes are created. Government bonds are a type of investment where you lend money to the government. In return, it promises to pay back a certain sum of money in the future, as well as interest in the meantime. Buying billions of pounds' worth of bonds pushes the price up: when demand for anything increases, the price usually goes up too. What about Brexit? The Bank said Brexit remained a major source of uncertainty for businesses, as negotiations between the UK and EU on a new trade deal continue. A survey by the Bank showed many large businesses were prepared for new trading rules. However, it said even a smooth transition to a Canada-style deal with no tariffs on goods would knock a whole percentage point off growth in the first three months of 2021. It said some shipments were likely to be ""turned back at the border"" for not having the right paperwork, weighing on export activity for the first six months of the year. What are analysts saying? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the Bank's economic forecasts looked optimistic. ""The MPC's forecasts have been updated for the new lockdown plans, but assume that the Covid hit to the economy gradually dissipates and that there is an immediate move to a free trade agreement with the EU in January; the risks to the outlook are skewed to the downside,"" he said. The Bank is currently exploring if it can reduce interest rates below the current level of 0.1%. It wrote to lenders in October to ask them how they would cope with negative rates. Commercial banks have until 12 November to respond. Karen Ward, chief markets strategist at JP Morgan, said pushing interest rates into negative territory was the ""direction of travel"" for many central banks. However, she expects High Street banks to shield savers from being charged. ""It tends to be large corporates that really face those negative interest rates,"" she said. Are we heading for another recession? While the Bank of England now expects the economy to contract in the fourth quarter of the year it was careful to say that, because this was just one quarter where the economy shrinks rather than two in a row, it didn't meet the rule of thumb for using the word ""recession"", where it shrinks for six months. So no double dip. But before you say ""Oh that's all right then,"" wait. The projection was that the economy would grow by 4% in the last three months of the year. Now it's expected to shrink by 2%. That's a 6% downgrade - almost as much as the peak-to-trough hit in the financial crisis. Over 2020 it will have shrunk by 11% - and won't get back to pre-Covid levels on the Bank's projections until 2022. There's no official definition of the term ""depression"" and Andrew Bailey resists the term for its 1930s connotations. Informally though it's seen as a deep and prolonged recession where the economy shrinks by more than 10% - or lasts more than three years. On the former but not the latter criterion, our current economic predicament is indeed that bad.","The governor of the Bank of England has vowed to do ""everything we can"" to support the economy amid a resurgence of Covid-19 cases."
"By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News, Frankfurt motor show The entire line-up of 12 Toyota models, including six of its Lexus premium brand, are cars with hybrid engines. Toyota's message, says the head of its European operations, Didier Leroy, is that the fuel engine/electric motor combination has come of age. ""This is a tipping point for the technology,"" says the Frenchman, the first non-Japanese to lead the European arm. ""It is now recognised as the key technology needed to achieve the very ambitious emissions targets set by the European Commission."" Increasingly, it seems, consumers agree. Last year Toyota sold about 110,000 hybrid cars in Europe, taking about 65% of that segment of the market. This year, it expects to take close to 75%. It means that about 20% of Toyota's sales in Europe are hybrids. ""Even though our competitors are also introducing hybrid cars in their line-up, our market share is still growing,"" Mr Leroy says. ""I think the consumer understands that the technology has got better. And so has the driving experience."" 'Profitable' It is almost 14 years since Toyota's Prius, the first mass-produced hybrid car, entered the market - to mixed reviews. Toyota is now on its third generation of hybrid technology, but still there is a lot of sniping in the industry that the products do not turn a profit. ""It is simply not true,"" says Mr Leroy. ""The cars are competitively priced and we are making money on sales. We are profitable."" The commitment to the technology remains as strong as ever. Toyota has launched a plug-in hybrid - to recharge a battery - which Mr Leroy claims is out-selling its nearest competitor by two-to-one. He foresees a time when some countries, mindful of congestion and emissions problems, will allow only electric-powered vehicles within their city walls. Mr Leroy says: ""Currently, the technology only allows for short journeys, so they are good for city journeys. But these are things on which we continue to work and develop for future generations of hybrid."" The next game-changer, he says, will be mixing hybrid technology with fuel cells, and Toyota expects to bring such a car to market in 2015. ""This technology can be close to the ultimate eco-car,"" Mr Leroy says. ""And, step-by-step, it will be a very promising technology for the future."" One big problem is a lack of roadside infrastructure that allows car owners to re-charge or stock up on the hydrogen needed for fuel cells. It's a chicken-and-egg problem: what comes first, the car or the infrastructure? For Mr Leroy, the answer is to convince customers about the technology - and offer that technology at an affordable price. Then the infrastructure will follow consumer demand. Divided opinion Toyota's latest tranche of R&D investment on hybrid technology, about $7bn (£4.4bn), will see it through until the first quarter of 2014. The spending comes at a time when opinion is divided over when Europe's economic recovery will take hold. Mr Leroy is more upbeat than many of his peers, who believe the six-year slump in Europe's car sales may not be reversed until 2015. Toyota's own research is reporting that unemployment has stabilised and that business and consumer confidence has risen over the last three months. This chimes with a lot of other economic data, but significantly, perhaps, Toyota does not expect a zig-zag recovery. ""The upward curve will continue to rise. The second half of the year will be quite stable, and from 2014 the market will start to grow."" Just don't expect a return to the sort of record-breaking car sales level of 2007 any time soon. ""It will take, maybe, five, seven, ten years to get back there,"" he says. Multi-million pound investment But expectations of better times ahead have given Toyota the confidence to invest. In June, the company announced a £155m investment in a touring sports version of its Auris model, to be built at its Burnaston plant, near Derby, to compete alongside the VW Golf and Vauxhall Astra. Mr Leroy, a manufacturing man by background, ran a Toyota plant in France before being appointed president and chief executive of the Europe division in April 2011. His job was to re-organise and cut capacity in response to plummeting consumer confidence and the eurozone crisis. Although manufacturing capacity was reduced, the Burnaston plant benefitted after a decision to locate all Auris production - which had been shared with a factory in Turkey - at the UK site. It means that the factory, along with Toyota's engine plant on Deeside, employ about 3,800 people. ""We don't need to increase our capacity in Europe. But I'm pleased to say, also, that we don't need to reduce it,"" Mr Leroy said. Any increase in sales will be met, at least in the short-to-medium term, by increasing shift patterns at Toyota's UK, Turkey, and French plants. ""Many of our competitors still have problems with overcapacity, but we don't have such problems,"" he says. 'Never forget' Toyota's re-organisation in Europe came after the company suffered a big knock to its reputation. Recalls of hundreds of thousands of cars, the result of malfunctions and safety scares, dented the Japanese company's once unquestionable reputation for quality control. In 2009, Toyota announced the biggest ever single recall by a manufacturer, of 3.8 million vehicles. And in June this year, 242,000 Prius and Lexus hybrid cars were called back because of 90 complaints about the brake pedal. Yet, last month Toyota raised its sales and profit forecasts for the year ending March 2014, another indication perhaps that the company has weathered the storm. The recalls were a bruising period, and one Mr Leroy says Toyota ""will never forget"". And although many of the problems were quality control issues, he believes that there was also a lot of ""rumour spraying around without any foundation"". Either, way Mr Leroy says, Toyota continues to ""recall a lot of cars, because we have a zero tolerance"" when consumers register complaints. The problems need investigating. That, he says, is the way to keep loyal customers loyal.","Green is a big theme at this year's Frankfurt motor show, but no carmaker has gone as far as Toyota in putting its eco credentials on display."
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent Some of the economies at the centre of the crisis continued to contract, but more slowly than before. That was true of Greece, Italy and Spain. Even that, in the context of the eurozone crisis must be considered good news. Most surprising was Portugal's return to growth after more than two years of declining economic activity. But it's hard to disagree (for once, some might say) with the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn. Welcoming the figures, he added a note of caution: ""self-congratulatory statements suggesting the crisis is over are not for today,"" he said. He's dead right. Nobody is forecasting a really robust recovery in the near future. It will take more rapid growth than we have seen in these new figures to make much of an impact on the eurozone's two big problems, unemployment and stressed government finances. Progress There certainly have been some signs of progress in these areas. The eurozone unemployment rate hasn't increased since March - and yes, that is progress. I have lost count of the number times I have had to deal with eurozone unemployment hitting a new record. The jobless rate in Spain has edged down in the most recent figures. But it remains excruciatingly high; over 25% in Spain and Greece, and in double figures for all the crisis countries plus France. Governments have also made progress in reducing their borrowing needs. But it has been by the painful method of cutting spending and raising taxes. What they could really do with is a bit of the pain-free deficit reduction that comes with strong growth generating more tax revenue. That is not on the immediate horizon. The focus is on economic reforms intended to encourage growth, more flexibility in the labour market and promoting competition, for example. But such measures are contentious, politically difficult and in any case take time to implement and yield results. Big bazooka So there is a long way to go for the eurozone. But as long as there isn't another downturn, the end of the recession is an important milestone. It marks another stage on the rather slow process of rehab that really began a little over a year ago when the President of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, made his ""whatever it takes"" speech. The key remark was: ""Within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough."" Later, he spelled that out, saying the ECB would buy the bonds or debts of struggling governments in some specific circumstances. In fact the ECB has not bought a single bond or spent a single euro under the proposal he set out. Nonetheless, the mere fact that the ECB was ready to act - that it had revealed what commentators called a ""big bazooka"" - did restore a degree of calm to financial markets. That, in turn, has underpinned the stabilisation that appears to be slowly taking place in the wider economy. So now for some really robust economic growth in the eurozone! Well, not just yet, perhaps.","It's not much, and it is unevenly distributed, but it is growth. Germany, as expected, has led the eurozone out of recession. France also managed moderate growth."
"The comments about Amanda Staveley were made in phone calls in 2008 when the bank was trying to raise billions of pounds from Gulf states. Ms Staveley was involved in talks with investors to help broker the deal. But ex-Barclays boss Roger Jenkins told the court she was a ""complete unknown"" when it came to such transactions. In a written witness statement, Mr Jenkins said that at the time Ms Staveley had received ""some publicity"" for her role in brokering an investment in Manchester City. But he told Mr Justice Waksman that, as far as he knew, she had ""no qualifications in finance"". The judge has heard that Mr Jenkins referred to Ms Staveley as ""the tart"" during an October 2008 telephone call with fellow Barclays boss Richard Boath. Mr Boath referred to her as ""that dolly bird"" during the call. Ms Staveley, 47, has made complaints about the behaviour of Barclays bosses when negotiating investment deals during the crisis 12 years ago. She says Barclays agreed to provide an unsecured £2bn loan to Qatari investors, but the loan was ""concealed"" from the financial markets, shareholders and PCP Capital Partners, a private equity firm she runs. PCP is suing the bank for up to £1.6bn in damages. Ms Staveley, currently working on a deal which could see a Saudi consortium take control of Newcastle United football club, says PCP introduced Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour to Barclays and he ""subscribed"" to invest £3.25bn. She says PCP is owed money for the work it did. Barclays disputes PCP's claim and says it is made ""of sand"". Mr Jenkins said: ""Ms Staveley, as leader of PCP, had received some publicity by 2008 for her role in brokering the Abu Dhabi investment in a major English football club, but she was a complete unknown in terms of large, complex, public market transactions of the kind we were undertaking."" 'Self-publicity' At the time, he was Barclays executive chairman of Middle East business. ""So far as I knew at the time, PCP did not employ experienced analysts familiar with the finance sector and Ms Staveley herself had no qualifications in finance."" He said he knew little about Ms Staveley's background in 2008. ""I was aware that she had once owned a restaurant by a racecourse and that was how she had made connections with Middle Eastern individuals,"" he said. ""I knew that she had played a role in Sheikh Mansour's purchase of Manchester City."" He added: ""My assumption and hope at the time was that Barclays would deal with Sheikh Mansour directly as the principal, not through advisers. ""I did not at any point understand PCP to be acting as a principal, or as a prospective investor in its own right."" Mr Jenkins said his impression was that Ms Staveley was seeking to use her involvement in the deal to ""generate publicity for herself"". He told how Ms Staveley arrived for one early-morning meeting accompanied by a photographer. Lawyers representing PCP referred to the telephone conversation between Mr Boath and Ms Staveley early in the trial. Detail of the words used emerged on Thursday, when Mr Jenkins began giving evidence and a transcript of the call was made available to journalists. Mr Boath said, during the October 2008 call: ""Yes. Now, that dolly bird that represents - is it - what's her name?"", the transcript showed. Mr Jenkins replied: ""Amanda Staveley."" Later in the call, Mr Jenkins said: ""Well I am - you know, I'm going to call the tart; I was going to call the tart."" Mr Boath asked: ""Who's the tart?"" Mr Jenkins replied: ""Amanda."" In February, Mr Jenkins, Mr Boath, and another former Barclays boss, Thomas Kalaris, were cleared of fraud over a £4bn investment deal with Qatar at the height of the banking crisis. The Serious Fraud Office had alleged that lucrative terms given to Qatar were hidden from the market and other investors through bogus advisory service agreements. But the three men were acquitted by jurors following a five-month trial at the Old Bailey.","A financier embroiled in a £1.6bn court battle with Barclays was referred to as a ""tart"" and ""that dolly bird"" by bank executives, a court has heard."
"The new roles come on top of the 1,000 posts it added during lockdown as demand from shoppers increased. The extra jobs announced today will be spread across the new shops and 15 stores that are being enlarged. The Co-op said its research had found that 70% of adults have relied on their local convenience store for food and other goods in recent months The retailer also said that it had expanded its online shop. The Co-op currently employs 55,000 workers across the UK and has 2,600 stores. The new stores will open in areas such as Wrexham, London, Poole, Leeds and Guildford. Meanwhile up to 12 new Co-op franchise stores are also set to launch this year, including at Oxford Brookes University and Stirling University, with more university locations planned for 2021. ""We continually look for new locations, sites which are definitively convenient in their community,"" said David Roberts, managing director of Co-op Property. He said more than 100 of the Co-op's outlets would receive major makeovers as part of a £130m investment programme. The chief executive of the Association of Convenience Stores, James Lowman, said: ""This commitment to investing in stores in the coming months is testament to the importance of the convenience sector."" The grocery sector has seen a surge in demand during the pandemic, and the big supermarket chains have also been creating jobs. Last month, Tesco said it would create 16,000 permanent jobs after the lockdown led to ""exceptional growth"" in its online business. 'Financial fallout' While the grocery sector has done well, other parts of the economy have been hit hard by the pandemic. It was announced on Friday that 540 workers at Nationwide Accident Repair Services have lost their jobs after the struggling business was sold to RunMyCar in a pre-packaged administration. As part of the deal 30 of Nationwide's sites have been shut. Founded in 1993 in Witney, Oxfordshire, the business operated 115 garages across the country, as well as a mobile fleet of repair vans, servicing the accident repair market for UK insurers. But the company suffered a substantial decline in business during lockdown as millions of motorists stayed off the road. ""As with many other businesses, the group had to weather major financial fallout due to the economic impact of Covid-19, which meant that trading volumes were significantly reduced,"" said Rob Lewis, joint administrator at PwC. ""Against that backdrop, the sale announced today reflects a significant positive outcome for the business, and we are especially pleased to have safeguarded 2,350 roles including apprentices, mechanics and technicians. ""Sadly we have had to make 540 staff redundant.""","Grocery chain the Co-op is opening 50 new stores and creating 1,000 new jobs this year."
"By Bill WilsonBusiness reporter, BBC News The uncertainty comes after the firm was reported to be facing pressure from its biggest external investor, Japanese firm SoftBank, to drop its flotation plans amid concerns about its plunging valuation. The company was valued at $47bn (£38bn) last year, but reports have suggested it is now considering a price tag of less than $20bn. Other high-profile and heavily loss-making companies - such as ride-hailing apps Lyft and Uber and messaging app Slack - have struggled to maintain their initial valuations. The firms were part of a pack of much-touted ""unicorns"" - privately held start-ups valued at more than $1bn. The trio launched their Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) this year in a blaze of glory. But while Slack is still trading near to the price it listed on the stock market, both Uber and Lyft are trading much lower. Backed by venture capital firms and allowed to grow while enduring big losses, the firms have faced more scepticism since listing their shares. So is the flotation bubble about to burst? There are worries over prospects for global economic growth, given factors such as the US-China trade war and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. Some argue that in tighter economic circumstances, companies and consumers are likely to cut back their spending on things such as cab rides and workplace apps - not to mention spending on desk space hire. Tech analyst Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research, said: ""They are obviously very different businesses, but the connecting thread is that they are losing money, burning cash and rely on sustaining very high growth rates over time. ""If there is anything that changed in the mood music, it is that multiple segments of the market are increasingly pricing in a recession. ""At the same time, these new IPOs [Initial Public Offerings] are reliant on continuous sales growth just to turn a first profit."" He said Uber and Lyft were used on average some 30 times a year per person, which was not enough for the firms to make a profit. ""These companies are losing money right now,"" Mr Kramer said. ""Getting to scale - meaning 50 to 100 rides per active user per year - requires a far larger share of what are discretionary consumer purchases. Uber and Lyft need customers to use them more and more, but in a tighter economy, this growth may be harder to come by."" He added that the question that markets were now asking was: are these companies ""recession-proof""? What is WeWork? Led by the charismatic Adam Neumann, WeWork offers serviced office space, often to small, start-up ventures. Critics say it must fulfil long-term contracts with landlords while using short-term contracts with its customers, making it vulnerable to downturns, should its custom dry up. The company has lost more than $4bn since 2016, burning through capital even as its revenues have doubled each year. WeWork said in its IPO filing that it could slow its expansion dramatically if it needed to become profitable. In 2018, WeWork lost $1.9bn on revenue of $1.8bn. It lost an additional $904m on revenues of $1.54bn in the first half of 2019. So far, it has not made a profit, but since starting in 2010 it has grown rapidly, spreading to 528 locations in 111 cities in 29 countries. 'Longer path to profitability' Turning to Slack, he said the workplace communication app was in the unenviable position of competing with an offer from Microsoft. ""If you are buying Microsoft software for your business, you are already getting Teams built in,"" Mr Kramer said. Microsoft Teams is a unified communications platform combining workplace chat, video meetings, file storage and application integration. Teams may not yet have all the features that Slack offers, but ""buying Slack becomes an optional extra purchase"", he added. Slack is also appealing more to ""start-ups that want to use new tools"". Mr Kramer concluded: ""If you look at the forecasts for all these early-stage growth companies that IPO, they assume continuous growth, but the market is now pricing in a lower likelihood of uninterrupted growth, and therefore a much longer path to profitability than hopeful backers originally envisaged.""",One of the most hotly anticipated stock market listings of the year - the flotation of office property rental firm WeWork - is now in doubt.
"By Justin HarperBBC News He wants to rival the likes of Grab, GoJek and WeChat with an all-in-one app for food delivery, shopping, payments, entertainment and travel. As the airline’s boss, he has been looking at new ways to generate income while his planes were grounded. AirAsia has struggled during the pandemic and cut 30% of its staff. In an interview with the BBC, Mr Fernandes said he has spent his time during the travel slump improving the AirAsia app and the company's payments platform BigPay. ""The downturn was a blessing in disguise in some ways as it allowed us to focus more on it. Running an airline takes up a lot of our time but we have been given the opportunity and time to focus on our digital business."" AirAsia already has a ""rich database"" of over 60 million users as its starting point. The AirAsia app, which also offers users a messaging service, has set its sights on super apps like Singapore-based Grab, Indonesia’s GoJek and China’s Meituan. ""AirAsia has always been a digital company. We were one of the first airlines to sell online. It’s in our bloodstream,"" added Mr Fernandes, who is also a major shareholder of English football club Queen’s Park Rangers (QPR). ""I know a super app sounds like a lofty target but Grab and GoJek also started out small as food or mobility apps. Plus people also questioned me the same way when I said I wanted to start AirAsia."" Mr Fernandes’ airline has now grown to become Asia’s biggest budget carrier. Making music Last year AirAsia launched its own record label called RedRecords in partnership with Universal Music. The aim is to discover stars from South East Asia who will appeal to a Western audience. The first major signing, Thai pop star Jannine Weigel, has already built up millions of followers across social media. ""Boy have we got something special with the record label. The Koreans have shown how Asian music can appeal to a global audience with K-pop and there is huge potential for South East Asia."" ""This also helps us engage with a younger audience and gives lots of content for our app.""","AirAsia’s founder Tony Fernandes is building what he hopes will be the region’s next ""super app"" as he deals with the coronavirus travel downturn."
"The figures - released by the payments operator BACS - show the net loss in accounts between April and June. However TSB, which has 5.2 million customers, said thousands of people had also opened accounts during the period. As many as 1.9 million people were left unable to access their own money in April, after the bank tried to introduce a new computer system. The crisis resulted in the resignation of the bank's chief executive and an enquiry by the regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is still considering whether to fine the bank, after it was judged to have misled Parliament over the issue. The number of customers switching their accounts elsewhere is likely to be exacerbated by further computer problems experienced by the TSB in September. ""As expected, customers voted with their feet on the back of the TSB IT fiasco, with the bank losing a net 16,641 customers to rivals,"" said Andrew Hagger of Moneycomms.co.uk. ""The only real surprise is that this figure wasn't much higher - although the discontent could rumble on and we may yet see a similar outflow of accounts when the next quarterly figures are released next January."" TSB said some customers had still opened accounts, despite the difficulties. ""During the three months in question we actually saw more than 20,000 customers either open a new bank account at one of our branches or switch their account to us,"" it said. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was the next biggest loser in the quarter, with 12,362 customers switching to accounts elsewhere. The biggest gainers were the Nationwide Building Society, which attracted an extra 34,577 customers, and HSBC which gained 25,605.","More than 16,000 customers have deserted the TSB in the wake of an IT meltdown earlier this year."
"Sterling dipped 1.1% to $1.2242 and €1.1004 respectively. The currency could fall further, according to analysts at ING Group, as traders appear to have been betting on a last-minute deal being reached. Many business lobby groups have asked that no-deal be withdrawn as an option to keep investment flowing into the UK. The pound dropped after ""the events over the weekend, where the current stance of the new government became clear"", said Petr Krpata, a currency strategist at ING Group. Michael Gove, who is in charge of planning for no-deal, has said the UK government is currently ""working on the assumption"" of that very outcome. He said his team still aimed to come to an agreement with Brussels, but writing in the Sunday Times, he added: ""No deal is now a very real prospect."" Mr Krpata says ING Group's assumption is that an early election will take place and that the pound will sink as low as €1.05 and $1.18. The last low for sterling was $1.2049, reached in January 2017. The record low was $1.0545 from March 1985, just before G7 powers acted to constrain a particularly strong US currency. Sterling suffered today, at the worst possible time for holidaymakers, as the probability of leaving the EU without a deal rises. It dropped to its lowest level versus the dollar since the Article 50 process began in March 2017, just about staying above $1.22. It reached a two-year low versus the euro of below €1.10. The weakness is now broad based - there was also a fall against the Yen. It is now a trend, down between 6% and 9% against the major currencies since the beginning of May. This will mean rising consumer prices. The rough rule of thumb would see this 6% trade-weighted fall add about 1 percentage point to inflation, enough to complicate the decisions of the Bank of England over interest rates. In theory, a lower pound helps some exporters and, for example, the domestic UK tourism industry. But so much of our manufacturing base needs to import components in order to make those exports, that this effect has not been strong in the years following the significant pound devaluation after the 2016 Brexit vote. Currencies fluctuate, of course, but the path for the pound has been firmly down, as markets start to calculate that the odds on No Deal are far closer to evens than, as the PM has suggested, ""a million to one"". The pound's performance against the dollar During a visit to Scotland, Mr Johnson said the existing withdrawal agreement negotiated with European leaders was ""dead"" and had ""got to go"". EU member nations have said renegotiating the deal is not an option. Today's prices mean even fewer euros and dollars at the bureau de change for holidaymakers. At the Post Office, £1 buys €1.0817 or $1.2041, according to its website. The pound's performance against the euro Separately, UK government debt prices gained as traders bet on a higher chance that interest rates will be cut. The country's 10-year bonds, considered the benchmark, are changing hands for a price that yields as low as 0.627%, the lowest in nearly three years. This implies that the cost of borrowing for the government has fallen.",The pound sank to a 28-month low against the dollar as Boris Johnson's government toughened its rhetoric on Brexit.
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service Economics correspondent The big political parties didn't make much of it during the campaign. Both the Conservatives and Labour are broadly in favour, though the Greens are very critical. TTIP was however addressed in the manifestos. War on Want (who oppose the plans) have compiled the parties' positions on the issue. Outside the political arena there are some very strong opinions. Many business voices are enthusiastic, but there is also very vocal opposition. What is TTIP and what is it for? The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, or it will be if the negotiations are completed. The aim is to boost the economies of the EU and the US by removing or reducing barriers to trade and foreign investment. President Obama said, when the talks were launched, that TTIP would promote ""new growth and jobs on both sides of the Atlantic"". Critics reject that claim - more of that below. A study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research (CEPR) - done for the European Commission - estimated the potential gains for the EU as up to €119bn (£85bn; $134bn) a year and €95bn (£68bn; $107bn) for the US. For a family of four that comes to €545 per year in the EU and €655 in the US. Wages would be higher, by 0.5% in the EU and just under 0.4% in the US. The CEPR has done a more specific estimate of the benefits for the UK, which suggested gains in annual national income of up to £10bn. How would TTIP work? By eliminating almost all tariffs (taxes applied only to imported goods) on trade between the US and the EU. But the tariffs imposed by the US and EU are already relatively low for the most part, although there are some exceptions in, for example, farm produce and textiles. The bigger gains envisaged would come from reducing what are called non-tariff barriers. In particular the two sides think they can promote trade through what they call regulatory co-operation. This is about costs to business. Complying with regulations involves a cost. A firm that wants to export may incur further costs meeting the regulatory requirements of the country it's selling into. The European Commission says that rules in Europe and the US often achieve the same level of consumer safety and product quality, but differ in their technical details and their methods for ensuring that firms have met the rules. One of the aims of TTIP is to reduce this burden on business. One option is recognising one another's standards. That's under consideration for many types of goods. They also plan to co-operate more closely on new regulation. That basic idea is that by reducing the cost of exporting, TTIP would encourage more of it. What about investment? The idea here is to encourage transatlantic foreign investment. The European Commission says an agreement in this area would prohibit discrimination against foreign investors, expropriation, denying access to the courts and arbitrary and abusive treatment. If a foreign investor felt these rules had been violated, they would have access to a system known as investor state dispute settlement, or ISDS. This is a system of tribunals that could award compensation to the investor if they had lost money as a result of a breach of the rules in the agreement. Why is TTIP controversial? Regulation Much of the concern is about the regulatory aspect: that it would lead to lower standards of consumer and environmental protection and safety at work. A group of 170 European civil society organisations said in a statement that regulatory co-operation as envisaged in TTIP would result in ""downward harmonisation"". There is also a concern that TTIP could undermine governments' right to regulate in the public interest. They say it will also give business groups a disproportionate influence over new regulation, and therefore, they argue, it is undemocratic. Economic benefits Others question the analysis behind claims that TTIP will be economically beneficial. Jeronim Capaldo of Tufts University in the US says the European Commission's study makes unrealistic assumptions about how easy it would be for workers who lose their jobs to find new employment. He argues that Europe would actually be worse off, in terms of economic activity, wages and government revenue. Investment There are also questions about whether a TTIP agreement would really stimulate more investment. A London School of Economics Study for the British Department of Business, Innovation, and Skills concluded that an investment chapter would be ""highly unlikely to encourage investment above and beyond what would otherwise take place"". ISDS has generated a lot of heated opposition. One complaint is that it will discourage governments from regulating in the public interest. Olivier Hoedeman of Corporate Europe Observatory, a Brussels-based campaign group, said it would act as a ""chill factor"" on governments who would fear that business regulation might lead to protracted legal challenges and bills for compensation. ISDS arrangements are common in international investment agreements. But research by the United Nations Commission on Trade and Development suggests investors have made more use of the tribunal system in recent years. Perhaps the most high-profile - some would say notorious - examples were the actions taken by the tobacco company Philip Morris against Uruguay and Australia over new rules on the packaging of their products, rules intended to make them less attractive to consumers. Neither case has been completed. There is a particular concern expressed by British campaigners about the possible impact of ISDS on the National Health Service. There is, they argue, a danger that if a government wants to reverse any arrangements to contract services out to private suppliers, it might risk being sued under ISDS. European and British officials insist that TTIP's ISDS provisions won't have that effect, but many campaigners don't believe it. What is the timetable? A summit of European leaders in December called for a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2015, though the European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström has said that is probably unrealistic. That will be challenging, given the technical complexity and the vigorous opposition. It would then have to be approved by the European Parliament and European Trade Ministers. The Ministers usually vote on trade by what is called qualified majority though unanimity might be required - that is both a legal question and a matter of political judgement. Depending on the legal nature of the final agreement it might also need to be approved by all the EU member states, and Commissioner Malmström has said that is likely to be necessary. So there is plenty of scope for delays. And it will need approval by the US Congress. President Obama is struggling unsuccessfully so far - to get Congress to give him what is called Trade Promotion Authority which would make US ratification less difficult. What happened to the idea of global trade liberalisation and how would agreements such as TTIP fit? There is a global trade negotiation under way in the World Trade Organization (WTO). It's known as the Doha Round, because that is where it was launched - back in 2001. It has been very slow. At the end of 2013 the WTO members finally agreed a part of that agenda. It's called the Trade Facilitation Agreement and it's about the mechanics of international commerce - customs procedures, for example. The really hard stuff is still not agreed. Trade Facilitation is sometimes called the Doha Round's ""low-hanging fruit"", yet it still took 12 years to pick. Frustration with the slow pace has led many countries to pursue bilateral and regional deals. The WTO's Director General Roberto Azevedo has said: ""These initiatives are important for the multilateral (global) trading system — but they do not substitute it."" The other really big example is the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), which involves 11 countries, including the US and Japan (but not China). TPP is also still under negotiation.","There's one big issue for the new UK government that stayed below the radar during the election campaign - trade negotiations between the European Union and the United States, known as TTIP, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership."
"The US bank's European chief executive, Richard Gnodde, said it would begin the process before the UK leaves the European Union. He indicated the bank would bolster its presence in other European cities over the next 18 months. Other London banks have already said they would move jobs after Brexit. It was confirmed on Monday that Prime Minister Theresa May will officially notify the EU next Wednesday that the UK is leaving. If all goes according to the two-year negotiations allowed for in the official timetable, Brexit should happen in March 2019. Financial hub But Mr Gnodde told CNBC that Goldman Sachs would not wait until the end of the Brexit talks to ""execute on its contingency plans"". He said the bank would both ""hire people inside of Europe itself"" and have ""some movement"" from the UK. ""This is in the hundreds of people as opposed to anything greater than that,"" he added. The company, which is in the process of building a new office in London, would not comment on whether that would result in a net reduction of workers in the UK. In February, Goldman confirmed it was closing a London hedge fund office and moving staff to the US, but denied it had anything to do with Brexit. Another senior executive at the bank said last week that London would remain a significant financial hub after Brexit. The City of London has a ""long history"" as a financial centre, which will be difficult for European cities like Frankfurt to challenge, Andrew Wilson, the regional boss of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told the BBC. Earlier this year, HSBC and UBS confirmed that some staff would definitely have to move abroad when the UK left the EU.","Goldman Sachs will move jobs away from London and bulk up its European presence by ""hundreds of people"", a senior executive has said."
"John Cridland, the director general of the CBI, said that a deadline should be set for the end of legal claims for compensation. PPI was widely mis-sold to applicants for loans, credit cards or mortgages. Generally, these customers have six years from the moment they were mis-sold the insurance to make a claim. Or customers can still make a claim during the three years after they became aware that they might have a case, even if the sale was more than six years ago. However, writing in The Times newspaper, Mr Cridland said that the level of publicity about PPI mis-selling meant that everyone who might have been mis-sold PPI would now be aware they could make a claim. ""I firmly believe we now need to draw a line under PPI,"" he wrote. ""Such a move could be reinforced by the Financial Services Authority declaring that the point at which consumer awareness of PPI mis-selling is widely known has now legally been reached."" Millions of claims PPI was designed to cover loan repayments if the policyholder became ill, had an accident or lost their job. However, the policies were mis-sold on a huge scale to those who did not want or need it, or would have been unable to make a claim. Financial institutions have set aside close to £13bn to cover the cost of PPI mis-selling. Estimates have suggested the bill could reach £15bn. More than 2.5 million people have already received payouts, at an average of £2,750 each. The banks have started the process of writing to people who they think may have been mis-sold PPI, inviting them to make a claim. The level of claims has risen as the result of claims management companies, which have used television advertisements and text messages to drum up business. This has led to some accusations of bogus or pointless claims, although these businesses - which take a cut of any payout - say that they are simply providing a service for those who were previously unaware or nervous about making claims. ""PPI mis-selling is seen as a huge scandal that should never have happened and it is right that consumers are able to get swift and proper redress,"" Mr Cridland wrote. ""But banks are sending out tens of thousands of compensation payments and cheques and there is a real sense that the ball is now firmly in the court of ambulance-chasing claims management companies."" Meanwhile, the British Bankers Association, which represents the major UK banks, said: ""We are working with our members on a number of aspects of PPI complaints. ""The ongoing work focuses on three issues as a priority: addressing backlogs, making sure that customers can be confident that the offers they receive are right, and highlighting that there is no need for them to engage a claims management company."" Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of consumer group Which?, said: ""Time-limits already apply to PPI complaints. Rather than trying to stop people claiming back what is rightly theirs, the banks should be doing everything possible to make it easier for consumers to claim back their money, without any hassle.""",A business leader has called for a line to be drawn under the response to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI).
"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent Vice-chancellor Sir David Eastwood said the campus in the Gulf would show the university's ""global mission"". The first phase of Birmingham's new outpost in the United Arab Emirates will open in the autumn. But most of the undergraduate and graduate courses, to be taught in English, will run from autumn 2018. While Dubai's shopping malls have collections of big-brand international shops, the Gulf state also has an expanding line-up of high-status international universities. Birmingham's new base will be in Dubai International Academic City, a purpose-built campus opened a decade ago, which already houses 26 universities from nine countries, with 25,000 students. Academic exports Students will be able to get a full University of Birmingham degree without having to leave the Gulf. Dubai already has branches of UK universities such as Exeter, Bradford, London Business School and Heriot-Watt. These rub shoulders alongside universities from Australia, the United States, Ireland, India and Russia. Not far away, in Abu Dhabi, there are branches of the Sorbonne from France and New York University from the US. More stories from the BBC's Global education series looking at education from an international perspective, and how to get in touch. You can join the debate at the BBC's Family & Education News Facebook page. Elsewhere in the Gulf, there are campuses of University College London and Carnegie Mellon in Qatar. The University of Aberdeen has also recently opened a campus in Qatar. There had been speculation that such bricks-and-mortar academic exports would have been overtaken by the rise in online technology. Competition for students With the emergence of the so-called ""Moocs"" - massive online open courses - there were suggestions that international students might prefer to study online, rather than need to have a campus built on their doorstep. But universities have continued to expand overseas - taking their brands to international students. There are now more than 240 international branch campuses around the world, according to figures compiled by the Cross-Border Education Research Team at the State University of New York. Not all have been a success, with more than 40 closures - but more than another 20 are in the pipeline to be opened. Universities from the United States, the UK and France have been the biggest builders of overseas branches - accounting for more than half of the overall total. These have clustered around the most lucrative and expanding markets - with China, the Gulf states, Malaysia and Singapore among the most common host countries. Teaching in English Such international campuses allow Western universities to tap into expanding markets. They can offer students a degree from a prestigious Western university, without the expense or visa barriers of studying abroad. And for universities in the UK, facing tough competition for students at home and financial uncertainties, it provides another potential source of tuition fees. Nottingham, Liverpool, Southampton, Newcastle, Bolton, Middlesex and Reading all have international outposts. This internationalisation is also raising competition within Europe, with an increasing number of courses being taught in English, with the aim of attracting more overseas students. Universities in France have been making efforts to promote English-language courses to international students, including from the UK. Within English-speaking countries there have also been fluctuating trends in the international student market. The US and the UK have traditionally been the biggest players, but this month Canadian universities have claimed applications from overseas students are rising to ""unprecedented"" levels. The reason for the sudden preference for Canada, they say, is the rise of ""isolationism"" in the US and Europe.",The University of Birmingham's plan to open a campus in Dubai is the latest example of universities expanding with international branches.
"The billionaire, who is chairman of both companies, said he would be surprised if the deal did not go through next month. The takeover will expand the electric car maker's clean energy business. But some shareholders oppose the deal, arguing it is a conflict to combine two of Mr Musk's firms. ""I'm pretty optimistic about where the vote's going,"" Mr Musk, who owns large stakes in both businesses, told analysts on Tuesday. ""The early votes so far have been overwhelmingly in favour... I would find it quite strange if that didn't turn out to be the case."" Mr Musk was speaking after the car maker released further details about the deal, including estimates that SolarCity could add $1bn of extra revenue to Tesla next year. 'A few naysayers' Together, the two firms will move towards ""accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy"", Tesla said, by generating and storing clean energy and providing transport that uses it. Tesla also sought to address concerns about SolarCity's financial standing by revealing that the solar panel installer had raised about $1bn in funds in the last four months. Mr Musk said there had been ""quite a few naysayers"", including big hedge funds, about Tesla's expansion into the energy business. But he questioned how good they had been at predicting the outcome for Tesla in the past. ""If they have a batting average of zero, you should really question whether their future predictions are going to be better,"" he said. Investors will vote on the deal on 17 November.","Tesla Motors founder Elon Musk is ""pretty optimistic"" shareholders will approve a $2.6bn (£2.1bn) deal to buy solar panel company SolarCity."
"By Jim ReedReporter, Victoria Derbyshire programme One in five of the commercials broadcast across 25 matches were for betting firms, rising to more than one in three in some games. The government is considering whether new restrictions are needed, with a report expected as early as this week. The industry says the adverts have ""limited impact"" on gambling rates. Under an agreement with the industry commercials can only be shown after the 21:00 watershed except in sporting events. The research looked at 25 games involving British teams broadcast this season, from the build-up through to the post-match chat on BT Sport, Sky Sports and ITV. 'Concerned' In these matches there was a total of 1,324 commercials and sponsorship indents, and of these, 272 were for gambling. For some games the rate of gambling adverts was even higher - in Everton's match against Apollon Limassol on 28 September on BT Sport, 40% of the adverts and sponsorship indents were for betting, with 18 adverts for five firms. In Sky Sports' coverage of Scotland's 3-0 defeat by Slovakia on 11 October, 37% of the commercials were betting-related, with 19 gambling adverts for eight different firms. Meanwhile, the one women's football match which was broadcast contained no adverts for gambling. In 2007, the then Labour government relaxed the rules around gambling advertising, letting high street and online betting firms show TV commercials for the first time. In 2016, betting firms spent £150m a year on TV adverts. A single advert for Premiership football is thought to cost about £35,000. Matt Zarb-Cousin, from the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said: ""We are concerned about the effects of children and young people being exposed to gambling advertising due to the pre-watershed exemption for live sporting events. The government has an opportunity to address this in the forthcoming review."" 'Gambling normalised' Earlier this year, Australia banned all gambling adverts in live sport before the watershed, while Belgium has recently done the same. Last month, the Local Government Association called for greater restrictions. It said it was concerned the volume of gambling advertising was undermining the government's aim for socially responsible growth in the sector. It highlighted that the adverts in live matches were screened to millions of viewers including children, while half of Premier League and Championship football teams were sponsored by betting companies. A recent study by Goldsmiths University found more than 250 separate gaming adverts on screen during the BBC's Match of the Day programme. These were mostly on shirts, hoardings and post-match interviews. Greater restrictions on advertising are expected in a major review of the sector, which could be released by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport this week or early next month. The government said it ""expects the gambling sector to protect players"", but added ""clearly more work is needed"". Clive Hawkswood, chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, which represents the online gambling industry, said the evidence on the effect of the adverts was ""far from conclusive"". ""The reality is, gambling is normalised in this society and if you look at why, it was probably the introduction of the National Lottery, it changed the perception,"" he said. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News Channel.","Some 95% of TV advertising breaks during live UK football matches feature at least one gambling advert, the Victoria Derbyshire show has found."
"The service is available to Three customers travelling to the Republic of Ireland, Australia, Italy, Austria, Hong Kong, Sweden and Denmark. European authorities have been clamping down on roaming charges. But Three is the first network to abolish them altogether, albeit in selected countries, where it has sister networks. Three says customers on a pay monthly contract would be able to use their allowances of free minutes, texts and data with no extra charges for being abroad. However, those on unlimited plans will be subject to some restrictions. In a press release, Thomas Malleschitz, marketing director at Three, said: ""By abolishing expensive roaming charges in select countries, we are allowing our customers to get even more value from their minutes, texts and data abroad by removing the fear associated with staying in touch while travelling."" Analysts say that other operators of mobile phone networks are likely to follow Three's lead, particularly those who already have a presence in other countries. Matthew Howett, a senior analyst at consultancy firm Ovum, says the deal from Three is also interesting because it applies to nations outside the European Union, where there has been pressure from authorities to lower roaming charges. ""Reducing roaming charges outside of that bloc will welcomed by many, since prices have remained stubbornly high in some countries,"" he said.",Three has announced that it has abolished international roaming charges in seven countries.
"Those countries are the US, Japan, Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. But will pushing through such a pact prove too gargantuan a task? And will China continue to be left out of talks? Four experts give their views on what's at stake for the US, Japan, China and Vietnam. US: 'Strategically significant' Joshua Meltzer, Brookings Institution: US President Barack Obama's trip to Asia this week and his meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Park Geun-hye present an important opportunity to refocus attention on the TPP. It is the most significant trade agreement the US is negotiating, representing 40% of world trade and a destination for over 60% of US exports. As importantly, the TPP is strategically significant as it is the economic dimension of a broader US rebalancing towards Asia. The two largest economies involved in the TPP are the US and Japan. Their intensive bilateral discussions have been aimed at liberalising each other's markets for a range of goods in sensitive areas such as agricultural products and cars. Successfully resolving US-Japan market access issues will place pressure on other TPP members to liberalise their own sensitive sectors, creating momentum in the negotiations towards a high-standard agreement. Progress in US-Japan discussions will significantly improve prospects for concluding the TPP. Mr Obama should use his trip to Tokyo this week as an opportunity to push Mr Abe to liberalise faster. More countries may also potentially join the trade grouping. South Korea is not a TPP member, but Ms Park has indicated the country's desire to join. China's views of the TPP will also be discussed in Tokyo and Seoul. The US has made it clear that China is welcome to join the TPP if it can demonstrate a willingness to live up to the rules being negotiated. This reflects the strategic dimension of the TPP - to be a template for economic growth in the region. Japan: 'Compelling national interest' Takuji Okubo, Japan Macro Advisors: Over the last 12 months, most of the sticking points that Japan had against joining the TPP seem to have been resolved. On the five so-called ""sacred"" agricultural products, the US has already agreed to let Japan keep its tariff on rice, wheat and sugar in exchange for Japan taking non-tariff measures to increase the imported quantities. On beef, Japan seems to have gotten away by agreeing to lower tariffs by 9% in the distant future. Negotiations are still ongoing about the tax restrictions on pork. The domestic political climate also favours Mr Abe. The rival opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, promoted the TPP while it was in power. Among major opposition parties, the Japanese Communist Party is the only one who has been consistently against the TPP. According to a poll by Japan's public broadcaster NHK, 31% of people supported joining the TPP, while 14% were against it and 45% said they were indifferent. Is the TPP beneficial for Japan in the first place? From an economic point of view, there is no room for doubt. Japan's government estimates the economy will expand by 0.66% as a result of the elimination of tariffs. When we include non-tariff deregulation, the economic benefit will be much larger, probably to the tune of 2% to GDP. Beyond economic pluses and minuses, the TPP brings forth a much broader and compelling national interest as far as Japan is concerned. With geo-political pressure from China intensifying, it is also in Japan's interest to solidify its alliance with the US and other Asia-Pacific nations. While I believe any political arrangement to isolate China would be neither wise nor feasible, a strong economic alliance among Asian countries would be a good bargaining chip to convince China towards a friendlier and mutually beneficial relationship with Japan. Japan should and is ready to embrace the TPP. China: 'Reputational benefits' Brian Jackson, IHS Global Insight: China stands to gain considerably by joining the TPP. Most immediately, it would add China to a growing coalition of countries co-operating to increase trade and investment across dimensions that have been frustrated in traditional multilateral forums. Moreover, joining negotiations with high ambitions provides China greater scope for defining its own form of participation than abstaining and joining later, after an agreement is reached by earlier members. An omission as notable as China's weakens the total benefits of any agreement reached. In addition to helping the TPP build momentum, Beijing throwing its weight behind the TPP would also help frame China as a meaningful advocate for reform and positive change. Over the past few years economic growth in China has slowed by about one-quarter as debt ballooned. China's new leadership has correctly laid out an ambitious reform agenda to spur the economic restructuring necessary to secure another decade or more of growth, although implementing those lofty ideals is not guaranteed. The TPP's focus on services, investment and government procurement, among other trade issues, would dovetail nicely into China's current efforts to reform its economy. This includes managing local government debt while growing social services offered to a larger share of rural-urban migrants. China joining the TPP would offer immediate reputational benefits, and plant the seeds for boosted economic activity once an agreement is reached. Given China's ambitions, abstaining from the TPP would not only be a conspicuous omission, it could also sow the seeds for slower investment and services trade activity in the future, given stronger policy incentives elsewhere. Vietnam: 'A clear winner' Jack Sheehan, DFDL Legal and Tax Services: Vietnam is set to gain the most from the TPP due to the potential for a greater share of the apparel and footwear market, particularly in the US and Japan. In 2012, Vietnam exported almost $7bn (£4.2bn) worth of apparel to the US, which accounted for 34% of US apparel imports. Vietnam also exported $2.4bn worth of footwear. The TPP will allow Vietnam to export apparel to the US at a 0% tariff rate, which will make Vietnamese exports even more competitive. Vietnam enjoys several competitive advantages, such as low labour costs, and benefits from being closer in proximity to major textile exporters China and South Korea. It also enjoys strong government support such as subsidies on financing, energy and trade promotion. However, a key concern for Vietnam is the Rules of Origin (ROO) on apparel. Vietnam is pushing for the more liberal ""cut and sew"" ROO, which only requires that cutting and sewing of finished products originate in TPP countries. This is unlike most US free trade agreements which adopt a ""yarn-forward rule"", which states that yarns used to make the textile or apparel must have been produced in the TPP country. The yarn-forward rule benefits the US yarn and fabric industry because it exports yarn and fabrics to TPP countries like Vietnam. The industry accounts for two million jobs in the US. However, the ""yarn-forward rule"" does not benefit Vietnam since most of its yarns and fabrics are sourced from China and South Korea, which are non-TPP countries. There are other challenges that would have an impact on Vietnam. TPP rules relating to state-owned enterprises may affect the government's dominance in the garment industry. According to the US Congressional Research Service, Vinatex, which is owned by the Vietnam government, reportedly accounts for 40% of apparel production and 60% of textile production. It remains an open question as to whether the TPP rules will prompt greater privatisation of the sector.","It is poised to be the world's biggest ever free trade deal and possibly its most ambitious. A dozen countries are negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which if successful, will account for two-fifths of world trade."
"It was one of a raft of measures announced by Chancellor George Osborne in the Autumn Statement. He said it reflected ""society's debt of gratitude to our servicemen and women"". It follows a previous move, in October 2012, which allocated some £35m in fines imposed on the banking industry to armed forces charities. ""To reflect our society's debt of gratitude to our servicemen and women, and their families, I want to make a further £100m of Libor fines available to our brilliant military charities and extend support to those who care for the work of our police, fire and ambulance services,"" said Mr Osborne. ""The terrible events in Glasgow this weekend and the work they're doing right now to cope with the adverse weather remind us how much we owe them."" The Libor scandal surfaced last June, when Barclays was fined £290m for attempting to fix the inter-bank interest rate. Since then, Swiss bank UBS, Rabobank and Royal Bank of Scotland have been fined hundreds of millions of pounds. ""This latest announcement by the chancellor is fantastic news for all armed forces charities,"" said Jane Easton, secretary general of the RAF Association. ""The RAF Association is delighted to have been awarded around £30,000 in an earlier tranche of funding, which we are using to train all of our welfare volunteers to an accredited standard."" She said it was vital to ensure that all the association's volunteers had the correct skills set ""to meet the needs of those who require our support"", and that all volunteers should be trained by 2015. A spokesman from SSAFA, which supports military personnel and their families, said: ""SSAFA welcomes the announcement that further money has been made available for military charities as a result of Libor fines levied on banks."" ""This funding will enable military charities such as SSAFA to make preparations for the long-term care of our Armed Forces and their families, wherever and however it is needed."" But Sam Bowman, research director at free-market economic think tank the Adam Smith Institute, said: ""It's bizarre to give Libor fines to charities. ""It simply makes no sense. What's the connection between Libor and military charities?""",The government has said £100m of money gathered from UK banks in Libor fines will go to military charities and the work of ambulance and police services.
"Sirius Minerals blamed ""market conditions"", including Brexit and lack of government support for the decision. It will now undergo a six-month review of four different options for a new financing plan to resume the project. The company's share price halved in reaction to the news. Sirius had already paused the bond issue last month, blaming ""market conditions"". The project is set to be the world's largest mine for polyhalite, a naturally occurring fertiliser which is used in agriculture. The mine is due to open in 2021 and create more than 1,000 jobs. The plans include a 23-mile (37km) tunnel to transport minerals to a processing plant near the former Redcar steelworks. Different parts of the work will be slowed up to maintain cash flow while the strategic review takes place. Announcing the changes, Sirius managing director Chris Fraser said: ""This is the most prudent decision to give the company the time necessary to restructure its plans to move the project forward. ""The process will incorporate feedback from prospective credit providers around the risks associated with construction and will include seeking a major strategic partner for the project."" The company said it had asked the government for support but its request had been turned down. Sirius added that it believed that ""this commitment would have enabled the company's financing to be delivered as planned"". The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""When examining any request for financing, we have to assess the potential of a project against the need to protect taxpayers' money."" He added: ""We have made and continue to make very significant investment in the Northern Powerhouse project."" The MP for Redcar, Labour's Anna Turley, said it was ""devastating news"". She added on Twitter: ""That the government are refusing to step in and secure this enormous project is an absolute disgrace. ""This government owes everyone involved an apology. It's not too late to change their minds and step in to save this huge project and the jobs and livelihoods that rely on it."" Middlesbrough's MP, Labour's Andy McDonald, tweeted: ""Sirius is critical to Teesside's future and if government stands aside as they did with the Redcar Blast Furnace they will never be forgiven."" Robert Goodwill, the Conservative MP for Scarborough and Whitby, said it would be ""unprecedented"" for the government to step in. ""I hope they will be successful in finding a partner, I think that is the best way forward,"" he said. ""The government looked at it and said it wasn't the sort of thing it could do, it is a commercial project and if it is a viable project then other companies will back it."" 'Not game over' Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen, said there was still hope the problems could be overcome. ""I'm in daily contact with Chris Fraser and remain confident that the truly transformational benefits this project can deliver for our region can and will be delivered,"" he said. Russ Mould, from investment platform AJ Bell, said: ""This is terrible news for a very large number of retail investors who had put their faith in the company. ""Many of these shareholders live close to the mine and invested as a show of support in a project that had the potential to greatly improve the local economy."" He added: ""Although the share price has taken a beating on today's news, it isn't game over for Sirius and its shareholders. The miner has a few options to try and salvage the project.""",The future of a huge potash mine in North Yorkshire has been thrown into doubt after the company behind the project cancelled plans to raise $500m (£403m) through a bond sale.
"The figures for the Walmart-owned supermarket, filed at Companies House, confirm a torrid spell for Asda as it faced stiff competition in the grocery sector. Like-for-like sales were down 5.7% compared with the previous year. Pre-tax profits dropped almost 19% to £791.7m at the Leeds-based company. ""The grocery market has continued to experience low growth throughout the year and competition in the sector has remained intense. Our sales performance, relative to the market, was behind our expectations,"" the company said. Changes Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - the so-called big four UK supermarkets - also face competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl. Asda suffered more than most and, unlike others, has struggled to fight back. In May, it reported decreasing sales in the first quarter of 2017 - the 11th consecutive quarter of falls - as it continued to lose ground to its rivals. However, Asda added that despite the disappointing results, there had been an improvement following ""strategic changes"" under new boss Sean Clarke. Mr Clarke, who replaced previous chief executive Andy Clarke a year ago, has slashed the prices of everyday items as he attempts to arrest falling sales. The chain reported a 2.8% fall in like-for-like sales in its first quarter of this year, a moderate improvement on the previous period, which saw sales fall 2.9%. 'Focus on price' Analysts have said that a major turnaround is required at Asda. ""Sainsbury's and Tesco have always had more opportunity for differentiation from the discounters, but Asda has chosen to focus on price rather than range and in-store experience, which has clearly been the wrong strategy,"" said Tom Berry, retail analyst at GlobalData. ""Asda has been flailing without direction for too long, and a comprehensive plan is needed if it is to survive in the highly competitive UK grocery market."" Phil Dorrell, of consultancy Retail Remedy, is a previous marketing chief at Asda. He said that it was a difficult market for Asda and it ""had a lot of catching up to do"". ""It is not changing significantly or fast enough to pull around the results. It did not get its proposition right,"" he said.",Sales falls and lower profits at supermarket Asda in 2016 have been revealed in detail in newly-filed accounts.
"By Jamie RobertsonBusiness reporter, BBC News Its ethical policy states that any artwork using Lego products should not ""contain any political, religious, racist, obscene or defaming statements"". However, the Danish company was widely attacked by commentators and accused of not wishing to annoy the Chinese government, which Ai regularly criticises. Lego has now relented and on Wednesday announced that it had changed its policy. It will no longer ask customers what they want to use the bricks for, but requests that they make clear that the company does not support or endorse their projects, if exhibited in public. But should a business be picky about whom it sells to? 'Strict restrictions' The problem is that selling as much as you can to anyone and everyone can have unintended consequences. Some customers can turn into your competitors. LVMH, which owns luxury brands from Christian Dior clothing to Dom Perignon champagne, has had its Chinese business undermined by bulk sales ferried into the country by so-called ""daigou"" agents. Taxes and currency differences make luxury goods far more expensive in China. Some analysts estimated that by mid-2015, Chinese prices were 60% higher than those in Europe. The daigou agents, many of them students making extra cash to finance their overseas studies, buy up luxury products in bulk in Europe and Hong Kong and sell them on at home. It is sometimes known as parallel trading. So LVMH started to watch its customers more closely. Speaking on a conference call earlier last year, Jean-Jacques Guiony, chief financial officer at LVMH, said: ""We've placed strict retail restrictions for the amount of products that people can buy. ""But, when you see someone in a store, you don't know whether they are buying handbags for themselves or to sell them on to the market in China. We are trying to make sure we are not competing with our own products in the China market, but our actions are not entirely bullet-proof."" Grey market Other companies have found it easier to try to equalise prices. The fashion house Chanel raised its European prices by 20% and cut them in China, directly competing with the daigou agents and successfully eroding their profit margins. This kind of grey market happens everywhere. A supermarket might halve the price of a box of chocolates in a sale and sell them all to a single customer, only to see them turn up in the corner store down the road, undercutting their recommended retail price, a fortnight later. That's not illegal, but there are ways to stop it - by restricting sales. The British Retail Consortium's external affairs adviser, Bryan Johnston, says: ""In the end, it is up to the individual store. It is in the gift of the retailer to decide on how much they want to sell to any one customer."" Many supermarkets imposed restrictions two years ago when the scandal over contaminated baby milk in China prompted overseas Chinese to buy up formula and import it into China. However, these were more to do with trying to stop a run on the product at home than trying to stop any kind of parallel trading abroad. More can be more, or less But for some retailers more is, well, more. Marks and Spencer spokeswoman Clare Wilkes says: ""A few years ago, a woman came into one of our stores and bought up the every piece of cashmere we had. We had no objection to that - at all."" But the luxury goods industry on the whole is very choosey about whom it sells to. The most famous example is Burberry, which by 2006, when Angela Ahrendts became chief executive, was growing just 2% a year in a booming luxury market. It was selling everything from kilts to dog cover-ups and leashes - to everyone. Ms Ahrendts wrote later in the Harvard Business Review: ""In luxury, ubiquity will kill you - it means you're not really luxury anymore. And we were becoming ubiquitous."" Ms Ahrendts completely restructured the company, drastically reducing its product range, centralising production and design, making it more expensive and then, restricting the customer base. She added: ""We began to shift our marketing efforts from targeting everyone, everywhere, to focusing on the luxury customers of the future - millennials. We believed that these customers were being ignored by our competitors."" The restrictions it imposed were financial. The kilt and dog-leash buyers were simply priced out of the market. Many of the core Burberry products, such as the signature trench coat, now cost more than $1,000 (£700). Brand consultant Rebecca Battman says: ""There are unintended consequences of your brand becoming popular - the more widely seen it becomes, the more it will diminish the power of the brand among the people you really want to appeal to."" Ms Ahrendts' strategy worked. Within five years, Burberry's revenues and operating income had doubled and 2014-15 revenues rose 11%. Less had become more.","When Lego originally decided not to sell the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei bricks with which to make a political statement, it really thought it was doing the right thing."
"The supermarket chain will switch from offering plastic ""bags for life"" to a paper alternative. Morrisons says the move will make it the first UK supermarket to stop using plastic carrier bags completely. In recent years, all supermarkets have tried to cut plastics use. Some of Morrisons' High Street competitors have initiatives of their own. Waitrose is currently trialling the removal of its 10p bags for life from a number of its stores with a view to rolling it out more widely. For its part, Sainsbury's says its bags for life cost 20p to encourage customers to re-use them and are made from 100% recycled plastic. Asda defended its continued use of plastic bags for life, saying they were a ""sustainable alternative to single-use carrier bags... particularly given the concerns around CO2 emissions related to the paper-bag production process"". 'Significant milestone' Morrisons said the removal of the plastic bags for life would begin in Scotland this month, followed by England and Wales over the course of the next 12 months. It follows a successful trial in eight of its stores last year. Morrisons has almost 500 supermarkets nationwide. Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said: ""We have been listening hard to our customers over the past year and we know that they are passionate about doing their bit to keep plastics out of the environment. ""Removing all of the plastic bags from our supermarkets is a significant milestone in our sustainability programme."" Almost 100 million plastic bags will be removed in total, saving 3,200 tonnes of plastic a year, according to Morrisons. Morrisons says the reusable paper bags will cost 30p each and are recyclable, water and tear resistant. It says the bags can hold up to 16kg - or 13 bottles of wine, the same as a plastic bag for life. Paper bags will be sold alongside string, jute, cotton and reusable woven bags, which are priced between 75p and £2.50. Morrisons has also removed all plastic bags from its fruit and vegetable areas in store, offering brown paper bag alternatives instead. Plastic bags and packaging are still used on meat and fish counters but customers can bring their own containers to take items home. Online deliveries fulfilled by its partner Ocado, which account for 25% of all Morrisons' online orders, will continue to be delivered in recyclable plastic carrier bags. Single-use 5p carrier bags were removed from Morrisons in 2018.",Morrisons has said it will remove all plastic carrier bags from its stores over the next year.
"By Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter Home Retail Group said that it began discussions with Wesfarmers in September, with a firm offer resulting in November. Wesfarmers owns Australia's biggest home improvement retailer, Bunnings, as well as the Coles supermarket chain. Although the company has completed due diligence, talks were continuing. Home Retail said that Wesfarmers was a ""substantial and strong group with an ambitious plan"" to develop Homebase and that the £340m cash price offered good value for shareholders. John Walden, chief executive of Home Retail, said the sale would allow the company to focus on Argos with an improved financial position, which represented ""an even greater opportunity for building long-term shareholder value"". Earlier this month, Sainsbury's said that Home Retail had rejected its bid to buy the Argos chain. On Tuesday, the supermarket issued a 22-page presentation outlining why a takeover of the catalogue and online retailer was ""strategically compelling"". Sainsbury's could close between 150 and 200 Argos stores and move them to a nearby supermarket, the BBC understands. Many store leases are due to expire in the next couple of years and Sainsbury's has excess space in many of its stores. Under the deal being proposed, Wesfarmers would buy the entire Homebase business, including all stores and distribution centres. Product brands such as Habitat would not be included, but licensed for use by Homebase for one year. Shares in Home Retail, which updates the market on its Christmas trading on Thursday, closed up 4.1% at 147.7p before the Homebase announcement. The stock has jumped by more than 50% since Home Retail's rejection of the Sainsbury's bid was revealed.","The owner of Homebase has said it is in advanced talks to sell the DIY chain to an Australian retailer, Wesfarmers, for £340m."
"In a call with business leaders on Tuesday evening, Mr Hammond sought to reassure the business community that a ""no-deal"" Brexit could be avoided. According to the CBI, he outlined how the 29 March date might be postponed. Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, told the BBC the government would not be delaying Brexit. ""We are clear we won't be delaying Article 50. We won't be revoking it,"" she said. John Allan, president of the CBI, said the chancellor appeared more relaxed about the possibility of delaying Brexit. Philip Hammond was joined by the business secretary Greg Clark and Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, for the conference call with business representatives, which came shortly after the government's EU withdrawal deal was rejected by the House of Commons 432 to 202. The CBI, the UK's biggest business lobby group, has warned a ""no-deal"" Brexit is a threat to jobs and growth. Mr Allan said it ""wasn't absolutely crystal clear"" that the government could avoid that scenario, but he understood, following the call, that there would be moves in Parliament next week which would allow the UK's exit date from the EU to be put back ""if it became clear we were heading towards that"". A delay to implementation of Article 50 would avoid the UK leaving the EU without a negotiated deal. The CBI chief said he was encouraged by government moves to build a cross-party consensus for a new approach to Brexit. Despite fears that the pound would plummet if the government suffered a heavy defeat in Parliament, sterling rallied slightly. Shares traded in London broadly flat on Wednesday morning. Some observers have suggested that there is now a stronger consensus amongst MPs wishing to avoid a ""no-deal"" Brexit, making that a less likely outcome. The governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney told Parliament's Treasury Committee the strengthening of the pound reflected the markets' interpretation that ""the process of resolution will be extended... and the prospect of no deal has diminished."" Investment bank Goldman Sachs said Tuesday evening's Parliamentary defeat for the prime minister made it more likely that the UK would pursue a ""softer"" Brexit, retaining closer ties to the EU, or even that Brexit might be overturned. ""We think the prospect of a disorderly 'no-deal' Brexit has faded further,"" Goldman Sachs' European economist Adrian Paul wrote in a note. Goldman Sachs still believes the most likely outcome is that ""a close variant"" of the deal Mrs May has negotiated with Brussels will eventually be passed by the House of Commons. However, Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said the UK was still ""staring down the barrel of no deal"". ""As things stand, UK law says we will leave on 29 March, with or without a withdrawal agreement, and yet MPs are behaving as though they have all the time in the world - how are businesses meant to prepare in this fog of confusion?"" he said.","Chancellor Philip Hammond has raised the possibility of an extension to Article 50, the process by which the UK is due to exit the EU."
"The Insolvency Service said no such payments had been made since the construction firm collapsed on Monday. The announcement comes as work on Carillion's public sector construction sites is paused pending decisions about their future. However, work on most of its private sector service contracts, such as catering and cleaning, will carry on. Carillion's customers want existing services to continue until new suppliers can be found and will provide funding to retain staff for the moment. Several former executives of the firm would have received pay and benefits this year. On Wednesday, Business Secretary Greg Clark met representatives of some banks to seek assurances that they would support small businesses affected by the Carillion collapse. Afterwards, he said UK lenders were ready to give ""tailored support"" and flexibility when it came to repayments. About 30,000 smaller firms which have been working on Carillion projects in the private sector face an uncertain future and are waiting to learn whether they will be able to get hold of money owed to them. HMRC said it will also help affected contractors, offering them more time to pay tax bills and providing workers with cash support through the tax credits system. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hit out at the ""wildly excessive"" bonuses paid to Carillion directors. He also accused the government of negligence, saying it awarded contracts to Carillion even when it became clear the company had problems. Mr Corbyn also called on the government to end the ""costly racket"" of private sector firms running public services. Mrs May said a third of government contracts with Carillion were agreed by the previous Labour administration, adding she wanted to provide ""good quality public services, delivered at best value to the taxpayer"". 'Scandalous' Earlier GMB union boss Tim Roache had said the government's response to the Carillion crisis had been ""inadequate and inept"". He said that his union had called on Mr Clark to set up a task force to help private sector companies and employees affected by Carillion's collapse. He called on other private sector companies to take on affected workers without a change in their terms and conditions - a process that he admitted would not be a short one.

""We'd been chasing them for money, we hadn't been paid since July and when we heard the rumours about a week-and-a-half ago that Carillion were in a lot of trouble, we really pressed. ""Fortunately for ourselves, we did actually get paid the money that was owed to us for the work that she'd done between August and November. ""We've pulled our cleaner out at the moment and we're just still waiting to hear from them what's happening next before we send her back in again. ""It looks like we are going to lose the December invoice money that we've sent them and obviously the first two weeks of January. ""It's been an ongoing battle since we've been in there to get paid and we're not prepared to take the risk while they're in liquidation. ""Until we see something in black and white saying that, 'Yes, you will get paid on these set terms,' then we will consider sending our cleaner back in again."" Carillion went into liquidation on Monday after rescue talks with its lenders and the government failed to reach a deal. The UK's second-biggest construction company ran into trouble after losing money on big contracts and running up debt of about £1.5bn. The company employed 43,000 people worldwide, including 20,000 in the UK, and the government has said staff and contractors working on public sector contracts will continue to be paid.

"By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News She says: ""One board member threw down his pen and said 'this isn't going to work, women aren't interested in sex'. ""Obviously it said a lot more about his sex life than it did about my idea."" This exchange took place back in 1981 when Ann Summers, part of a wider adult entertainment business called Gold Group International (GGI), was just a four-store chain. GGI is still to this day owned by Ms Gold's father, David Gold, who is also the co-owner of West Ham Football Club. Ms Gold had joined the family firm in 1979, aged 19. After doing a number of basic admin jobs, her big idea was to try to transform the Ann Summers brand by setting up a new Tupperware-style party service solely for women, and introducing lingerie that was actually comfortable and flattering to wear. Under Ms Gold's plan, a female Ann Summers representative would visit a woman's house with a range of lingerie and sex toys for the woman and her friends to see and potentially buy. Ms Gold's central thinking was that it would open up a whole new market of women who would have been too embarrassed or unwilling to walk into an Ann Summers store. Despite the reluctance of some members of the GGI board, Ms Gold was given the go-ahead, autonomy and funding. The parties were an immediate hit, and within a year Ms Gold has signed up 500 party organisers. With the party side of the business then continuing to see its turnover grow at more than 20% every year, Ms Gold started to invest the money into building a network of new stores. Again aimed at women, the shops were to be a world removed from the grubby, backstreet sex shops of old. Instead they were to be clean, bright, and located on High Streets. The aim was for them to be socially acceptable. Today Ann Summers has 140 stores across the UK and Republic of Ireland, and an annual turnover of £140m ($215m). Meanwhile Ms Gold, 55, who was formally made Ann Summers' chief executive in 1987, has a personal wealth estimated at more than £500m. She says: ""When I joined Ann Summers its customer profile was only 10% women, today it remains 100% women going to our parties, and 80% women to our stores. ""I always say that I have taken the company from the raincoat brigade to a female institution."" 'Gut feeling' With no business qualifications, or prior experience of running a company, Ms Gold says she had to rely on her ""gut instinct"" when it came to making decisions in her early years. She adds: ""When you are younger you just do things so differently. You'd think, 'I don't know this, I don't know that', but you just get on with it, and I worked really hard. ""We were growing really fast, and of course we had lots of teething problems. ""One mistake was to throw people at problems because we didn't have the money for a strategy, and I wasn't savvy on how to put a proper business plan together. ""Instead it was all my own gut feeling, and having to rely on feedback from my customers, which at the time I thought was a disadvantage, but any business leader will now tell you is an advantage."" Key problems along the way at Ann Summers have included being unable to source sufficient supplies to keep up with demand, which ultimately forced the company to source all its lingerie from China instead of the UK, says Ms Gold. ""The sex toys have always come from Hong Kong, but I used to be proud to say our lingerie was made in Britain,"" she says. ""Unfortunately we ultimately had to switch to China because the suppliers in this country just could not cope. [By contrast] in China they are so set up for huge orders."" The business also had to put up with copycat companies along the way, but Ms Gold says she was able to see them off by focusing on offering both better quality products and customer service. And she has successfully fought against regulatory constraints against the business, such as winning a 2003 court case against the UK government to allow Ann Summers to advertise for staff at job centres. 'Amuses me' Although Ann Summers' bricks and mortar stores were affected by the last recession, with a few closing, sales have since recovered. At the same time, online turnover has continued to rise strongly. Ms Gold says the parties part of the business also remains popular, especially for women over 35, while those aged 18 to 25 are the primary customers of the physical stores. While still a very much hands-on chief executive, in her spare time Ms Gold likes to mentor other female entrepreneurs, and lobby the government to help improve gender equality in business. But how does she respond to any suggestion that she is only successful because of her father giving her the top job at Ann Summers? ""That amuses me,"" says Ms Gold. ""When I'm asked that question I say that if it wasn't for my success at Ann Summers he wouldn't have been able to buy two football clubs - Birmingham City and [then] West Ham. ""I'm glad in my own indirect way to have played a big part in that... but I built up Ann Summers on my own.""","When Jacqueline Gold first proposed making UK lingerie and sex toys chain Ann Summers a lot more female friendly, she was rather taken aback by the reaction of one of the company's all-male directors."
"The union is calling for reassurance from the plant's French owners, PSA Group, that they will continue to invest in the facility. But Unite said the government also needed to provide more certainty. PSA Group has announced 400 job losses in Ellesmere Port due to falling sales. ""We ask that ministers give PSA and other manufacturers a clear signal that government will do all it needs to do to support this crucial sector through the Brexit process,"" said Unite general secretary Len McCluskey. Unite described the job losses as a ""major blow"" and another ""huge loss"" to the economy in the north of the UK, coming just days after BAE Systems announced it was cutting nearly 2,000 jobs, predominantly at sites in Yorkshire and Lancashire. The union said it was seeking high level meetings with the UK government and PSA executives to discuss the future of the Ellesmere Port plant, which makes Vauxhall's Astra models. Announcing the job losses, PSA Group, which owns the Peugeot, Citroen and Opel brands, said that manufacturing costs at Ellesmere were higher than other ""benchmark plants"" in the group. Ellesmere Port will move staff from two production shifts to one in early 2018. Vauxhall employs about 4,500 people in the UK, with about 1,800 at Ellesmere Port. The company also has a factory at Luton, which makes vans. When PSA bought Vauxhall from General Motors earlier this year, UK Prime Minister Theresa May personally sought assurances from the French company's chief executive that investment in the UK plants would be maintained. But last month, Mr Tavares said it was hard to decide upon the group's strategy for Vauxhall given a lack of clarity over the UK's plans to leave the European Union. However, a Vauxhall spokesman said the move from two shifts to one was nothing to do with Brexit uncertainty, but was about maintaining competitiveness in a changing industry. He pointed out that sales of so-called sports utility vehicles (SUVs) have grown rapidly across Europe, while the type of five-door estates and saloons made at Ellesmere Port have fallen.","The government should give ""a clear signal"" that it will support the automotive industry through Brexit to protect jobs at Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port plant, the Unite union says."
"She has run GSK's Consumer Healthcare unit since 2010. But she lacks any previous experience in a chief executive role and has no background in pharmaceuticals. Consequently she will start on a pay package 25% lower than her predecessor Andrew Witty, who retires on Friday. GSK's most recent annual report indicates her basic salary will be about £1m, in contrast with Mr Witty's £1.1m. Her pension and potential for earning through bonuses and long-term performance targets are also lower. ""Taking into account the fact that this is Emma's first chief executive role, reductions have been made to all elements of her remuneration package in comparison to Sir Andrew's,"" the report said. ""Constructive feedback"" about remuneration from shareholders had also played a role, it said. GSK is the fifth largest company traded on the London Stock Exchange and as head of its Consumer Healthcare business Ms Walmsley was responsible for brands such as Sensodyne toothpaste and the malted drink, Horlicks. Before joining GSK she spent 17 years at French cosmetics giant L'Oreal. 'Bias for action' Ms Walmsley originally studied classics and modern languages at Oxford before moving into business, taking up a management and marketing role at L'Oreal, which included several years at its Shanghai office. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said he did not see her lack of scientific background as a disadvantage. ""It's not as if GSK lacks people with a pharma background,"" he said. ""If anything, there's more strength in her having a firmer grip on the consumer business, as that's something that... maybe wouldn't be done as well by someone from the pharma side."" Ms Walmsley has described herself as having a ""bias for action"" and as highly competitive. She also said she had been inspired by other business leaders such as Alibaba founder, Jack Ma, and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. She is married with four children, but has said in the past that she did not see herself primarily as a woman in business but as a business person. She said that she was supported through her maternity absences and was aware of her responsibility to keep supporting young talent as well as acting as a role model to encourage young women ""to stay ambitious, aim high and think big"".

"European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso made the announcement following President Barack Obama's State of the Union address. The US said that ""everything is on the table"" in the talks. A deal would bring down trading barriers between the two biggest economies in the world. EU-US trade is worth around 455bn euros (£393bn; $613bn) a year. ""A future deal between the world's two most important economic powers will be a game-changer, giving a strong boost to our economies on both sides of the Atlantic,"" said Mr Barroso, speaking in Brussels. The EU estimates that a ""comprehensive and ambitious agreement"" will boost annual GDP growth by 0.5%. Mr Obama announced US support for talks as part of his annual address to the US Congress on Tuesday, saying a free-trade deal would ""boost American exports, support American jobs and level the playing field in the growing markets of Asia"". It is not clear how long the talks will take, but similar trade deals have involved years of negotiations, and the BBC's Gavin Hewitt in Brussels says the most optimistic timeframe given by European officials is two years. A US-EU working group was established in 2011 to discuss the prospect of a free-trade agreement. The US trade representative, Ron Kirk, said that even sensitive issues such as agricultural subsidies will be up for discussion. ""For us, everything is on the table, across all sectors, including across the agricultural sector, whether it is GMOs [genetically modified organisms] or other issues,"" Mr Kirk said. ""We should be ambitious and we should deal with all of these issues."" Low tariffs EU Trade Commissioner Karel De Gucht told the BBC that free trade between the US and the EU had been under discussion for several years, and said he hoped talks would begin in the summer. But he admitted that the negotiations would be ""difficult"" and ""complex"", but he warned: ""As the two biggest economies in the world, failure is not an option."" The EU says the deal will focus on bringing down remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade, and standardise technical regulations and certifications. Currently the US and EU impose relatively low tariffs on goods traded between them, but analysts say other barriers are often in place to prevent European companies competing in the US and vice versa. One example is found in the car industry, where the EU and the US employ equally strict - but differing - safety standards, meaning that European car makers must meet both before they can sell cars in the US market, putting them at a disadvantage. Mr De Gucht estimates that such barriers are equivalent to a traditional imports tariff of 10-20%. Rise of China Agriculture is also likely to be a significant bone of contention. The European farming industry is already heavily subsidised through the Common Agricultural Policy, and the European agriculture minister has already expressed reservations about the impact a free-trade deal might have. The US government is also likely to come under pressure from domestic businesses who have in the past called for protectionist measures to prevent the market from being swamped by cheaper Chinese imports. The EU has already said that certain ""sensitive"" sectors will require more negotiation but said no sectors would be excluded from the deal completely. The chief European economist at Barclays, Philippe Gudin, suggested that the emergence of China as an economic power along with other emerging markets has encouraged the US and Europe to unify in order to remain economic leaders. Mr De Gucht denied that they were seeking to combat Chinese growth, saying: ""We are the leading economies and it's important that we remain the leaders, but in a way that allows others to develop."" Steve Davies from the Institute of Economic Affairs, a think tank, said he believed the economic crisis in Europe was a far more important factor. ""It's happening now because there has been seriously depressed growth in the EU, and this will be good news for economic growth,"" he said. ""On the American side, the critical factor is that Obama is now in his second term, so he doesn't have the protectionist pressures from US businesses to worry about.""","The European Union and the US will begin formal talks on a free-trade agreement, paving the way for the biggest trade deal in history."
"The satellite broadcaster said it was engaging with the regulator Ofcom in its assessment of BSkyB's suitability. Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns 39% of BSkyB, has sent an email to staff saying the business will be ""better and stronger"" following the phone-hacking scandal. BSkyB also announced a rise in customer numbers of 78,000 to 10.5 million. The company's ""fitness"" to hold a broadcasting licence had been questioned as a result of the phone hacking scandal at News of the World and other newspapers owned by News Corporation. The Liberal Democrats wrote to Ofcom on Tuesday urging it to hasten its review, but the BBC understands that the regulator will not be rushed into a knee-jerk reaction. On Tuesday, the Commons media committee concluded that Mr Murdoch was ""not a fit person"" to run a major international business, although four of the 10 committee members disagreed, as the MPs split on party lines. In his email to staff, Mr Murdoch said the committee's findings were ""hard to read"" but he was proud News Corp had worked to put things right. BSkyB, meanwhile, used its trading statement to point to its ""positive contribution to UK audiences, employment and the broader economy, as well as its strong record of regulatory compliance and high standards of governance"". Price freeze BSkyB's operating profit for the nine months to the end of March came in at £939m, up 25% from the same period last year. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) was £546 in the first three months of the year, which was up £9 from the same stage last year. BSkyB said: ""The impact of this year's price freeze [was] more than offset by our success in selling our home communications products to new and existing customers."" ""The decision to focus our marketing on home communications has paid off with our fastest quarter of growth since launch and confirmation that Sky is now Britain's favourite triple play provider,"" said chief executive Jeremy Darroch. Triple play customers buy their television, telephone and broadband services from the same provider. BSkyB has 3.2 million such customers, up 24% from the same period last year. The churn rate, which is the proportion of customers who left Sky during the period, was an annualised 10.1% - down from 10.4% at the same time last year. Editorial investigations In its statement, Sky said it had concluded a review of the editorial practices at Sky News and had ""found no evidence of impropriety or cause for concern"". It has also reviewed two cases referred to by John Ryley, head of Sky News, at the Leveson Inquiry, in which a Sky News journalist accessed the emails of people suspected of criminal activity. Sky said it had concluded that ""the action was justified in the public interest and subject to proper editorial oversight"". Ofcom is investigating the hacking of the emails of the so-called canoe man John Darwin and of a convicted paedophile, Martin Smith. Rupert Murdoch's son, James, stepped down as chairman of BSkyB on 3 April and was replaced by Nicholas Ferguson. Independent chair A US institutional investor in News Corporation has called for Rupert Murdoch's role as chairman and chief executive to be split and for an independent chairman to be appointed. ""We don't believe it's too late to turn News Corp around, but the company needs to act now to make real and substantive changes to start this process,"" said Julie Tanner, assistant director of socially responsible investing at Christian Brothers Investment Services. ""These scandals will have a long-lasting impact on News Corp's reputation, but by appointing an independent chair and seating independent board members, the company could begin the process of re-establishing public trust. ""Short of these measures, these scandals will continue to cloud the company and its stock for the foreseeable future."" Christian Brothers filed a resolution at the company's annual meeting calling for an independent chairman to be appointed.","BSkyB says it remains a ""fit and proper"" holder of a broadcasting licence."
"The move comes as the Texas company struggles to lift sales. In the fourth quarter of 2017, sales rose by just 1%. Kimberly-Clark said the restructuring would streamline its supply chain, saving at least $500m by the end of 2021. The savings are in addition to a plan to reduce costs by $1.5bn in that time. Kimberly-Clark chief executive Thomas J Falk said the restructuring - which carries costs of as much as $1.9bn by 2020 - will make the company ""leaner, stronger and faster"". ""These are difficult but necessary actions to make Kimberly Clark an even stronger company going forward,"" he said on a phone call with financial analysts on Tuesday. In a statement, he described market conditions as ""challenging"". The company has been forced to cut prices amid competition from rivals and store brands, even as the cost of some raw materials has increased. In addition, executives said the firm has been hurt by declining birth rates in key markets, such as the US and South Korea, which have reduced demand for diapers and other staples. ""You can't encourage moms to use more diapers... when the babies aren't being born,"" Mr Falk said. The firm, which sells items under the Andrex and Huggies brands, reported $617m in profits in the fourth quarter on sales of $4.6bn. For the year as a whole, sales were $18.2bn, almost unchanged from 2016, while profits rose 5% to $2.28bn. Executives said they are hopeful that prices have stabilised. The firm predicted that sales would rise by between 1% and 2% this year. It is banking on a suite of new products to drive growth. The company is also investing in its digital sales, an important part of growth in markets such as China. Online sales represent more than half of the firm's business in China. Kimberly-Clark, which has more than 90 facilities globally including those of affiliates, did not say which plants it intended to close. It said it expected the job cuts to occur across geographies and business units. It also plans to expand in some locations and spend at least $2.1bn on share buybacks and dividends.","Kleenex-maker Kimberly-Clark has said it will close or sell 10 manufacturing plants and cut at least 5,000 jobs - about 12% of its workforce."
"There will be a grace period for projects which already have planning permission, the Department of Energy and Climate Change said. Energy firms had been facing an end to subsidies in 2017. The funding for the subsidy comes from the Renewables Obligation, which is funded by levies added to household fuel bills. After the announcement was made, Fergus Ewing, Scottish minister for business, energy and tourism and member of the Scottish parliament, said he had warned the UK government that the decision could be the subject of a judicial review. Analysis: Roger Harrabin, environment analyst The Conservatives promised in their manifesto to hold down bills and increase renewable energy. But onshore wind is the cheapest readily-available form of clean energy in the UK. That's why some experts have described their decision to kill the onshore wind programme as bizarre and irrational. Speaking to business leaders in London last night, Amber Rudd said it was time to shift subsidies from onshore wind to other technologies that needed them more. But she did not say what those technologies would be, and the government has not announced compensatory subsidies for other forms of energy. Some of the business leaders are baffled why ministers will give local people a unique veto over wind turbines, when they cannot veto shale gas fracking or even a nuclear power station on their doorstep. The government's policies are seen by green groups as nakedly political. Another reason may be partly at play - the right-leaning think tank Policy Exchange calculates that the energy subsidies programme has simply run out of cash. If this is accurate, it presents a formidable challenge to an energy secretary who says she is committed to transforming the UK into a low-carbon economy. ""The decision by the UK government to end the Renewables Obligation next year is deeply regrettable and will have a disproportionate impact on Scotland, as around 70% of onshore wind projects in the UK planning system are here,"" he added. 'Energy mix' The move was part of a manifesto commitment by the Conservative party ahead of the general election in May. ""We are driving forward our commitment to end new onshore wind subsidies and give local communities the final say over any new wind farms,"" said Energy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd. ""Onshore wind is an important part of our energy mix and we now have enough subsidised projects in the pipeline to meet our renewable energy commitments,"" she said. 5,061 onshore turbines in the UK 18,000 gigawatt hours of electrcity generated by onshore turbines in 2014 5.5 million homes could run for a year on that power 5.6% of the UK total electricity needs The Conservatives also say that the onshore turbines ""often fail to win public support and are unable by themselves to provide the firm capacity that a stable energy system requires"". Some reports estimate that almost 3,000 wind turbines are awaiting planning permission and this announcement could jeopardise those plans. Friends of the Earth's renewable energy campaigner Alasdair Cameron said: ""While the government rolls out the red carpet for fracking, they're pulling the rug out from under onshore wind. ""Proposed changes to the planning system could make it more difficult for local authorities to give the go-ahead to new wind installations - even if it's the local community who want to build and run them."" And Gordon MacDougall, managing director of Renewable Energy Systems, a Sir Robert McAlpine Group company, told the BBC that ""what we are seeing is political intervention"". He criticised the intervention in what he says is the cheapest form of low-carbon energy. The grace period could allow up to 5.2 gigawatts (GW) of wind capacity to go ahead, which could mean hundreds more wind turbines going up across the UK.","New onshore wind farms will be excluded from a subsidy scheme from 1 April 2016, a year earlier than expected."
"The currency markets had been expecting a clear victory for Theresa May's Conservatives, but the party does not appear set to win a Commons majority. Sterling fell as low as $1.27, down about two and a half cents from its level late on Thursday. It has since recovered to be down 1.5% at $1.2760, but the market is volatile and traders remain cautious. The BBC is projecting that the Conservatives will be the largest party with 318 seats - eight short of a majority. Given the surprise outcome of the poll so far, the pound could have been expected to fall even more sharply. However, the fact it has not slipped further may reflect the diminishing prospect of a ""hard"" Brexit. Although a hung parliament would mean uncertainty, Neil Wilson at ETX Capital said that a ""softer version of Brexit"" was now more likely. ""Mrs May's mandate to push through her clean, hard Brexit has evaporated. Voters didn't want to hand her the blank cheque for Brexit. It may leave negotiations in limbo but would also tend to suggest that the downside for sterling is limited,"" he said. When will we know who's won?

"The company reported profits of $333m (£217m) in the second quarter. ""The work we've done to make mobile the best Facebook experience is showing good results and provides us with a solid foundation for the future,"" said founder Mark Zuckerberg in a statement. Facebook is the world's largest social networking company. According to chief financial officer David Ebersman, 20 billion minutes a day were spent on Facebook in June. ""This quarter marks the end of our first year as a public company and I think we've created a good foundation for the future,"" said Mr Zuckerberg on a call to discuss the earnings. The company's share price is still down more than 16.7% from its stock market debut price of $38. Mobile boost Facebook saw $655.6m in revenue from mobile ads in the three months from April to June - more than 41% of the total $1.6bn it made from advertising overall, compared with 30% for the same period last year. The number of mobile users expanded 51% to 819 million. Clark Fredricksen of research firm eMarketer told the BBC that the results were ""incredibly impressive - they've exceeded expectations."" eMarketer estimates that Facebook will take in more than $2bn in mobile advertising this year and increase its share of the digital ad market to 5.04% - up from 4.11% in 2012. ""I'd say that Facebook is in a unique position with the ad market right now in that it is very far ahead of any other major ad platform in mobile display advertising,"" said Mr Fredricksen. The company has focused on perfecting its ad sales programmes. Last month, it announced changes to its Ads Manager which it said would provide advertisers with better data. In April, Facebook won back General Motors almost a year after the car company pulled advertising from the site. Video boom Mr Zuckerberg also discussed one of the company's most recent innovations: the introduction of video to Instagram, the photo sharing platform that Facebook bought in April 2012 for $1bn. The video feature was introduced to compete with Twitter's short video sharing service, Vine. ""Adding video fits really naturally with the Instagram mission,"" said Mr Zuckerberg. On the call, analysts asked a question that many have wondered: When will Instagram finally begin to generate any sort of revenue for the company? Mr Zuckerberg, while emphasising that it's ""been clear that we're building Instagram to be a business"", simply said that Facebook was focused on building Instagram's ""imprint"", or user base. He also alluded to two new products that have yet to gain traction with Facebook users: Home, the company's mobile phone software, and Graph Search. Mr Zuckerberg said he thought these products ""will take longer to develop.""",Shares in Facebook have leapt 18% as it beats earnings expectations with stronger than expected mobile ad sales.
"A total of seven firms - including FirstGroup and Stagecoach - are bidding for the Great Western, Thameslink and Essex Thameside rail franchises. Rail Minister Theresa Villiers saidit was part of the ""biggest programme of refranchising since the privatisation of the railways"". The first winner will be announced in December. That is for the Great Western franchise, which the operator will begin running in April 2013 for a term of 15 years. The line runs between London, the west of England, south Wales and parts of the Midlands. Current operator First, which was awarded the franchise since before 1998, said it did not want to take up the option to extend its current contract beyond March 2013, preferring instead to re-bid for a longer contract. ""Our reformed approach to franchising will give more flexibility to train operators on how they configure services and run their business,"" Ms Villiers said. The new winner to operate the Essex Thameside franchise will begin in May 2013. The length of the franchise term will be 15 years. And the winning bid for the Thameslink line will start operating in September 2013 for a minimum of seven years. ""The new Thameslink operator will help oversee the completion of the Thameslink project which will enable a near doubling of capacity into and through central London in the peak periods,"" Ms Villiers said. The seven firms are: FirstGroup, National Express, Stagecoach, Arriva, Abellio, MTR and the Go-Ahead Group. All operate franchises currently.",The government has announced the firms who want to become the next operators of three railway lines.
"Airlines were among the big fallers, with Air France and British Airways owner IAG down 5% and 3% respectively. French hotel group Accor lost 5%. Stock markets in the US, London and Frankfurt all closed up after recovering from early falls. But in Paris the Cac 40 index finished down 0.08%. The price of gold rose 1% as investors sought the safety of traditional havens. On Wall Street, all of the three main indexes eventually ended the day over 1% higher. ""Markets are slowly becoming more and more immune to these types of events,"" said ohn Brady, managing director at R.J.O'Brien & Associates. 'Sign of resilience' Many analysts had forecast that travel and leisure shares would be the big losers on Monday as markets got their first chance to react to Friday's attacks. Eurotunnel Group, operator of the Channel Tunnel rail link, fell 3%. Aeroports de Paris, the operator of Paris' Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, was almost 4% lower, while LVMH and Gucci-owner Kering fell nearly 1%. Budget airline Easyjet fell about 3% in early trading, but closed 0.39% down. Ryanair also fell around 3% in the morning, and closed 1.43% lower. ""In a sign of resilience, there is no sign of the panicked trading that could have been justifiably expected from the European indices,"" noted Spreadex trader Connor Campbell. The tourism sector accounts for about 7.5% of French GDP. ""These Paris terrorist attacks and the larger scale of this attack could have a meaningful negative impact on the travel and tourism sector,"" Robert T Lutts, president and chief investment officer at Cabot Wealth Management, told the Reuters news agency. ""It is possible this could cause investors to take a bit more cautious stance on the higher-risk sectors of the markets."" Hidenori Suezawa, financial market and fiscal analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities, added: ""Given that France has a big tourism industry, there may be some damage to the economy if this leads to a fall in visitors to France, or in tourism in general after the crash of a Russian plane."" Oil prices rise A decline in tourism in Europe could also weaken the euro, analysts warned. But the currency held relatively steady on Monday, and was up 0.019% against the dollar and down 0.55% against sterling. French air strikes against IS bases in Syria led to concerns about oil supplies. The price of Brent crude was down 2% to $43.59 a barrel. But many analysts believe the wider economic impact of the Paris shootings will be short-lived. ""As horrific as these events are - and this is truly awful - economic activity does tend to be pretty resilient. At the end of the day, people have to get on with their lives,"" said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight.",Shares in Europe's travel and tourism companies suffered heavy falls on Monday as investors worried about the impact of the Paris attacks.
"By Kim GittlesonBBC business correspondent, Namialo, Mozambique Once an apparent miracle - a massive banana plantation in the middle of a dry, flat part of a desperately poor country - its formerly lush greenery has now been devastated by a deadly fungus called Panama disease. Five years ago, Tropical race 4 (TR4), as it's formally known, was spotted here for the first time in Africa after killing off millions of bananas in Asia from the 1980s onwards. The failure to contain the disease set off alarm bells around the world. Could the banana, the world's most exported fruit and the source of nutrients for millions of people, be at risk of extinction? The BBC was the first to be given access to the farm since it was hit with the disease. We travelled all the way to Matanuska not just to observe the devastation but because the story of the plantation is about more than just bananas. It's emblematic of unintended consequences of global trade - and the way that solutions to those consequences might come from some very unlikely places. After our disinfectant baths, we continued down a long, red dirt road to what remains of the farm. It's strikingly lush. Trundling along on metal zip lines are hands as they're known - carrying hundreds of bananas to a processing facility, where they too get the bath treatment before being shipped off in Dole-branded containers to the Middle East. Standing over this procession is Elie Matabuana, the farm's head of technical services. He spends all his time looking at every banana grown here to see if they are exhibiting the yellowing leaves and tell-tale rotting smell that indicate a plant has been infected with Panama disease. ""When [I wake] up in the morning the first thing I have in my mind is; what can I do to stop the disease?"" he says. ""It's a really big struggle but we are winning,"" he says, before amending his answer. ""We are going to win."" Containment But Elie and the Matanuska team are fighting an uphill battle. The disease has spread swiftly over the past five years. ""When I first came to Matanuska, it was just after we identified the pathogen and at that stage the farm was just beautiful,"" says Stellenbosch university professor Altus Viljoen, who was the first to confirm that the disease had in fact escaped Asia. ""I knew that that might change. ""But I never knew the extent of that change and how severe it would be."" Today, only 100 hectares are left of Matanuska's original banana plants. Of the farm's 2,700 workers, nearly two-thirds have been laid off -- sending the surrounding economy into a spiral. And containment, along with finding a resistant banana strain, has become a pressing priority. It's estimated that more than half a million people are employed in the banana industry in Mozambique. 'Bad luck' Neighbouring countries like Tanzania, just 600km north of Matanuska, also depend on banana cultivation for a significant portion of their economic activity. And though the type of banana grown for sustenance in Uganda and Congo - where residents get something like 35% of their daily nutrients from bananas - is thought to be resistant, no one knows for sure. ""All African countries are worried about what's happening in Mozambique,"" says Antonia Vaz, the head of plant pathology at Mozambique's Ministry of Agriculture. She says the Mozambican government has implemented control measures to ensure that the disease does not escape the northern part of the country. She's also quick to note the disease isn't endemic to Mozambique. The government thinks it came from the boots of two workers from the Philippines. ""It was just very, very bad luck,"" she says. Each year, more than $12bn worth of bananas, primarily of the Cavendish variety, are exported globally making it the world's favourite fruit both by value and by volume. No cure Usually if there are millions of dollars at stake, solutions aren't that hard to find. But the problem in fighting Panama disease is the way that bananas are cultivated today. The bananas that we eat are Cavendish bananas - often grown to the exclusion of all of the other thousands of types of bananas found in the world. Growing only one variety of a plant is known as monoculture - and it's a practice that became increasingly common across the world in everything from forest plantations to fruit. But monoculture crops are incredibly susceptible to disease. What makes the story of the banana even more dire is that the Cavendish banana is what's known as a triploid - meaning it's sterile. New plants are produced asexually, meaning that they are genetically identical to the previous generation. So hoping that evolution will eventually produce a resistant banana is futile - there is no natural selection to save the Cavendish. New hope But in the face of such odds, why continue to even plant bananas at Matanuska? There are two reasons. One is that ""if that land is simply abandoned and people start moving through there, no one knows who's going to carry the disease where,"" says Prof Viljoen. The other is hope. American Tricia Wallace is a former investment banker who helped to arrange financing for the farm back when the idea of a banana plantation in this part of the world seemed like a mirage in the desert. In the first few years of operation, she tells me: ""People came from other parts of Mozambique and they couldn't believe that this farm existed here and was doing this on this scale."" Ms Wallace says she felt an obligation to ensure that the people here weren't given up on, which is why she ended up quitting her banking job to run the farm. Now, she's invested heavily - perhaps more than any other plantation in the world, in a particular type of Taiwanese Cavendish banana that's known as Formosana. It's this strain that could hold the answer to the world's banana problems, and it's what Matanuska will need to survive. And so far the results are promising, 200 hectares of Formosana are now growing. While some of the plants still get the disease - they seem to be stronger and able to fight it off. Bounce back So a disease from Asia, transported to Africa, due to poverty and grit might end up with a solution, which is then shipped back across the world. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: The banana is, after all, shaped like a boomerang. It's an irony not lost on Ms Wallace. ""You know we couldn't call the Philippines and say come and show us how you solved this,"" she says. ""So if we make this work then I think that there's a huge benefit not only for the rest of the banana industry in Mozambique but the region as a whole.""","Visiting the Matanuska banana plantation is not easy these days. After a two-hour drive from the nearest city in northern Mozambique, visitors who make it to the farm are stopped at the entrance and asked to dip their feet in pools of disinfectant. Even the cars get a bath."
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@KarishmaBBCon Twitter On the campaign trail he regularly said he was against the deal. So Asian leaders have had some time to prepare for this news - but that is not to say Mr Trump's decision will not sting. And it may have lasting economic and political repercussions. Earlier this year, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, speaking at the White House, said that ""in terms of America's engagement of the region, you have put a reputation on the line"" and warned what may happen to the US should it decide to pull out of the agreement. ""If, at the end, waiting at the altar, the bride doesn't arrive, I think there are people who are going to be very hurt, not just emotionally but really damaged for a long time to come,"" he said. It is no wonder that Asian countries are annoyed, to say the least. The demise of the TPP is a ""major blow"" to economic prospects for emerging Asia, as research house Capital Economics puts it. Seven Asia-Pacific countries had signed up to the deal - Japan, Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, New Zealand, Australia and Brunei - along with the US, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. What is the TPP and why does it matter? In simple terms, under the deal, countries would be able to sell their products to one another with low or no tariffs on them. Tariffs are taxes that nations apply to one another's goods to stop them from becoming too cheap and killing domestic industries. In theory, this would bring down the cost of goods for consumers and allow businesses to access new markets. But Mr Trump and his supporters say that the TPP hurts American jobs and industry and that the US should sign bilateral trade deals with its partners. Let's take a look at who stands to lose in Asia from TPP's demise. Singapore Singapore was one of the co-founders of the TPP's predecessor and was a big backer of the deal in the region. The small island state relies on trade for its economy to grow. It is also home to one of the biggest ports in the region and was hoping to benefit from an increase in services such as shipping and trade financing that it was expecting to see from an increase in regional and global trade. Vietnam According to this study by the Petersen Institute, Vietnam was expected to benefit the most from the TPP because it is still a relatively closed economy and through this trade deal it would have gained tariff-free access for its rice, seafood, textiles and low-end manufactured goods. Some estimates say Vietnam could have enjoyed a 10% boost to its economy by 2025 under the TPP. Malaysia According to that same Petersen study, Malaysia's economy could have grown by 5.5% in the same period because of the TPP. Under the deal, it was set to get access to the US for its palm oil exports, but at the same time under the rules of the agreement it had to agree to higher international labour standards. This then was the central premise of the US-backed TPP: join our party, we'll all get rich together and we'll all abide by international standards. Everybody wins. In another study, the Petersen Institute has outlined that the TPP would have created a global annual benefit of $295bn (£236bn) for the world economy. Benefit for China? Of course projections are simply that and are often optimistic at best. But even if you take the worst case scenario and go with half that amount, that is still a lot of trade. Some Asian countries have reacted to Mr Trump's announcement by saying that they will go it alone - but frankly without the biggest player at the party, it is hard to see how it will be a meaningful agreement. There is one country though that could benefit from the death of the TPP. As my colleague Carrie Gracie writes, China is well placed to step into the US's global footprint with both its regional trade deal alternative - the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership deal - and its massive and expensive One Belt One Road initiative, which aims to build roads, ports and highways through much of Asia. This is typically the role the US has played in the past few decades in Asia through its financial bodies and global institutions. According to some analysts, China has been playing what some call the ""New Great Game"" in Asia - a reference to the power rivalry we saw in the 19th century in Central Asia - and will grab any opportunity it can find to increase its influence in the region. Mr Trump may have just handed Beijing just the chance for which it has been looking.",No-one should be surprised by Mr Trump's announcement that the US will quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal on his first day in the White House in January.
"By Lucy Hooker & Philippa GoodrichBBC Business News ""We were literally all packed, kids had their rucksacks,"" says James. ""Half the stuff was in the car."" They were just about to set out on the four hour drive to Alder Country Park in Norfolk, when the phone rang. The holiday that they booked before Christmas was no longer available. ""I was shell-shocked,"" says James. ""We said, how can it not be available? We booked it last year."" Their eldest daughter is in a wheelchair so they plan well ahead to ensure they find somewhere that can accommodate her needs. But they were told that a maintenance problem at the lodge they'd booked meant it was cancelled. 'Sorry kids' In a normal year Hoseasons, the firm through which it had been booked, says it would have tried to find them an alternative, but with demand for UK holidays sky high this year, everywhere was fully booked. ""I came off the phone and said 'sorry kids, no holiday', says James. The younger ones burst into tears. They aren't alone. Dozens of holiday-makers have contacted BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme to say their holiday has been cancelled at short notice. A Facebook page set up by disgruntled Hoseasons customers has more than 500 members. Rod Leaman booked a four night stay at the Welcome Family Holiday Park in Devon through Hoseasons in February. Less than a fortnight before he was due to go he received an e-mail saying that his booking had been cancelled as the dates he'd chosen were no longer available. When Mr Leaman phoned the holiday park itself, he was told that when it reopened in July the owners had decided not to take bookings for less than a week. ""I would happily have paid for the extra three nights, but that option wasn't given to me,"" he says. The booking was for his daughter Claire so she could get away for a holiday with her partner and her fifteen-year-old daughter Rayah. Some disappointed holidaymakers were given no explanation at all. Jill Turner, a teacher from Poole in Dorset, received a text message from Hoseasons, apologising for cancelling the caravan she'd booked for four nights in mid-August. It took Jill an hour to get through to the company on the phone, she says. Even then, she says they didn't offer any reason why they couldn't honour her reservation. After the BBC looked into Jill's case, Hoseasons admitted the caravan had been double-booked. Booking numbers ""I'm really disappointed about the whole situation, that a company who we thought we could trust... that they could send an 'oh we are sorry', when they weren't"", says Jill. ""What was really annoying was that no-one actually seemed to care."" Hoseasons told the BBC that double-bookings had occurred in a small number of cases because of the large volume of bookings and rebookings taking place as lockdown was eased. Hoseasons is part of the holiday rental company, the Awaze group. The group also owns Cottages.com, many of whose customers have reported similar last-minute cancellations. Children's author Michael Rosen was one of them. He spent 47 days on a ventilator after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus in March. As he finally began to recover, his wife Emma-Louise Williams booked and paid in full for a week's holiday at a cottage in Somerset. But four days before they were due to leave, Cottages.com contacted them to cancel their booking, saying the property was no longer available for the dates she had booked. Emma-Louise was later told by the key-holder of the property that it had been double-booked. The holiday firm promised a full refund within 3 to 5 days, as well as £250 in compensation. Duplicate bookings On 31st July, the day James and his family were told their holiday was cancelled, Henrik Kjellberg chief executive of Awaze UK published a letter of apology to customers. ""Though we expected demand to resurface as UK travel restrictions were lifted, we didn't plan for a tenfold increase, which is what we've experienced on some of our platforms in recent weeks,"" he wrote. ""To put it simply - our systems didn't scale to the level we needed them to and this regrettably caused some duplicate bookings to occur."" The firm says as well as the technical glitch there have been a handful of other reasons for cancellations. Hoseasons doesn't own the properties it takes bookings for and says some became unavailable after owners decided to withdraw them, either to use them themselves, or as a result of concerns around Covid-19. The firm says late cancellations have affected less than 1% of bookings in July and August and those affected will be promptly refunded. But customers who contacted the BBC and joined the Facebook site said it has been hard to get hold of Hoseasons to arrange a refund. The firm says it will be adding further capacity by hiring more staff for its contact centre. James and Georgina, who paid the full £1,500 bill for their holiday back in January, have been told they will get some compensation, but they haven't yet received it or their money back. They are still angry and feel they are owed an explanation. Countrywide, which owns Alder Country Park, says the maintenance issue at the lodge, caused by a hot tub, was only identified on the day James and Georgina were due to arrive. Countrywide apologised for the late cancellation. James says he still feels like he's in limbo, but in hindsight it is less about the money than the disappointment. ""It's been tough for everyone - during what's happened in lockdown. It's been tough for Hoseasons, I get that. What I don't get is just dropping it on us with five hours' notice. How can they not have known?"" You and Yours is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 12.15pm","James and his wife, Georgina, both key workers worked long days through lockdown. By the end of July they were more than ready for their holiday."
"Tom Hayes allegedly told one trader that he had managed to keep the three-month Libor rate ""artificially high"". Mr Hayes, 35, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, is facing eight counts of conspiracy to defraud. He denies the charges. Mr Hayes is accused of acting in ""a thoroughly dishonest manner"" in his alleged attempts to rig the benchmark rate. On the second day of the trial, the jury was presented with electronic and audio conversations between Mr Hayes and fellow traders. In one of the electronic conversations submitted to the jury, Mr Hayes is allegedly discussing manipulating the Libor rate with Will Hall, a trader at RBS, in February 2007. Mr Hayes said: ""Three-month Libor is too high, 'cos I've kept it artificially high."" He said he had managed to do this by ""being mates with the cash desks - [JP Morgan] Chase and I always help each other out"". Prosecuting QC Mukul Chawla QC said: ""If you ever needed any evidence of deliberate rigging of rates, this is it. ""This is strategic, isn't it. It's nothing to do with the bank's borrowing rates. It's all to do with Mr Hayes' trading positions."" 'On the low side' The jury was also played a short telephone conversation between Mr Hayes and his stepbrother, Peter O'Leary, who had recently joined the bank HSBC. In the conversation, Mr Hayes can be heard asking Mr O'Leary to persuade the HSBC person submitting the yen Libor rate to keep it ""on the low side"" for a few days. This would allegedly help with Mr Hayes' trading positions. In another exchange with a trader at a different bank, Mr Hayes allegedly wrote: ""Do me a huge favour and ask the cash guys to set one-month Libor low for the next few days. I will return the favour."" Mr Chawla said this was evidence of a culture of ""you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours"" that Mr Hayes developed with other banks. On Tuesday, Mr Chawla accused Mr Hayes, a former UBS and Citigroup trader, of being motivated by ""greed"" and acting as the ""ringmaster"" in an enormous fraud to rig the benchmark interest rate. Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate - is an interest rate used by banks around the world to set the price of financial products worth trillions of pounds. Mr Hayes, 35, from Fleet, Hampshire was first arrested in 2012 before being formally charged in June 2013 with eight counts of conspiracy to defraud over the period 2006 to 2010. The trial continues at Southwark Crown Court.","The trader at the centre of the Libor rate-rigging trial tried to influence other banks to manipulate the key benchmark rate to suit his own trading positions, a jury at Southwark Crown Court has heard."
"The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 51 from 50.3 in July. The PMI is a key gauge of the sector's health and a reading above 50 indicates an expansion. China, the world's second-largest economy, has taken various steps to boost its economy after its growth rate slowed for two quarters in a row. ""We are seeing clearer signs of economic conditions improving,"" said Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JP Morgan in Hong Kong. 'Concrete policy announcement' China's economy expanded by 7.5% in the April to June quarter from a year earlier - down from a growth rate of 7.7% in the previous three months. There have been concerns that its growth rate may slow further in the coming months, not least because of a slowdown in demand for Chinese exports from key markets such as the US and Europe. That has hurt China's manufacturing and export sectors, which are key drivers of its economic growth. Prompted by the slowdown in external demand, Beijing has been trying to boost domestic consumption in an attempt to rebalance the economy and sustain high levels of growth. Last month the government suspended value-added tax and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The decision is expected to benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment. Beijing has also said that it will implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. Mr Haibin said, ""the recent shift in the policy stance and more concrete policy announcement"" had been a key reason behind the recovery in the sector.","China's manufacturing activity picked up speed in August, hitting a 16-month high, allaying some fears of a sharp slowdown in its economy."
"That is currently $7.25 (£4.90) an hour, but individual states can set their own rates. The move will only benefit staff at company-owned outlets - about 10% of McDonald's 14,000 US restaurants. In a statement, the firm said employees covered by the new policy will be paid more than $10 per hour by 2016. The rate is still short of the increase sought by campaigners in recent months. The move follows a similar one by retailing giant Wal-Mart. Franchisees who run around 90% of outlets set their own pay and benefits but this could prompt some of these to improve their own terms. One analyst said this could help offset the cost of the wage rise for the parent company. ""They'll try to paint this as altruistic, but they're increasing their corporate income by doing this. It's not as nice as it sounds,"" said Richard Adams, a former McDonald's franchisee who now acts as a consultant for current ones. McDonald's franchisees pay the company royalties based on sales. Education help Fast food workers across the US have been demanding that the minimum wage in the sector should be raised to $15 per hour. Workers at various outlets, including McDonald's, have held strikes and there have been street protests in many US cities. McDonald's new chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, said the company had ""listened to our employees"" and announced he would introduce ""paid personal leave and financial assistance for completing their education"" alongside a wage rise.","Fast-food giant McDonald's says it will raise the pay of more than 90,000 US employees to at least $1 above the legal minimum wage."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter He needed to get rid of assets to fend off speculation that the supermarket's debt - which was standing at more than £20bn - was becoming a problem. The South Korean sale goes some way to alleviating the business's balance-sheet strain. Speculation was growing that without significant sell-offs, Tesco might need to raise fresh capital from shareholders - never a happy prospect. And with much of its debt needing to be paid off or refinanced over the next five years, down-payments now were increasingly necessary to spark an improvement in the supermarket's credit rating. That is important for Tesco's financial health, as a better credit rating means that it can borrow money more cheaply and pay less to insure itself against the possibility of default. At present, two of the most important credit rating agencies, Standard and Poor's and Moody's, have Tesco at the lowest rating - ""junk"". Dave Lewis, Tesco chief executive, argues that the £4bn proceeds of the Homeplus sale will improve the supermarket's debt profile - it is all being used to pay off what the business owes. And the less money it owes - and the cheaper it can borrow - the more money Tesco can spend improving its UK operation and attracting in new customers. Homeplus was a healthy business, with annual profits between £300 and £400m. Another healthy business that Tesco owns is its data division, Dunnhumby, which is also up for sale. But fears there over falling profits have cut its possible value to below £1bn. Tesco's debt now stands at £17bn, including pension liabilities. So Mr Lewis still has some way to go. Of course, selling businesses does not alone solve the problem of how to get more customers through the doors. Mr Lewis will have to prove to his shareholders that by making Tesco an even more UK-focused business - three-quarters of the supermarket's revenue will now come from Britain - he can still drive significant growth.","It's not quite money down the back of the sofa, but the chief executive of Tesco has been hunting for bits of the business he can sell ever since arriving at the beleaguered supermarket last year."
"Mr Moulding will get £830m in shares after THG hit valuation targets since its stock market flotation this year. The 48-year-old, who has described his background as ""typical working class"" from Burnley, runs more than 100 websites, including health and beauty. The payouts are based on a sliding scale as THG shares soar. The firm, whose websites include the Lookfantastic beauty products business, only listed on the London stock market in September at 500p a share. But the price has surged, triggering a series of payments as the market valuation approached £6.25bn. Mr Moulding will get even more if THG's valuation reaches £7.25bn within three years. He founded the Manchester-based business in 2004 selling CDs. It now sells a range of consumer goods, from cosmetics to protein supplements. THG also powers the websites of major brands, including Honda and Nestle. Mr Moulding's payout dwarfs the £323m awarded to Denise Coates, the billionaire boss of gambling firm Bet365, in 2018. In addition to the share payouts, Mr Moulding will receive a basic salary of £750,000 a year, up from the £318,000 he took in 2019. However, since the flotation, he has committed to donating salary payments to charity. Hitting the valuation targets also means big pay-days for other THG executives, including finance director John Gallemore and commercial director Steven Whitehead. A spokesman for THG said: ""We are delighted with the market reaction to our IPO and that all of our shareholders are benefiting from the strong performance of the business. ""The equity scheme was put in place when THG was a private company, and we are delighted that over 200 THG staff have already shared in the scheme, worth around £200m today."" 'Excessive top pay' THG had several retail veterans as early investors, all of whom have benefitted from the company's stock market flotation, which was one of the biggest in London for several years. Former Tesco boss Terry Leahy, the former Matalan and Asda boss Angus Monro, former Debenhams boss Terry Green, and Scottish retail entrepreneur Tom Hunter, all had multimillion-pound stakes. Mr Moulding's payout has, however, been criticised. Luke Hildyard, the director of campaign group the High Pay Centre, a campaign group, said: ""Payments worth hundreds of millions of pounds are far more than any individual needs or could possibly ever spend, and will strengthen the argument for more effective taxation of corporations and the super-rich."" He also criticised the company's remuneration committee, saying: ""As is often the case, THG's remuneration committee is comprised of other serving executives who personally benefit from the prevailing culture of excessive top pay, and have no incentive to think critically about its costs and benefits - to the business or wider society.""",Entrepreneur Matthew Moulding is set for one of the biggest payouts in UK corporate history after the success of his online retailer The Hut Group.
"Galliford said the offer was too cheap and that it remained confident in its long-term prospects after rejecting the bid. Bovis said the two companies were no longer in discussions. Two years ago Galliford Try abandoned an effort to buy Bovis after it was rebuffed. Bovis had offered Galliford shareholders £950m in shares for its Linden Homes and Partnerships & Regeneration businesses. Before Bovis's offer Galliford's market value was about £598m. Bovis itself had a market value of about £1.34bn. Galliford shares rose 8% in early trading. Bovis said one concern for Galliford was the viability of the remaining business. Buying the Linden Homes and Partnerships & Regeneration businesses would leave Galliford with its construction business, which includes building projects from airports and harbours to prisons and office space. ""Galliford Try did not believe that the proposal fully reflected the value of the housing businesses and the need to ensure that the remaining Galliford Try UK listed construction focused group had a viable capital structure,"" Bovis said in a statement. While Galliford's construction business earns half the sales for the company, it operates on wafer-thin margins. For the most recent six-month trading period, its Linden Homes and Partnerships & Regeneration businesses made £91.3m in profit, but construction posted £6.3m. As house price growth slows through the UK, home builders may look to other ways to maintain their margins, such as mergers. Homebuilders including Bovis are also enduring criticism over the quality of their builds, and an unfolding scandal over the way they sold freeholds to other investors. In 2017, Galliford Try and another builder Redrow saw an opportunity to snap up Bovis which was going through a bad patch. However, both firms had their takeover offers rejected and walked away from Bovis.","Construction firm Bovis offered to pay £950m to buy rival Galliford Try's home building business but was rejected, it has emerged."
"It now expects to make an operating loss of 35bn yen ($335m; £205m) for the financial year ending 31 March 2014. Its initial estimate was for an operating profit of 100bn yen. Nintendo said the key reason behind the downgrade was weaker-than-expected sales during the holiday season. ""In the year-end sales season which constitutes the highest proportion of the annual sales volume, software sales with a relatively high margin were significantly lower than our original forecasts,"" the firm said in a statement. Losing faith It said weak software sales were ""mainly due to the fact that hardware sales did not reach their expected level"". The company cut its global Wii U sales forecast for the business year from nine million to 2.8 million units - a cut of nearly 70%. It also reduced the sales forecast for its 3DS console from 18 million to 13.5 million units. Three months ago Nintendo was standing by its sales projections for the Wii U, despite signs, from the UK at least, that retailers were losing faith in the product. In July last year, UK supermarket chain Asda said it would no longer be selling the Wii U in its stores. Online streaming Nintendo has faced tough competition from rival games console makers, such as Microsoft with its new Xbox One, and Sony with its new PlayStation 4. There is also a general trend towards online streaming of games to make them available over a variety of devices, such as mobiles and smart TVs. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Sony announced that PlayStation Now subscribers will be able to play some of the platform's greatest hits without the need to own a console. Sony said it may offer its games to third-party products as well. 'Disappointing' This month Nintendo's shares received a boost after China lifted a sales ban on foreign video games consoles. The Chinese government said it would allow foreign firms to make consoles in the recently-launched Shanghai free trade zone and sell them across the country. Nintendo's shares have risen 56% over the last 52-week period, reaching a two-and-a-half year high in January, but this latest profits warning - issued after the Tokyo markets closed - is likely to affect the share price on Monday. ""The fact that the Wii U strategy has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens,"" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management.","Nintendo, the Japanese gaming giant and creator of the Super Mario franchise, has issued a profit warning blaming weaker-than-expected Wii U console sales."
"The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in the biggest one-month jump since 1975, according to new data from the US Department of Labor. The leisure and hospitality industries accounted for more than half the cuts. The losses - greater than expected - are believed to now be worse since the data was collected early in the month. Since then, cases of coronavirus have jumped to more than 245,000 and a majority of states have put lockdown measures in place, forcing most businesses to close. State filings show about 10 million people have registered for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks - record figures that far eclipse previous highs. ""It's clear that the pandemic is already having a more significant impact on the labour market than most had expected even a week ago,"" said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics. Sharp reversal The US had logged job gains every month since September 2010, amid a slow but steady recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. The 3.5% unemployment rate in February was hovering near historic lows. The country is now facing the possibility of its largest contraction on record, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at S&P Global. About 1.8 million people told the Labor Department that they were on ""temporary layoff"" last month - more than double the number in February. The agency warned that the true figures were likely even higher, since some firms may have misclassified the status of their staff. While restaurants and bars - which were among the earliest hit by coronavirus lockdowns - accounted for the majority of losses last month, the cuts started to affect other industries, including retail, construction and other services, like laundry and childcare. Even the healthcare sector lost jobs as dentists and physicians shut their doors. The number of people forced to work part-time surged and the rate of participation in the workforce - those working or looking for work - dropped to 62.7% About a quarter of small businesses are two months or less away from permanent closure, according to a survey by the Chamber of Commerce. Economists expect the unemployment rate to rise into the double digits in coming months. The Congressional Budget Office on Thursday predicted an elevated 9% rate could linger to the end of 2021. ""This sudden-stop recession is shaping up to near the economic losses during the Great Recession but over a much shorter time frame,"" Ms Bovino said. ""If this recession worsens, the economic damage would far exceed that of the Great Recession."" Analysis by Michelle Fleury, BBC News New York Say goodbye to America's record long streak of job creation. Almost ten years of jobs growth came to a halt in March, undone by a pandemic. According to a survey of employers, 701,000 Americans lost jobs in the first two weeks of March, even before the lockdowns were in place. And the second survey which helps make up the monthly employment report from the US Labor Department paints an even bleaker picture. The household survey, which asks individual residents how many people are working, showed a stunning drop of 2,987,000 workers for the month. All of this from data that only captures a fraction of the layoffs since it was compiled three weeks ago. Suddenly, the Congressional Budget Office's prediction that America could have a 9% unemployment rate at the end of 2021 looks less far fetched.","A decade of jobs growth in the US came to an abrupt halt in March as employers shed 701,000 jobs amid the coronavirus outbreak."

"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York The German airline said it would de-commission more than 40 aircraft, warning that it does not expect demand to return for ""years"". It said it would also reduce fleets in its other businesses, which include Austrian Airlines, Swiss and Eurowings. Lufthansa's moves could be a hint of more drastic steps to come elsewhere. ""You can't understate the disaster that's unfolding right now in the world's airline industry. There's no sugar coating it,"" said Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst at Teal Group. Parked aircraft While he said that travel demand has bounced back after other disasters and recessions, until the health risks abate he expects other airlines to follow Lufthansa's lead. ""For the next year,"" he said ""to two years, there's going to be a lot of aircraft retirements, a lot of parked aircraft and a lot of utilization reductions."" Global airlines group IATA has said it expects airline passenger revenues to drop by more than 40% this year and warned that more than 25 million jobs in aviation and related industries are at risk. Lufthansa has already idled more than 90% of its fleet since the virus outbreak and held talks with the German government about aid. But offloading aircraft means the ""first permanent capacity reduction"", it said. ""It will take months until the global travel restrictions are completely lifted and years until worldwide demand for air travel returns to pre-crisis levels,"" Lufthansa said. ""Based on this evaluation, today the Executive Board has decided on extensive measures to reduce the capacity of flight operations and administration long-term."" The firm said it will enter talks with unions and its work council quickly to discuss ""among other things, new employment models in order to keep as many jobs as possible"". ""The decisions taken today will affect almost all flight operations"" it said. Mr Aboulafia said in part the crisis is allowing Lufthansa to accelerate plans to dump older, less fuel-efficient aircraft, several of which Lufthansa said were already scheduled to be sold. It is a good opportunity to ""prepare for rebuilding it with better aircraft one day when demand comes back,"" Mr Aboulafia said.",Lufthansa is closing its Germanwings budget airline as part of a wider cutback driven by a decline in travel due to the coronavirus.

"By Simon TulettBusiness reporter, BBC News Not necessarily. Think Hoover, Jacuzzi, Frisbee. When was the last time you ""vacuum-cleanered"" the front room, took a dip in a ""whirlpool bath"", or played in the park with your ""flying disc""? It may seem like a fairly innocuous linguistic slip to confuse brand and product - indeed, you might think it a compliment to the company behind such a successful name - but it could be the sign of a brand in its death throes. 'Badge of origin' If consumers understand the trademark to be the name of the product itself, as opposed to identifying its exclusive source, that trademark loses its distinctiveness. Cue rival businesses, circling the exposed brand and swooping to attach its powerful name to their own products. And if they can convince intellectual property judges that they are entitled to use it because it's now an everyday word, that trademark is dead and buried - the victim of ""genericide"". ""It can be a big problem, because the brand stops being a badge of origin and just becomes a generic term,"" says Allan Poulter, a partner in the intellectual property team at international law firm Bird and Bird. ""The brand is often the most valuable asset of a company - its exclusivity is what puts it apart. If you get to the stage where you no longer have that, the brand is finished."" Jewellery chain Tiffany & Co is in the middle of a legal battle with US wholesaler Costco, which it has accused of infringing its trademark by selling ""Tiffany"" engagement rings. Costco has retaliated, arguing the US jewellery firm's trademark is no longer valid because, it says, ""Tiffany"" is now a generic term for the rings in question (solitaire-style comprising a diamond mounted on a single band with six prongs). Worryingly for Tiffany & Co, in her ruling on Costco's counter claim, US district judge Laura Swain concluded there was a ""genuine factual dispute"" as to whether the trademark has a ""primarily generic meaning in the minds of members of the general public"". Country to country differences The case is set for another hearing in June, but if it eventually concludes in Costco's favour, Tiffany's trademark for one of the world's most famous ring settings would effectively be worthless. It would not be the first brand to visit the trademark graveyard. Escalator, Yo-Yo and Thermos are among those already buried, while there are numerous others arguably hovering at the gates. For some brands, genericide is a disaster taken completely out of their hands. German pharmaceutical firm Bayer was forced to give up its rights to the Aspirin trademark in the Treaty of Versailles, in 1919, which followed its defeat in World War One (it also lost the rights to Heroin, but in hindsight it's probably not so upset about that). The punishment only applied to aspirin's use in victor nations the USA, UK and France, leaving Bayer's trademark still enforceable elsewhere. Doing exactly that keeps Kristina Kersten in full-time work. ""It's definitely the mark in my portfolio with the most workload, that needs the most protection,"" says Ms Kersten, one of Bayer's legal advisers. ""Companies are just not aware that the situation is different from country to country. We have lots of infringement cases in Latin America where drugs are imported from the US but they're not allowed to be sold as Aspirin in countries like Brazil or Colombia. ""It's a very important product for Bayer, and one of our most famous, so we spend a lot of effort defending the rights."" And there are now many more avenues from which the genericide threat can emerge. Online monitoring ""Questions of trademark dilution have gained new prominence with the rise of e-commerce and the emergence of new market intermediaries [like eBay and Amazon],"" warns the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in its latest report on global brands. ""It's growing to the extent that there's so much of it on the internet,"" Mr Poulter adds. ""It's the sheer volume of it. The monitoring of infringements has certainly increased."" Google is so conscious of the problem that it has published ""rules for proper usage"" of all its trademarks, partly to help stem the use of ""google"" as a verb. And Twitter raised concerns about brand genericide in its initial public offering (IPO) in October 2013. Its IPO filing reads: ""There is a risk that the word 'Tweet' could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with any short comment posted publicly on the internet, and if this happens, we could lose protection of this trademark."" It's no wonder companies guard their trademarks so fiercely when, according to the consultancy Interbrand, the value of a brand like Apple is pushing $100bn (£59bn). And another reason is presumably to protect huge investments - according to WIPO, the world's companies collectively pumped $466bn into branding in 2011, the last year for which there is reliable data. And numerous forecasts for 2014 expect the figure to rise to well over $500bn. Brand police So what sort of defences can companies employ? Some have launched marketing campaigns specifically designed to nip things in the bud. A 2003 advert from photocopier firm Xerox read: ""When you use 'Xerox' the way you use 'aspirin,' we get a headache."" But for those wanting to draw less attention, there's always the brand police. NetNames trawls the internet for improper and suspected fraudulent use of trademarks, and then stamps it out. It represents more than 2,000 companies worldwide, and about 25% of the FTSE 100 index of leading UK firms, charging anywhere from £50,000 to £200,000 per client per year. Counterfeit 'explosion' Chief executive Gary McIlraith says the threat to trademarks is much greater than the occasional slip of the consumer tongue or sloppy editorial. ""Anti-counterfeit work has exploded in the last few years,"" he explains. ""Counterfeiting has become much more sophisticated and increasingly clients find their brands being infringed. ""That's where we've seen an enormous growth in our business in particular - we're set to have doubled our brand protection revenues over the last 12 months, and we doubled them the year before that."" Internet marketplaces, email phishing scams, and social media are pretty fertile hunting grounds, Mr McIlraith says, but mobile app stores are fast becoming the biggest offenders. Time-consuming and inconvenient it may be, but policing infringements does not necessarily have to be costly, Mr McIlraith adds. Quite the opposite, in fact. ""In any sophisticated fraud operation, there's a small number of perpetrators making an enormous amount of money,"" he explains. ""If you've got a good legal team who can go after those big fish and seize assets it is possible to make an online trademark infringement profitable.""",Turning a product into a household name is the stuff of corporate dreams. Isn't it?
"GVC Holdings has raised its takeover bid to about £1bn, topping an offer from 888 Holdings. 888 bid £898m for the firm earlier this month, an offer Bwin accepted. GVC said it was ""working on finalising"" its bid, which Bwin said would be considered by its board, although it cautioned ""there can be no certainty that an offer will be made by GVC"". GVC's offer is worth 122.5 pence per share, which will be made up of 25 pence in cash and 1 new GVC share. The 888 deal valued Bwin shares at 104.09p each.

Online gambling companies are merging to try and reduce operating costs as they are exposed to stricter regulation. ""This is a real statement of intent from GVC. The proposed premium over the accepted offer by 888 is such that the bwin.party board will probably have no choice but to reconsider its acceptance of the 888 offer,"" analysts at Davy Research said.

"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter Several Asian telecom firms have told me it is ""business as usual"" for Huawei in their countries. That's despite the US pressuring its allies to hang up on Huawei, over concerns that the firm is spying for the Chinese government. Huawei has consistently denied that it is a security threat, and says it would never hurt its customers. The firm has also been accused by the US Justice Department of stealing trade secrets and breaking US sanctions on Iran. But that hasn't dented its appeal for Asian customers. Huawei is among the main providers of telecoms equipment for operators conducting 5G trials in the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Industry sources say competitors can't match Huawei on cost and technological capability. What is 5G? High-speed internet has been described as the spinal cord of a modern economy and 5G is a key part of that. When it is fully functional it is expected to transform the way we use the internet. Huawei is also a key vendor for operators in emerging markets, like Cambodia, where it has been used as an integral part of the current 4G network. At a basic level, that means being able to download a video in a couple of seconds. At the more sophisticated end, think autonomous cars, smart homes and internet powered cities. A safe and secure 5G network will be critical for a modern economy in the future, says Tom Uren from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) - and that's why Huawei is under such scrutiny. ""Although no company makes perfectly secure products, Huawei presents unique additional risk beyond the ""normal"" risk of buying complex equipment,"" he writes in a piece published on ASPI's website. Mr Uren points to the alleged close links between the Chinese government and local companies, and says Chinese firms are obliged by law to co-operate, support and help with intelligence work. ""The equipment that will comprise the 5G network is not just a passive piece of infrastructure,"" he writes. ""It has total visibility and control of all the connections within the network. It sees who calls who, when, from where and controls what route data is sent down."" Huawei - cheaper and better? Huawei is thought to be a year ahead of its competitors in terms of its technological expertise in terms of what it can offer customers, according to industry sources. Globe Telecoms in the Philippines has partnered with Huawei since 2011 to help modernise its telecoms infrastructure networks. Later this year, Globe plans to bring customers online for the first time by using Huawei equipment to provide 5G connections in homes in areas of Manila where there is no internet. ""5G is an important building block for the Philippine economy's competitiveness. This is the reason we are accelerating our efforts to deploy 5G, so we can provide as many Filipinos as possible an access to the technology,"" Globe chief technology and information officer Gil Genio said in a statement to the BBC. For many countries in Asia, banning Huawei the way the US and Australia have is ultimately impractical. There are few other options. Finding another provider that can beat the price that Huawei offers is tough. While neither telecom operators or Huawei will reveal how much they charge their customers, it is thought the Chinese firm offers as much as a 10% discount to other companies in the market. Then there's the aftercare service that Huawei provides - analysts say it has historically gone the extra mile by setting up customer support networks in countries that Western companies have typically ignored or dismissed as not important enough. Concerns rising But while there are many countries in Asia committed to Huawei, concerns are still creeping in. The international spotlight on the Chinese firm is causing some Asian governments to think twice about using the company's products, according to security analysts. One security firm told me there has been a sharp rise in enquiries by government clients about how potentially problematic Huawei's products are, and what steps they can take to mitigate those risks. ""Some have asked us how much they should worry about whether Huawei is really a liability"", an analyst who consults to Asian governments told me, on the condition of anonymity. ""Countries are increasingly worried that Huawei could be a significant risk because of its perceived connections to the Chinese government."" Still, those concerns have yet to result in an outright ban in South East Asia. Malaysia says it is investigating Huawei before making a decision. For now though, several telecom operators are still using the company to roll out 5G services in the country. One of Singapore's major telcos M1 has partnered with Huawei to trial 5G services in the country. Singapore's telecoms regulator says operators should ""ensure vendor diversity to mitigate risks from dependency on any one vendor"", again not banning Huawei outright. What happens next? Pressure on Huawei from the West is likely to continue. The US administration is reportedly planning to extend restrictions on Huawei with an executive order to ban the use of all Chinese telecoms equipment makers in US wireless networks, and is likely to pressure US allies to follow suit. But that could come at a cost. ""If the US puts a ban on Huawei [in wireless networks], then that will cost the US's 5G ambitions too,"" Samm Sacks, China digital economy fellow at the New America think tank tells me. ""It would mean we wouldn't be able to participate in any blended network in Europe or Asia. And if we are not going to participate that would put us at a significant disadvantage."" This would mean a world of two internets - or what analysts are calling a ""Digital Iron Curtain"" - dividing the world into parts that do business with Chinese companies like Huawei, and those that don't.","Chinese telecoms giant Huawei is facing a global backlash but for many telecom operators in South East Asia, it is still among the preferred 5G partners."
"EE - which operates the Orange and T-Mobile brands in the UK - added it was on track to hit its target of one million 4G users by the end of 2013. EE launched its 4G service in October last year, the first UK network to do so, as it was able to use some of its existing frequency spectrums. Its rivals, Three, Vodafone and O2 will start their 4G services from May. Unlike EE they have been delayed by the need to purchase additional mobile phone network frequencies, which have been auctioned by the government. The extra speed and capacity offered by 4G mobile broadband should provide smartphone and tablet computer users with superfast download speeds. EE, formerly called Everything Everywhere, is a joint venture between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. Turnover at EE in the first three months of 2013 totalled £1.67bn, down 3.9% from £1.61bn a year earlier. The company charges more for 4G than 3G. However, in January it reduced the price of its 4G offering as it sought to boost take-up numbers.","UK mobile phone network EE has said that 318,000 people have signed up to its fourth generation (4G) service."
"The Federal Reserve said it had decided to raise the rate by 0.25% to a target range of 1.5% to 1.75%. Policymakers also signalled they would increase rates twice more this year, while raising the forecast for rate hikes in 2019. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome ""Jay"" Powell also sounded a warning about rising trade tensions. The Trump administration recently announced steel and aluminium tariffs and is weighing sanctions against China, actions that have led to threats of retaliation. Mr Powell said some Fed members are worried about the possibility of a trade war, referencing conversations between central bankers and business leaders. ""They're seeing it as a risk to the outlook,"" Mr Powell said at a press conference at the close of the Fed's two-day meeting in Washington. What does the Fed expect? Members of the Federal Open Markets Committee, which votes on rates, predicted the US economy will grow by 2.7% this year, faster than the 2.5% predicted in December. Officials are also expecting slightly higher interest rates in 2019 and 2020 than they did in December, according to projections released after the meeting, which reflect the median of estimates by committee members. ""This is clearly a firming up of the future trajectory of policy tightening,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. The Fed has been raising rates slowly since 2015, moving the US away from the ultra-low levels put in place following the financial crisis. The central bank is trying to balance a low unemployment rate with the potential for higher inflation. Wednesday's rate increase was widely expected, but there are new faces on the committee, raising questions about whether policymakers will move more quickly in coming months. Economic conditions have also shifted. The US economy grew at an annualised rate of more than 3% during some quarters last year, while the unemployment rate is hovering at 4.1% - the lowest since 2000. Inflation has continued to lag the Fed's 2% target rate, but analysts have said they expect wages and prices to increase this year. Mr Powell said the Fed is ""alert"" to the possibility of inflation and expects inflation to rise in coming months, but is not expecting a sharp increase. ""There's no sense in the data that we're on the cusp of an acceleration in inflation,"" he said. An increase in the Fed's benchmark federal funds rate typically leads to higher rates for consumers and businesses. Savers benefit, but borrowing becomes more expensive, which can dampen activity in industries such as housing and car sales and raise costs for businesses that rely on debt.",The US central bank has said it will raise its benchmark interest rate citing a strengthened economic outlook.
"By Philip SpiersFirstStop Advice In his independent report to the government on reforming the system in England, Andrew Dilnot said that individuals should not have to pay more than the first £35,000 or so of their care costs (as opposed to their so-called hotel costs) during their remaining lifetimes. And they should not have to pay even that if their assets, including their homes, were worth less than £100,000. We asked you to submit questions about paying for care to Philip Spiers, of the advice service FirstStop. Here are his answers. Informal carers provide more support than any government could afford to pay for. The most recent research from the charity Carers UK estimates that there are more than six million carers in the UK. The care and support they provide to help people remain safely in their own homes is valued at a staggering £119bn per year, which is far more than the annual cost of all aspects of the NHS. So on an individual basis, it might seem a cheaper option to pay a carer than a care home, but to pay all carers would not be feasible. The other aspect of course is that most councils will only provide care packages for people who have substantial or higher care needs (this also being a recommendation of the Dilnot Commission) leaving people with low or moderate care needs to rely on family and friends, pay for it themselves or do without. The commission considers the £10,000 ""hotel costs"" could be afforded out of income, given that the median net income of single people aged over 65 year is £11,284. Even those people without any capital at all would have to contribute their income to the accommodation costs, less a small amount retained for personal expenses, currently £22.60 per week in England. Also, present rules state that if your accommodation costs are more than the local authority is prepared to support, then you cannot top up out of your capital if it is below the means test threshold. Whether this rule would continue if the commission's recommendations were implemented remains to be seen. This is clearly so and recent polls have suggested that people are quite prepared to contribute towards a social care system in partnership with government. It requires the government to look at ways of funding the shortfall, which has been estimated previously at a cost of around £4bn compared with the £1.7bn estimated to implement the Dilnot Commission's recommendations. In conducting the means test for care, the local authority will take into account the value of your mother's property. However, although she might be the legal owner, they must also look at who the beneficial owners are, as this may be different to the legal owner. So in the circumstances you describe your beneficial interest should be ignored. You are correct: the council does have the discretion under Section 22(4) of the National Assistance Act of 1948 to allow a different amount from that prescribed for personal expenses in special circumstances. I would recommend that you make a formal complaint against the council. Your argument should be that allowing your wife's uncle to retain the money he needs will cost them nothing after the 12-week disregard period. Then it will just be added to the loan. For the first 12 weeks, when the council is supporting him, it is unlikely that they will concede because this is an additional cost to them. If he has not done so already, then he should claim attendance allowance towards his care costs which he will be entitled to once he is meeting the full cost himself after the 12-week council funding. Attendance allowance is non-means tested and non-taxable and amounts to £73.60 per week. If his property is on the market, it is disregarded for pension credit purposes, so if claiming attendance allowance, he would also be entitled to the pension credit severe disability addition of £55.30 per week. These benefits together should be adequate to meet his service charges, so perhaps the management company can be patient and wait until they are in payment. There is a condition that you must have had care needs for at least six months before attendance allowance is granted, so the earlier you can establish when his care needs arose, the better. There is a very fine line between free NHS continuing care and means-tested social care. If your care needs are assessed to be primarily health care needs, then the NHS could pick up the costs and fund a placement in a care home of their choosing. The NHS is also responsible for palliative care, so if you were terminally ill, it should pick up the costs. As regards the proposed £35,000 cap, councils will set an amount they consider reasonable as a weekly cost and this will be the figure used to notionally calculate when the cap has been reached. You would not be able to reach the cap earlier by choosing more expensive care. Once the cap is reached, if you were in a care home more expensive than the council would normally pay for, you would have to find a way of paying the difference yourself. In recent years, there has been a strong shift by care home operators to providing training for care workers to reach levels of NVQ that demonstrate caring skills. The care home sector would argue that councils do not pay them sufficient rates to allow them to pay more than the minimum wage for carers. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is responsible for registering providers of care services and, through monitoring, ensuring they continue to meet essential standards of quality and safety. Funding for care home placements has been means tested since 1948. The principal being that those who can afford to pay should do so, with a safety net for those who do not have the means. This is how a welfare state works, but it also means that those who are able to afford it have a greater choice of where they may wish to spend the end of their lives. Before your mother's capital depletes to the means test threshold limit, currently £23,250 in England, you should ensure her care needs are assessed by her local authority. Once she reaches the means test threshold, they would be obliged to contribute towards her care costs if she is assessed as needing the care. If the home costs more than the council are prepared to pay, you could argue that part of her assessed needs should be emotional needs and moving her to alternative cheaper accommodation does not match those needs. If that fails, either the care home owner would have to reduce its fees to the local authority rate, or a third party would have to be found to top up. Your mother would not be allowed to top up from her remaining capital. Some benevolent funds assist with top-ups. If your mother moved to the care home in Surrey of her own volition, then she becomes a resident of Surrey and that council's responsibility. If she was assessed and placed in the care home by Somerset social services, then it would become their responsibility, should her money run out. To make sure your mother is claiming all she is entitled to whilst self-funding her care call the FirstStop Care Advice Line on 0800 377 70 70 and ask for Factsheet 1: Self-Funding Care Home Fees. It is true that if you purchase an ""immediate need care fee payment plan"" to cover your shortfall in income, the monthly payments from the plan are paid tax-free if paid direct to the care provider however. As with many annuities, a substantial amount of the payment is deemed to be return of capital for tax purposes, so the amount being paid tax free is minimal. The government might find the cost of making such a tax concession, applying to all care home residents' income, prohibitively expensive. It is not clear that if the Dilnot Commission's recommendations were implemented, they would become retrospective and people who have already paid for care for a period would have this counted towards their cap. Such a transitional arrangement would certainly seem fair. The opinions expressed are those of the author and are not held by the BBC unless specifically stated.

"The day-trips, where passengers don't know the destination when boarding, were popular in the 1990s. Airlines across the region are coming up with different strategies to tackle the pandemic-induced travel slump, with Thai Airways announcing this week it will slash its workforce by 50%. The downturn has led to government bailouts, collapses and huge job cuts. Carriers are dealing with a severe drop in passengers amid ""the uneven roll-out of vaccinations across the world which will only delay the full reopening of borders"", according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). AAPA figures released this week showed that passenger numbers for January were just 4% compared to the same month last year, when 33.5 million passengers flew across the region. On Tuesday, Thai Airways International said it planned to cut its staff numbers in half in the next few years, as part of the troubled national carrier's rehabilitation plan. The airline plans to have 13,000 to 15,000 employees on its books by 2025, having announced last month it will also slash hundreds of management positions and supervisors. Flights to nowhere Qantas was one of the first airlines to offer flights to nowhere, which take off and land at the same airport after low-level fly-bys of iconic Australian landmarks. The mystery flights are the Australian airline's latest tactic to woo more passengers into flying. Flights will be on one of three Qantas Boeing 737 planes from Brisbane, Melbourne or Sydney with economy fares beginning at A$737 (£413, US$577). The all-day package includes activities that range from wine-making and gourmet lunches, to snorkelling on tropical islands. With international borders unlikely to reopen until 2022, Qantas has asked the government for certainty over domestic travel now that Australia's Covid-19 vaccine rollouts are under way. ""What we are looking for is an assurance that at a point in time, or at a point in the vaccine rollout, further border closures will be ruled out,"" Qantas group executive Andrew Parker said. ""Travellers are confused by a patchwork of rapidly changing restrictions and are understandably worried about being locked out of their own home state or intended destination,"" he said.","Qantas is launching ""mystery flights"" in an effort to boost domestic tourism across Australia and spark nostalgia."
"Robert PestonEconomics editor Here is what GSK said about all this yesterday: ""We are deeply concerned and disappointed by these serious allegations of fraudulent behaviour and ethical misconduct by certain individuals at the company and third-party agencies. ""Such behaviour would be a clear breach of GSK's systems, governance procedures, values and standards... GSK shares the desire of the Chinese authorities to root out corruption. ""These allegations are shameful and we regret this has occurred."" Proof You might call this the Murdoch defence, in that the media tycoon distanced himself from wrongdoing at his Sun and now-defunct News of the World newspapers (although the recent disclosure by Exaro of a private conversation he had with Sun journalists has been seen by many to have rather narrowed that distance). It is not just a matter of pride and reputation for GSK that it will need to prove that its China-based executives were engaged in rogue, unauthorised behaviour when allegedly bunging £320m to doctors and officials to secure drug orders. In both the US and UK, bribing officials to win business is a very serious offence indeed. And I am told that high on the list of GSK's priorities for the coming days is to explain to the Serious Fraud Office in Britain and the Department of Justice in Washington DC precisely what it thinks transpired (as far as it can glean). Gesture The company is braced for fines in China. And, since it is fairly clear that the Chinese government is thinking about how to reform the structure and practices of its health service - especially how pharmaceuticals are procured and how much is paid for them - GSK is mulling whether it can make a gesture that would be seen to support such reforms. There is a wider implication of all this, which is that maintaining ethical and legal standards in a sprawling global business appears to be a challenge (ahem) for a striking number of multinationals. Apart from the lapses of Rupert Murdoch's UK newspapers, think about inadequate controls against money laundering at HSBC and Standard Chartered, safety lapses at BP, LIBOR manipulation at a handful of banks, alleged bribing connected to Rolls Royce, questions about how Barclays raised capital in the Middle East, the past scandal of commission payments at BAE Systems, and so on. Big in business seems decreasingly beautiful.","GlaxoSmithKline's corporate defence against allegations that its people in China bribed hospitals, doctors and officials is that its board and head-office executives in London knew nothing."

"Taxi firm Addison Lee is betting its customers will be ready to, in London at least, in just three years' time. It has joined forces with self-driving software specialist Oxbotica, and says the tie-up means it will offer self-driving taxis in the capital by 2021. The move will pit it against rival ride-hailing app Uber, which is also planning to roll out driverless cars on its network in the future, pending regulatory permission. Addison Lee says it will now work with Oxbotica on digitally mapping public roads in and around the capital. The detailed maps will record the position of kerbs, road signs and traffic lights in preparation for autonomous cars. Addison boss Andy Boland said it hopes to offer shared minibus shuttles to passengers, to use to get to work, to study or to the airport. He said the technology would help the firm ""address congestion, free space used for parking and improve urban air quality"". The industry has been forecast to be worth £28bn in the UK by 2035. Mr Boland said he wanted Addison Lee to be at the ""forefront"" of the shift to self-driving cars. The firm, which is owned by private equity giant Carlyle, reported a £20.8m annual loss in its most recent results to August last year. It blamed investment on transforming ""from a London private hire business to a global premium ground transport provider"" for the disappointing performance. Chancellor backing Self-driving cars have been hailed as the future of the ride-hailing industry as well as a way to reduce traffic accidents. Other companies including Ford, General Motors, Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler and car supplier Bosch are also investing in the development of self-driving vehicles. However, there have been warnings that the technology is being deployed before it is ready. Earlier this year, Uber temporarily suspended self-driving car tests in all cities in the US and Canada following a fatal accident. Chancellor Philip Hammond said last year he wanted to have ""fully driverless cars"" without a safety attendant on board in use by 2021.",Would you trust a taxi with no driver?
"By Matthew WallTechnology of Business editor Speeding this process up - without compromising on safety or efficacy - would seem to be in everyone's interests. And cloud computing is helping to do just that. ""Cloud platforms are globally accessible and easily available,"" says Kevin Julian, managing director at Accenture Life Sciences, Accelerated R&D Services division. ""This allows for real-time collection of data from around the world, providing better access to data from inside life sciences companies, as well as from the many partners they work with in the drug development process."" Clinical trials - testing how a new drug works on people once you've tested it on animals - are a crucial part of this process. But they can be very complex to organise and run. There are three main phases, starting with a small group of healthy volunteers, then widening out to larger groups who would benefit from the drug. ""A big phase three trial will cost anything from $30m-$60m (£24m-£48m) for a pharma company,"" says Steve Rosenberg, general manager of Oracle Health Sciences Global Business Unit. These trials may be conducted over 30 to 50 countries and involve hundreds or even thousands of patients - this takes a lot of time and money. ""Patient recruitment has always been the number one problem,"" says Mr Rosenberg. And as drug development targets more specific groups of people, largely thanks to the insights coming from genomics, finding the right patients for such clinical studies is becoming even harder. This is where the cloud can help. ""With cloud and related technologies, we are now able to mine real-world data to find patient populations better, and utilise globally available technology to conduct trials in an even more distributed and inclusive manner,"" says Mr Julian. Saving time Cloud and increasing digitalisation is also helping to improve the efficiency of data collection and analysis. ""Data collection used to be very inefficient, with data being written on paper forms, faxed and then entered into computers manually,"" explains Tarek Sherif, co-founder and chief executive of Medidata, a company that has developed a cloud platform for clinical trials. ""Then it had to be double-checked for errors. It could take up to a year before you could draw any conclusions from the patient data."" Digitising the process and automating the checking process in the cloud has reduced this time to ""one to two weeks,"" says Mr Sherif. And cloud offers many additional advantages to pharma companies, says Mr Rosenberg. ""These days health data is coming from a wide variety of sources, like labs, wearable devices, electronic diaries, health records. Pharma companies can't necessarily handle all the data that's coming in to them. ""So cloud computing helps them do that and gives them a whole bunch of other advantages - the technology is kept up to date, you get the latest security, the latest features and so on."" A spokesman for pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) told the BBC: ""Advances in computing and data analytics are providing new opportunities to improve the efficiency of our research and increase our understanding of a disease or a patient's response to medication."" Speeding up the clinical trial process also cuts costs. ""We were able to save one of our clients about 30% on the cost of running a trial,"" says Mr Sherif, whose firm facilitates nearly half of all clinical trials in the world and counts 17 of the top 25 pharma companies as clients. And Accenture's Mr Julian says: ""We've seen overall savings of 50% - in some cases up to 75% - on the historically labour-intensive parts of the drug development process."" Of course, not all prospective drugs work, or they're shown to work but not any better than existing drugs on the market. ""So the Holy Grail is to fail faster so you're not failing in the very final phases of drug development when you've already spent most of your money,"" says Mr Sherif. Wearables Winning regulatory approval for a drug is only half the battle. Pharma companies also have to convince health services and insurance companies that's it's worth paying for. This means collecting reliable patient data. In the past, patients were often asked to keep written diaries of their experiences with a drug being tested, but these were ""horribly inefficient"", says Mr Sherif. So the rise of electronic diaries and wearable devices is helping to improve the evidence a pharma company can present in defence of their latest drug. With this is mind, Oracle is helping add ""mHealth"" capability to Accenture Life Sciences' cloud platform. And GSK says: ""We've been conducting clinical studies with biosensors and mobile devices for some time. ""Today's digital technology is enabling us to collect and analyse data in new ways - monitoring activity and vital signs in patients, and collecting patient feedback in real time, improving the quality of data we use in the development of new medicines."" Collaboration The cloud is also encouraging more pharma companies to co-operate on molecule development [the building blocks of a potential drug], says Mr Rosenberg, as well as on data analysis. And all this anonymised patient data - historical and recent - can potentially be shared in the battle to combat disease. ""We are seeing clients increasingly use 'virtual studies' - using external and historical data to perform advanced statistical analysis and reduce the need for complicated, costly site-based study activity,"" says Accenture's Mr Julian, citing a collaborative Alzheimer's project between some of its clients and the Coalition Against Major Disease. But while efficiencies in the drug development process are undoubtedly being found, discovering the initial molecule is still very difficult, experts warn. Cloud computing is having a big practical impact, but won't necessarily result in a flurry of ""miracle"" cures.

"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The system which underpins the use of notes and coins was at risk of falling apart, the Access to Cash Review concluded. Millions of people would be lost without cash, it said, but there is a clear trend towards digital payments. So, how would you react to the end of cash, and could you operate without it? Two of many people who contacted BBC News about the issue this week give their views. Stolen cards - what next? Convenience is said to be one of the biggest advantages of a digital wallet - where payments can be made without having to rifle around for the correct notes or coins. But one Cambridge businesswoman said that the case of her stolen handbag showed how life would be more inconvenient without cash. Still concerned about security, she did not want to give her name. She told BBC News about how she had left her bag in the footwell of her car in a supermarket car park while she returned her trolley. In the minute she was away, a thief had smashed the window, grabbed the bag, and was running off with it. Inside the handbag was her purse, carrying her personal and company bank cards. ""In the time it took for me to block all the cards, three of them were used to make 12 purchases adding up to just under £360 using contactless transactions,"" she said. That was frustrating, but the inconvenience came as it took five days to receive all the replacement cards. She said: ""Without my cards, I had to borrow some cash to tide me over until the new cards arrived. If we don't have cash what would I have done? ""Banks can't act in an instant way to replace cards. There is no replacement for cash in all circumstances."" 'I haven't used cash for five months' Travelling, lunch, and all the day-to-day payments in Matt's life mean he is conducting his finances on his smartphone, rather than in cash. The 50-year-old, who works in financial technology, admits that he is an early and enthusiastic adopter of digital payments and money management, but says he has had no need of cash at all in the past five months. ""Someone tried to give me a £10 note the other day and I hardly knew what it was,"" he said. He commutes from Surrey to London and buys his rail and bus tickets digitally. The same is true of lunch and the occasional drink after work. ""Even the vending machine at work accepts contactless, so my wallet is at home,"" he said. ""Every now and then someone only takes cash. The last time I used it was to pay my local barber."" He accepted that cash still had a place for some people struggling with technology, and working in London made it easy to pay without cash. However, he expected future generations to pay digitally. When his son was paid in cash, he put it straight into a bank so he could spend it via his card or phone, he said. 'Tap dogs' - how charities are adapting Gone are the days when charity donations are just loose change thrown into a volunteer's bucket. Fundraisers have adapted by taking card payments, and in the case of animal support charity Blue Cross it is the dogs that carry the technology. A PayPal contactless card reader sits in a pocket of the ""Tap Dog's"" coat, accepting £2 donations via contactless technology from cards or a smartphone or watch. ""We are in an increasingly cashless society and need to be versatile in the ways people can donate to us,"" said Julia McKechnie-Burke, from Blue Cross. ""We love that dogs are able to directly help us raise funds as pets are at the heart of everything we do.""","Cash is at risk of disappearing without action from regulators and the government, according to a major report published earlier this week."
"By Hugh PymChief economics correspondent, BBC News The rise of so-called zombie companies is, to some extent, a consequence of the UK's current record low interest rates. Struggling companies can just about afford the interest payments on their loans, but not much more. There are zombie households, too - those on interest-only mortgages, yet unable to pay off the loan itself. ""A zombie company is one which is generating just about enough cash to service its debt, so the bank is not obliged to pull the plug on the loan,"" explains Mark Thomas, business strategy expert at PA Consulting and author of The Zombie Economy. ""The company can limp along, it can survive, but it hasn't got enough money to invest."" According to R3, the industry group that represents insolvency practitioners, there are an estimated 146,000 zombie businesses in the UK - and, says R3, that figure is on the rise. And according to experts around a third of these - approaching 50,000 - could be doomed to failure if interest rates go up: ""They could pull through, but urgent attention is needed to avoid the catastrophe of multiple failures and tens of thousands of job losses,"" says Christine Elliott, chief executive of the Institute for Turnaround, which represents financial professionals brought in to help ailing companies. But there are concerns that banks are keeping these no-hope companies alive in order to avoid taking further, potentially significant losses - and this, in turn, could be holding them back from new lending, which is needed to boost the economy. More failure needed Finding a zombie company prepared to own up to its status is not easy, but I finally tracked one down in East London. The owner, who does not want to be identified, has been a successful developer for 20 years building up a portfolio of shops and offices in the South East of England. But he is currently stuck with more than £500,000 ($794,000) of debt, which was run up before the financial crisis. Since the credit crunch, his bank has refused to lend any more money to allow him to build houses on his main site, a former knitwear factory. And that has left him in limbo. Speaking to Radio 4's File on 4 programme, the developer says the situation is ""demoralising"" and he feels trapped: ""We are in a hole and we can't really get out because it's not like you can trade... without any money from the banks you can't trade."" The plunge in commercial property values has played its part in the zombie phenomenon. The British Council of Shopping Centres acknowledges that the industry is facing difficult challenges, with one in five centres already defaulting on loans, or in danger of going that way. Property values in the sector have plunged more than a third since the top of the market - but lenders are reluctant to pull the plug because they know they will struggle to sell the assets. The investor and entrepreneur Jon Moulton thinks the zombies pose a threat to the wider economy. ""We do need to have a situation where bad businesses fail, otherwise the economy will stack up with progressively weaker business models and growth will go into reverse,"" he says. So-called forbearance - where banks give a breathing space to borrowers - has been a matter of concern for regulators, too. They have urged banks to build up their capital reserves, so that they can more easily bear the losses when they pull the plug on zombie businesses. Critics of the banks argue they are applying forbearance to avoid making tough decisions on loans. But Derek Sach, head of debt restructuring at RBS, denies that banks are failing to face up to their losses because they cannot afford to plug the holes in their balance sheets: ""We rigorously go through our books on a monthly basis, looking at loans where we should be making provisions - we are taking the appropriate steps to take write-downs wherever we should."" The wider concern for the economy is that money tied up in struggling companies is not available for more vibrant small businesses or entrepreneurs. Andrew Bailey, head of banking supervision at the Financial Services Authority, says the issue is high on his list of priorities: ""It's not a bad thing to be extending credit terms to companies in this way, providing it isn't choking off new lending and new investment. ""That's why we and the Bank of England are so focussed on that question,"" he told File on 4. ""Zombie companies"" is not a phrase that bankers and regulators like to use. Most shy away from the idea and prefer to talk in their usual jargon, like ""forbearance"" and ""provisions"". But there is no doubt that the dead hand of the zombies is casting a shadow over the economy. Listen to the full report on File on 4 on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday, 13 November at 20:00 GMT and Sunday, 18 November GMT at 17:00 GMT. Listen again via the Radio 4 website or the File on 4 podcast.","You may have seen zombies in horror movies - the bodies of lost souls, neither alive nor dead - but experts are increasingly talking of a zombie colony in the UK economy, which is expanding and threatening to impede recovery and a return to growth."
"The Extended Fund Facility is designed to stabilise Ukraine's economy, restore growth and improve living standards. On top of the IMF funding, the programme also agrees ""other bilateral and multilateral funding"" to a total value of about $40bn. The World Bank will provide up to $2bn of that package and said it is ""vital"" that Ukraine pushes through reforms. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said the deal could prove a ""turning point"" for Ukraine. But Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatseniuk said that the aid package included ""very difficult"" reforms. Ms Lagarde said it was an ambitious programme and not without risk. She said: ""This new programme offers an important opportunity for Ukraine to move its economy forward at a critical moment in the country's history.'' It came as Russia's Vladimir Putin, Ukraine's Petro Poroshenko, and leaders of France and Germany announced that a ceasefire would begin in eastern Ukraine on 15 February, Ms Lagarde said that the deal was ""a realistic programme and its effective implementation, after consideration and approval by our executive board, can represent a turning point for Ukraine"". Mr Yatseniuk said the IMF was demanding reforms to fight corruption, overhaul the energy sector, cut state expenditure and reduce state bureaucracy. He said he expected a total of $25bn financial support from the IMF as part of a four-year facility, including $17.5bn to stabilise the financial situation in the country.

"Eike Batista - who was once the country's richest man - was among nine people issued with arrest warrants on Thursday in connection with a wider $100m corruption scandal. He is accused of paying $16.5m (£13m) in bribes to former Rio governor Sergio Cabral to win government contracts. Mr Cabral was detained in December. According to reports, police failed to find Mr Batista when they raided his home in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday and believe he may have flown to New York using a German passport. Mr Batista's lawyer, Fernando Martins, said he was travelling and planned to turn himself in on his return. However, police said they would class him a fugitive if he did not contact them soon and would seek his arrest through Interpol. Daniel Gallas, BBC South America business correspondent During much of the last decade, Eike Batista was seen by many as the face of Brazilian capitalism. Bold, extravagant and charismatic, he made most of his fortune during the commodities boom that brought great wealth to Brazil. But Mr Batista has plenty of critics too. Some say he was overconfident and sold projects to investors that were too good to be true - and were never concluded. And in the past years, he made the headlines with all sorts of legal troubles - being accused of money-laundering and even stock exchange fraud. In the process, he is reported to have lost all of his fortune, which at one point was estimated to be about $34bn. Some will say that Mr Batista remains a symbol of the Brazilian economy, where false promises of great wealth ended in crisis and court battles. Mr Batista, 60, made his fortune during Brazil's commodities boom of the last decade, with his Grupo EBX conglomerate spanning mining, oil, shipbuilding and logistics. By 2012 he was listed by Forbes Magazine as the world's seventh richest man, with an estimated fortune of $35bn. But by 2013, Grupo EBX had collapsed after global demand for commodities crashed, and Mr Batista's wealth slumped to under $1bn. His arrest has been linked to a wider corruption probe in Brazil into the so-called ""Car Wash"" scandal. It has focused on relationships between members of the current PMDB party administration, the former Workers Party administration, and some of Brazil's most prominent businessmen over contracts at oil company Petrobras and other state firms. More than 100 people, including Brazil's most powerful building tycoon, Marcelo Bahia Odebrecht, have been convicted of crimes such as bribery, racketeering and money-laundering.",Police are seeking one of Brazil's best known businessmen after he failed to turn himself in as part of a corruption investigation.
"By Rebecca WearnBusiness reporter, BBC News ""I think currently it's actually taken over my life,"" he says. He shows us around, pointing out what he calls the ""endless list"" of problems he's encountered since October 2016 when he moved in. ""You find one problem and that escalates into another problem - it's like opening a can of worms."" From substandard ceilings to badly-fitted fire-doors, missing insulation and condensation issues. Both his kitchen and a bathroom have had to be ripped out and replaced. He and his wife have moved out twice while repairs were done. It has been dealing with builder Taylor Wimpey, as well as the issues themselves, that have taken its toll. No coincidence? ""They make it deliberately difficult to contact them, they don't respond to you, they'll tell you something is fixed when it isn't."" Mr Revell says. ""A lot of people don't have the time or the knowledge to take the builders on."" He's joined forces with his neighbour Lyn Whiteman to help manage the problem. ""It's not a coincidence that two houses two doors down from each other with identical problems,"" she says. ""This is not isolated to this particular property or this estate - it's got to be national."" Taylor Wimpey says it apologises for the issues experienced by Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman and for the inconvenience caused. But could the two be right about a broader problem? The Homeowners Alliance says they have seen an increase in the number of people approaching them for help over the last two years because of serious defects with their new-build homes. Research from the organisation, which represents the interests of homeowners to the house building industry, suggest that only two-thirds of new homeowners are happy with the way their builder resolved any defects with their home. And even the developers themselves acknowledge the problem. The Home Builders Federation own satisfaction surveys show a rise in the number of customers reporting snags - from 93% in 2015 to 99% in 2018. That data comes just weeks after the government said they were considering removing Persimmon from the Help To Buy scheme after increasing concerns over the quality of its building work. 'Major failings' And there is rising alarm from consumers and experts about the severity of these so-called snags. Timothy Waitt has become a specialist on construction cases at Anthony Gold solicitors. ""I'm not talking about dodgy kitchen units - I'm talking about major structural failings that affect health and safety."" Mr Waitt is getting enquiries on a near-daily basis on these kinds problems and is fearful a skills shortage in construction means that it is just the tip of the iceberg. ""I do not think we're talking about deliberate decisions to miss out on key expensive structural elements,"" he explains. ""This is about carelessness. I think what is arising is that people are making mistakes, potentially because they do not realise the significance of what they are doing, due to a lack of training, a lack of experience and a lack of supervision."" Like Mr Waitt, the BBC has spoken to a broad spectrum of homeowners across the country and across developers, whose ""snags"" go far beyond the kind of teething problems often anticipated with new builds. From Debbie, dealing with rising damp and poor drainage in East Sussex, to Saima in Wokingham where damp and mould drove her family out of their home or Robert in north London who has endured eight years of fighting to fix floors dipping in his home. What unites them all is the severe emotional strain it's placed on them. Snagging retention As a result, The Home Owners Alliance is campaigning to boost the rights or protection for buyers. ""There is no incentive for a builder to build right and move on,"" explains chief executive Paula Higgins. ""So that's why we're calling for a snagging retention so people can hold back some money and the builders will get things done properly."" Issues with snags occur across developers and building businesses. In this case, Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman's homes were built by Taylor Wimpey. Taylor Wimpey says: ""We sincerely apologise to Mr Revell and Ms Whiteman for the issues experienced with their homes and for the inconvenience caused as we undertook remedial action. ""We are committed to delivering homes of the highest quality and service and we take our responsibilities to our customers extremely seriously. ""We have taken actions to put things right for these customers and all necessary works for both residents have now been completed as agreed. These works are in line with, and in some parts exceed, building regulations."" ""All our homes are subject to strict quality checks throughout construction, examined by the NHBC at key stages and are not handed over until a full quality inspection has taken place."" Warranty claims fall As well as a developer's guarantee for the first two years, warranties are provided on new build homes. The National House-Building Council protects 80% of them from years three to ten in a property, and they say the quality of new homes continues to improve. ""While we cannot be on site at all times, these visual, spot-check inspections are designed to target critical elements of the build process and allow us to highlight potential defects to the builder,"" says the NHBC. ""As most problems that arise in the first two years will be dealt with by the builder without reference to NHBC, we do not collect data on snagging; however, one barometer would be complaints received by NHBC, and these have not increased. ""In addition, new warranty claims continue to fall, with this trend being a clear sign that the quality of new homes covered by NHBC continues to improve."" A Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson says the government wants to see more good quality homes: ""We know more needs to be done to protect consumers, and our New Homes Ombudsman will protect the rights of homebuyers and hold developers to account.""","When Justin Revell bought his new-build house near Norwich, he thought it was the dream home."
"Baker Hughes, the industry's third largest services provider, confirmed US press reports, adding that the talks were ""preliminary"". Any deal with Halliburton, the sector's number two behind the far larger Schlumberger, is likely to face competition issues.

"If the plan is approved, 2,000 House of Fraser jobs will go, along with 4,000 brand and concession roles.

The firm's boss said the decision to close stores was ""as tough as it gets"". Speaking to the BBC, House of Fraser chief executive Alex Williamson described the move as ""brutal"", adding ""we have not taken this decision lightly"".

""Our legacy store estate has created an unsustainable cost base which, without restructuring, presents an existential threat to the business."" Accountancy firm KPMG, which is overseeing the insolvency process, said the firm had been hit by ""mounting pressures facing the UK High Street"". In addition to the store closures, the department store chain is seeking to cut rents by 25% on 10 of the stores it is keeping open. Of the 31 stores it wants to shut, it is seeking a 70% rent reduction for seven months, after which the stores will close. Analysis By Emma Simpson, BBC business correspondent House of Fraser has been living hand to mouth for months. Axing half its stores is a drastic attempt to save the business from collapse. This is a chain that's had more than its fair share of financial ups and downs over the decades, with a colourful array of owners. But the chain has gradually lost its relevance and suffered from a lack of investment. It's been struggling for a long time. And in the last year, the increasingly tough conditions on the High Street has exposed its weaknesses, with the result that its problems have finally come to a head. Even with these store closures, House of Fraser still need to have the right products and experience to pull shoppers into the stores that will be left. Shoppers 'shocked' A CVA is an insolvency process designed to let a firm with debt problems reach an agreement with creditors to help pay off part or all of its debts and avoid administration or liquidation. Richard Lim, chief executive of analyst firm Retail Economics, said the plan to shut House of Fraser's Oxford Street store and 30 others was ""a huge statement of intent"". ""The closure of such an iconic flagship store signals the massive restructuring task at hand,"" he said. ""Department stores are incredibly expensive to operate and the last few years have seen costs spiralling upwards from business rates, rents and National Living Wage."" Shoppers outside the Oxford Street store in London expressed surprise at the news of the closure plans. ""I'm shocked,"" said one. ""I've been a customer here for 21 years. I thought, maybe, because it's Oxford Street, they may not close this one. People come to Oxford Street - even if it's just for a look round."" A second shopper said: ""Very, very surprised. I do shop here and it's got all the things I need, make-up, clothes - it is a lovely store."" House of Fraser started with a shop in the centre of Glasgow almost 170 years ago. It became a retail empire with more than 100 department stores, including iconic luxury store Harrods in 1959. Owner Hugh Fraser also acquired Kendals in Manchester and Rackhams in Birmingham. Hugh's son, also called Hugh, expanded the portfolio with a further 50 stores. The Fraser dynasty came to an end in 1985, when Mohamed al-Fayed took it over.

"Daniel Bonventre, 67, was also ordered to forfeit $155bn (£99bn). Bonventre is one of five former Madoff employees found guilty of conspiracy in March. The others are expected to receive their sentences this week. Madoff's Ponzi scheme fraud is estimated to have cost investors $20bn. He is currently serving a 150-year jail term, having been found guilty and sentenced in 2009. 'Lack of remorse' ""Mr Bonventre, you lived a prestigious and luxurious life,"" the judge, Laura Taylor Swain, said at a hearing. ""We now all know it was supported by a massive fraud."" The US government has determined that Bonventre, as well as Madoff's former secretary, Annette Bongiorno, 66, computer programmers Jerome O'Hara, 51, and George Perez, 48, and account manager Joann Crupi, 53, are the most culpable of Mr Madoff's former associates. Prosecutors have been pushing for longer jail terms to be handed to them, after Mr Madoff's brother, Peter, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2012. ""Bonventre's hubris and lack of remorse is simply staggering,'' they wrote to the judge, arguing for significantly more than 20 years. However, Bonventre's lawyers said that he was also fooled by Madoff, and was not as crucial to carrying out the scheme, as prosecutors were claiming. ""I was used by the ultimate con man,'' Bonventre said before his sentence was pronounced, according to the Associated Press.",A former associate of Bernie Madoff has been sentenced to 10 years in jail for aiding the disgraced Wall Street financier in his $65bn (£42bn) fraud scheme.
"Pre-tax profit for the year to 15 March rose by 16.3% to £898m. However, like-for-like sales, which strip out trading at new stores, excluding fuel, rose by just 0.2%. The firm said it had maintained market share in a ""tough retail environment"". The big four supermarkets are being challenged by low-cost rivals including Aldi and Lidl. The big four have responded by cutting prices in an attempt to stem the loss of customers to the low-cost chains. Price war Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King - who will be leaving the company in July - told the BBC that the retailer would, ""match the price activity of our competition - we always have"". ""There's always a price war in supermarket retailing. Occasional skirmishes break out, I guess this is one of them,"" he added. ""In the end it isn't just about price. Quality, the provenance of sourcing is a big factor as well."" Sainsbury's said sales of general merchandise were increasing at more than twice the rate of food. The relaunch of its clothing brand, which represented its single biggest investment in its clothing business since 2004, had helped generate sales of £750m. The supermarket's results come a month after Tesco reported a second fall in profits in as many years. The UK's biggest supermarket chain said group trading profit fell 6% to £3.3bn, with like-for-like sales down 1.4%. 'Relief' for investors In March, Sainsbury's had reported its first quarterly fall in like-for-like sales for nine years, with sales down 3.1% in the 10 weeks to 15 March. However, Sainsbury's underlying full-year profits beat analysts' expectations, rising 5.3% to £798m. Despite this, the company warned that trading was expected to remain tough. ""While the general economic outlook is showing some signs of improvement, conditions in the food retail sector are likely to remain challenging for the foreseeable future as customers continue to spend cautiously,"" Mr King said. Analysts called the results solid, adding investors were likely to ""breathe a sigh of relief"". Manoj Ladwa, partner at TJM Partnership, added: ""Despite numbers across all metrics showing signs of improvement, management won't be able to sit on their laurels as the retail environment continues to remain tough."" Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers, said: ""Accompanying management comments again point to challenging conditions, concerns for a further ratcheting up of the current price war persist, whilst the change of chief executive does, understandably, raise some nerves."" Sainsbury's share price rose 1.92%, or 6.4p, to 339.8p in early trading on the London Stock Exchange. Transformation In January, Sainsbury's announced that Mr King was to leave the supermarket group in July after 10 years at the head of the company. Mr King is credited with the transformation of Sainsbury's fortunes during his time in charge. Sainsbury's chairman David Tyler pointed out that under Mr King customer transactions had increased by 10 million a week to around 24 million. He added annual sales had grown by £10.3bn to £26.4bn, while underlying pre-tax profit had trebled. Mr King will be succeeded as chief executive by Sainsbury's commercial director Mike Coupe. Competition The latest supermarket industry figures from market analysts Kantar Worldpanel, for the 12 weeks to 27 April showed the UK grocery market grew by just 1.9% - its slowest pace for 11 years. Among the ""big four"" supermarkets, Asda proved the most resilient, holding its 17.3% market share and narrowly beating the market with 2% year-on-year growth. Tesco's market share fell 2.4% compared with the same period a year ago to 28.7%. Sainsbury's and Morrisons also suffered declines in their market share in the period. Sainsbury's market share fell 0.3% to 16.6% compared with a year earlier, while Morrisons' market share fell 3.6% compared to year before to 11%. Tesco and Morrisons also recorded a fall in actual sales. Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl all achieved record growth in market share in the period. Waitrose's market share rose to 5.1%, Aldi rose to 4.7% and Lidl rose to 3.5% market share.","UK supermarket chain Sainsbury's has reported a rise in annual profits but warned of ""challenging"" times ahead."
"Manufacturing output was down 0.5% compared with the same month in 2014, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. But the overall index of production (IoP), which also includes mining and quarrying and utilities rose 0.8% over the same period. The IoP accounts for about 15% of the UK economy. It means that production is still 9.3% below its pre-downturn peak, achieved in the first quarter of 2008, while manufacturing is 5.2% below its peak. Analysis: Robert Peston, economics editor If the British economy was driven by manufacturing, we could well be in seriously dire economic straits, figures released today show. So perhaps we should be profoundly grateful that the coalition government elected in 2010 failed so miserably in its ambition to rebalance the UK towards the makers and away from services. Read more from Robert The main drags on the manufacturing figures were basic metals and metal products, transport equipment and ""other manufacturing and repair"". Trade in goods increased the deficit in the latest trade figures, which were also released on Wednesday. The trade deficit shows how much more the country is importing than it is exporting. The overall deficit in the trade in goods and services was estimated to be £3.4bn in July, up £2.6bn from June. That widening was attributed to trade in goods, in which the deficit was £11.1bn, compared with £8.5bn in June.","The UK manufacturing sector had a weak month in July, according to official figures."
"The Markit/CIPS services purchasing managers' index (PMI) hit 60.5 in August, up from 59.1 in July. Any score above 50 indicates expansion. But a similar survey suggested that growth in the eurozone's services and manufacturing sectors slowed. Experts said this would put pressure on the European Central Bank to act at its meeting on Thursday. The UK PMI survey represented the sharpest rise in business activity in the service sector since October last year. Demand remained strong with marketing activity increasing as a result, it found. There were, however, concerns about future levels of business, leading to a fall in overall business confidence to a 15-month low. Earlier this week, the PMI survey of the manufacturing industry showed the sector grew at its slowest pace in 14 months. ""An acceleration of growth in the vast services sector and an on-going construction boom offset a weakened performance in manufacturing in August,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. He said the services and manufacturing data suggested the UK economy was on course to post ""strong"" economic growth in the current quarter, in line with the 0.8% recorded in the first two quarters of this year. 'Weakest growth' The eurozone PMI survey suggested the region's economic recovery slowed in August as output fell in France and Italy. The Markit/CIPS eurozone purchasing managers' index (PMI) was 52.5 in the month, down from 53.8 in July. The score marks the economic bloc's weakest rate of growth in the year so far, Markit said, with output growth slowing in both the manufacturing and service sectors. ""The eurozone economy is defying expectations of gaining momentum, which will no doubt add to calls for the ECB to embark on full-scale quantitative easing,"" said Mr Williamson. The ECB is due to make its latest decision on interest rates on Thursday. Two of the major eurozone economies, France and Germany, had mixed fortunes last month, Markit's data suggest. France's overall PMI reading for August was 49.5, suggesting continued contraction despite a slight increase in service sector activity. Ructions in the French economy contributed to the French government being dissolved in August, and Markit figures suggest a sharp fall in manufacturing output. Germany saw strong growth, but overall output growth slowed to 53.7 in August, down from 55.7 in July. Italy dipped back into contraction in August, halting a seven-month sequence of expansion. But Spain reached a 7.5-year high in output growth, and posted its sharpest rise in service sector activity growth since December 2006 after an increase in new business. Ireland's output hit 61.8, a 14-year high.","The UK services sector has recorded its fastest growth for almost a year, a survey suggests."
"Brexit is the ""largest near-term risk"" to the UK economy, the IMF said in its annual UK economic outlook. It added that the net economic effects would probably be ""negative and substantial"". But economists for the Brexit campaign said the consensus that a UK exit would be bad for the economy was ""based on flawed EU-centric models"". Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused UK Prime Minister David Cameron of holding the referendum to ""blackmail"" and ""scare"" Europe, and France's economy minister says Britain would become as significant as Guernsey if it voted to leave. 'Substantial Brexit costs' There are five days to go until the UK votes on whether to stay in or leave the European Union on 23 June. In other developments: The IMF said that under its least adverse scenario for Brexit, by 2019 UK GDP would be 1.4% below what it would be should the UK vote to stay in the EU. Its most adverse Brexit scenario predicts 2019 growth 5.6% below what it would otherwise have been, and also a drop in GDP in 2017 of 0.8%, which an IMF official described as a ""recession"". Under this scenario the UK would return to GDP growth of 2.9% in 2021. But the UK would have missed out on 4.5% of growth by then, it said. Following a Brexit, the IMF said the UK would have to negotiate new trade terms with the EU if it wanted to stay in the single market. If not, the UK could rely on World Trade Organization rules, but this would ""significantly raise trade barriers"", the IMF said. A long period of uncertainty would also lead to market volatility and discourage investment, it said. Concerns about the economic effects of a Brexit may have already begun to affect markets such as the housing sector, the IMF added. ""On balance, the net economic costs of an exit are likely negative and substantial,"" it said. Analysis By Andrew Walker, BBC News What do these losses predicted by the IMF mean? If the analysis is right then we would be worse off than we would be if we were to remain in the EU. In the adverse short term scenario we would for a while be worse off than we are now, but even in that situation growth would resume and take average living standards to a level higher than today. It's just that they think if we remained they would be even higher. Which raises (at least) two questions. Is that missed opportunity to be better off a price worth paying for whatever other advantages you might think leaving would bring? And the other question, of course - is the analysis right? Most economists would say, broadly speaking, ""Yes, it is"". But there are some serious members of the profession who say no; ultimately we would do better economically outside. And many campaigners say this is a profession that didn't see the financial crisis coming. 'Doom and gloom' Campaign group Economists for Brexit said the widespread view that Brexit will be bad for the economy in the long term because of bad trade effects and in the short term because of uncertainty was ""based on flawed EU-centric models"". Campaign co-chairman Patrick Minford said: ""The IMF report, like the Treasury's, uses flawed models and makes wrong, deceitful assumptions to project doom and gloom from Brexit whereas with solidly based models and assumptions Brexit gives the UK more growth and better living standards."" Mr Minford said the best outcome would be for the UK to use World Trade Organization rules ""under which the UK would leave the EU, freed from both Single Market regulations and from free EU movement of people."" ""Under this option the UK would get rid of EU trade barriers on the rest of the world, so ridding our consumers of a huge burden of EU protectionism of food and manufacturing; consumer prices would fall 8% and GDP would rise 4% in the long term due to the dynamic response of the economy to lower costs."" 'Partial' analysis Matthew Elliot, chief executive of Vote Leave, said: ""If we Vote Leave we can create 300,000 jobs by doing trade deals with fast growing economies across the globe."" Vote Leave said that the IMF analysis was ""partial"" and did not provide any analysis of a new bilateral free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. It added that ""the real risk to the economy is staying tied to the failing eurozone"". Speaking to reporters in St Petersburg, Mr Putin said of Mr Cameron: ""Why has he set up this referendum? To blackmail Europe? Or to scare it? What is the purpose if he himself is against"" Britain leaving the EU. He declined to give his own view on Brexit, saying: ""It's not our business - it is the business of the British people. I have my opinion on the subject but I will not speak about it in advance."" He also said it would be ""inappropriate"" to try to predict the result. Meanwhile, French minister Emmanuel Macron told Le Monde newspaper: ""Leaving the EU would mean the 'Guernseyfication' of the UK, which would then be a little country on the world scale. ""It would isolate itself and become a trading post and arbitration place at Europe's border,"" he said.","A UK exit from the European Union could mean the UK misses out on up to 5.6% of GDP growth by 2019, the IMF has warned."
"Net income at PSA Group, which also owns Citroen, jumped 92% last year to 1.73bn euros (£1.47bn). PSA's possible purchase of GM's European brands has raised fears of job losses at Vauxhall in the UK. On Wednesday, PSA said it had promised Theresa May it would ""develop"" the Vauxhall brand if the deal goes ahead. But it offered no further commitments to protect the 4,500 jobs making cars at Ellesmere Port and vans in Luton. The two firms are expected to sign a statement of intent during the next two weeks. General Motors announced last week it was in discussions over selling its European brands, Opel and Vauxhall, to PSA. That prompted speculation that the French company would cut capacity by closing plants. Politicians in Germany and the UK have begun lobbying on behalf of their own locations. On Wednesday evening UK Prime Minister Theresa May spoke to PSA chief executive Carols Tavares on the telephone. During the call, PSA chief executive Carlos Tavares ""expressed his willingness to develop further the iconic Vauxhall brand for the benefit of its faithful customers"", PSA said in a statement. PSA said its operating margin, the level of profit it makes on sales, had risen from 5% in 2015 to 6% in 2016. It is the third year in a row that operating margin, sales and net profit have improved at the group, which flirted with bankruptcy in 2014. As a result of the company's improved performance, chief financial officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon said PSA was in a position to make ""profitable investments in the interest of our shareholders"". However, he added that the outcome of the talks with GM were not yet certain. Analysis Theo Leggett, BBC business reporter According to Carlos Tavares, Opel needs help. It has, he says, been making red ink for 10 years and burning 1bn euros in cash every year. If you put it that way, it's easy to see why General Motors wants to get rid of it - but why is PSA Group so interested in taking it on? In today's press conference, Mr Tavares set out a few reasons. And one of them seems to be the international reputation of German-built cars compared to their French rivals. In some countries, he said, French-built cars simply don't sell. He didn't specify where, although the United States would appear to be a prime example. Combining the two companies would also generate cost savings. And having engineered a rescue for PSA itself, when the French giant came close to going bust in 2014, Mr Tavares knows how to turn a failing business around. So there's logic in the planned deal. But Mr Tavares can have no illusions about the political sensitivities involved. Despite his promises to honour existing labour agreements, analysts believe job cuts at some point are inevitable. So the road ahead could be a rocky one.","The owner of French carmaker Peugeot has reported a near doubling of profits, as it considers buying General Motors' (GM) Opel and Vauxhall brands."
"The shadow chancellor said regulators must take action after the ""massacre"" of protesters this week. The people were killed in clashes when police opened fire on protestors. Residents have been staging protests for months, saying that the smelter is causing environmental damage. Copper plant shut after deadly protests India's Tamil Nadu state - where the copper smelter is based - has said it wants it permanently closed on environmental grounds. But Vedanta has said it plans to continue operations. Mr McDonnell said removing Vedanta from the London Stock Exchange ""would prevent further reputational damage to London's financial markets from this rogue corporation"". Vedanta has been contacted for a response to Mr McDonnell's comments and the London Stock Exchange declined to comment. Amnesty International said this week that police had ""many questions to answer"" and ""those responsible should be brought to justice"". P. Ramnath, chief executive of Vedanta's India copper business, said it was not planning to set up a smelter elsewhere. ""We're confident that we will be able to overcome these issues. It will certainly require a huge effort but I am sure we can hope to restart as quickly as possible,"" he told Reuters. The company said it was working with authorities to restore power to the plant, which has been offline since late March. Vedanta has previously denied that the smelter has been responsible for air and water pollution. Shares in Vedanta, which is controlled by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal, fell sharply on Wednesday following the deaths, and on Friday ended the day 0.5% lower at 728p, valuing the company at about £2bn.",John McDonnell has called for mining firm Vedanta to be delisted from the London Stock Exchange after 13 people died in violent protests outside the firm's southern Indian copper smelter.
"""There's a worry that there's no buyers of bonds and that on any given day everyone might want to sell,"" he said. The past few months have seen a number of market watchers express concern about the $10tn corporate bond market. Corporate bonds allow companies to sell their debt to investors, and operate in a similar way to government bonds. In a speech last week, Mr Gilbert warned of the systemic risk of a run on the corporate bond market and called on the Bank of England and other central banks to act as ""buyers of last resort"". ""I think central banks should consider stepping into the corporate bond market and buying corporate bonds in a period of severe market dislocation,"" he told the Financial Times' City Network. He said that if the banks did this, it would ensure there was enough cash in the market to prevent a run on corporate bonds and ""widespread panic"" similar to the run on Northern Rock. On Monday, Mr Gilbert told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believed the Bank of England and other central banks ""should consider, and I know that they are considering, whether they should make sure that the market works in a reasonable manner to stop a run on bond funds"". Corporate bonds have enjoyed a successful period as investors moved their savings into them in the hope of achieving better returns given the fall in global interest rates following the financial crisis. However, there are now concerns that as interest rates start to rise, investors will return to more traditional savings vehicles and leave the corporate bond market, leading to a liquidity crisis. Mr Gilbert told Today that while he did not think a crisis in the bond market similar to that which occurred in the aftermath of the financial crisis was likely, he did fear there was not ""going to be enough liquidity in the market when interest rates start to go up"". His comments came as Aberdeen Asset Management reported a 12.6% fall in assets under management to £283.7bn in the 12 months to the end of September. Pre-tax profit dipped slightly to £353.7m from £354.6m last year. The company has been hit by investors pulling their money out of its emerging market funds.","A lack of buyers could lead to a crisis in the corporate bond market, the head of Aberdeen Asset Management, Martin Gilbert has told the BBC."
"Robert PestonEconomics editor That's why Sir Andrew Witty and his senior colleagues were blissfully unaware that criminal acts were allegedly being committed to generate more than £750m a year of annual sales in China of pharmaceuticals and vaccines - or so he said. But Sir Andrew added that he believed Glaxo's worldwide control systems were excellent. Which is a slightly odd thing to claim, perhaps, given that the Chinese authorities have said that £320m was involved in the supposed crime. Even if the accused Chinese executives committed illegal acts in their own time and using their own computers, £320m is a lot of money to go walkies. Surely monitoring systems that GSK thinks of as robust would have detected misuse of funds on that scale - unless the monitoring systems are Nelsonian in their sightedness. But perhaps the scale of the crime isn't quite as much as that. My sources in GSK seem to believe the money involved may ultimately turn out to be millions of pounds, not hundreds of millions of pounds. That said, the Chinese authorities appear all of a sudden to have got the collywobbles about all the media and public interest in what transpired at Glaxo - in the sense that dissemination over the internet of facts and chat about the putative scandal seems to have been shut down. Having been tipped off that the Chinese censors appeared to be active, I asked my Beijing colleague Martin Patience what was going on. This is what he told me: ""If you type GSK or Glaxo into Weibo, China's version of Twitter, it comes up with no results. When you use the country's biggest search engine - Baidu - it also turns up no results."" This is something of a change, since initially the Chinese media and social media was brimming with salacious detail about the case. Perhaps there is anxiety in the Chinese government that it might be a bit embarrassing if the identity of officials said to have received bungs were revealed. All that said, there are noises in the Chinese state media that GSK was not the only drug giant alleged to be greasing palms. Which would not be a surprise, since many of those I know who work in China repeatedly moan that it is hard to stay in business unless they routinely bribe officials. So one question is why the head-office executives of Glaxo, and perhaps other pharma multinationals, didn't suspect that big sales in China might imply big bungs. And there are two other things. First is that the Chinese government is trying to clean up its health service and get better deals on pharmaceuticals from all suppliers. So it may be that accusing Glaxo executives of bribery and fraud is a sprat to catch the bigger mackerel of a modernised, more efficient health service. Glaxo, in trying to clean up its Chinese business, is shouting as loudly as it can that it wants to change its business model in China to deliver a better deal to local people. Second, Sir Andrew - who is pretty smart and cute with the press - was surprisingly clumsy when asked whether he would take a bonus this year. He said, truthfully, that it was impossible for the board to determine whether he should be penalised, till the Chinese authorities had uncovered more about what really happened in China. What he didn't do was volunteer a pay cut if it was demonstrated that an important part of this giant business behaved less than scrupulously on his watch.","In his first public pronouncements on allegations that GlaxoSmithKline executives bribed officials and doctors in China and may have defrauded GSK itself, the drug giant's chief executive said that any wrongdoing seemed to have taken place outside of the company's controls and processes."
"Easter egg sales have climbed £48m, soaring almost 50% to £153m compared with last year, according to figures from analysts Kantar. Meanwhile shoppers have already spent £37m on hot cross buns. M&S, Asda and Thorntons are among those reporting a big rise in demand. ""There are signs of people making a special, even symbolic, effort this year,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. ""Grandparents might be showing up with additional treats after 12 months of restrictions."" M&S said sales of its enlarged range of online Easter gifts are up 3,000%, while Easter egg sales are up 86%. Meanwhile an Asda spokesman said: ""We've seen many customers choosing to buy their Easter eggs early and buying more than they would normally - the average number of eggs bought ranging between three-five eggs per person. ""As a result, we're predicting sales of over 19 million Easter eggs together with 33 million individual hot cross buns as Brits prepare for what looks to be their biggest Easter yet."" Thorntons said it had seen 200% rise in sales online compared to 2019, before the pandemic began. It said consumers were purchasing ""extra special"" treats for loved ones, such as handcrafted Easter eggs, while ""more people than ever"" are using its icing service to share personal messages on eggs. Eating outdoors According to Kantar's survey, 61% of people are looking forward to socialising with friends again this Easter, and 23% of households are planning to dust off the barbecue over the weekend if the weather allows. Research from Sainsbury's published last week suggested three out of five people plan to host Easter lunch outside, while four out of five said if there was wet weather it would not stop them going ahead with their outdoor plans. Meanwhile more than half of households said they will swap an Easter roast for a less traditional lunch this weekend, to make the most of the rule of six, which allows families and friends to celebrate in their garden. A third are planning barbecues, according to Sainsbury's, while a quarter will order takeaways and a fifth will have picnics. Grocery sales slip Beyond the Easter boost, grocery sales rose 7.4% in the 12 weeks to 21 March compared with a year earlier, although that was a marked slowdown compared with previous months. In fact sales slipped 3% in the four weeks to 21 March compared with a year earlier. But that marked the first national lockdown when concerned shoppers stripped supermarket shelves bare at the start of the pandemic. ""This time last year, Brits were adjusting to schools and offices closing and making extra trips to the supermarket to fill their cupboards for lockdown,"" pointed out Mr McKevitt. ""To put that into context, shoppers made 117 million fewer trips to the supermarket this month compared with those fraught weeks in March 2020."" He said for the bigger picture it was important to look at the numbers in relation to two-year growth figures. ""While grocery growth has slowed against 2020, sales are still much higher than the same 12 weeks in 2019 - up by 15.6%,"" he said. ""As restrictions on dining out continue, the average household spent an extra £134 on take-home groceries compared with this period two years ago."" Supermarket performance Iceland saw the strongest growth during the period - excluding online-only Ocado - with a jump in sales of 14.3%. Aldi was the worst performer with growth of just 1.5% in the 12-week period. Tesco increased sales by 8.5% and gained share to capture 27.1% of the market, up by 0.3 percentage points year. Asda inched up its market share from 15.0% to 15.1%. Ocado's sales surge saw its growth climb 33.9%, but online grocery sales slowed in the past four weeks, with signs that shoppers are returning to physical stores. Kantar's figures suggest shoppers made 13 million additional trips to supermarkets this month compared with February. It said confidence had returned particularly among the over-65s, with the age group making 143,000 fewer online orders.","Consumers have been splashing out ahead of Easter as people prepare for weekend celebrations amid eased lockdown restrictions, research suggests."
"In his ruling on the temporary ban, the judge said Uber drivers didn't have official authorisation and accused the service of ""unfair competition"". The move follows a complaint by the Madrid Taxi Association. An Uber spokesman said the company was ""still operating"" in Spain. The Madrid taxi association has to raise a €10,000 down-payment before the ruling can come into effect. The BBC understands that Uber first heard of the hearing through media reports. The technology firm described the Spanish ruling - which could suspend the UberPop ride-sharing service across the country - as ""highly unusual"". ""UberPop is our ride-sharing solution and is about sharing the costs of vehicle ownership and helping people give up their cars,"" an Uber spokesman said, ""and we will continue to run the service"". ""This ruling is inconsistent with broad political acknowledgement in Spain and across the European Union on the benefits of sharing economy services. ""Uber will continue to comply with Spanish law and is currently assessing its legal options under this sudden and unusual proceeding,"" the spokesman added. Global restraints The Spanish order comes just a day after Uber was blacklisted in the Indian capital Delhi. Drivers ""lack the administrative authorisation to carry out the job, and the activity they carry out constitutes unfair competition,"" the Spanish court services said in a statement after the ruling. The company does not own cars or employ drivers, but connects customers and vehicles through its app, bringing what it says is much needed competition to the taxi industry. It is the latest blow for the San-Francisco based firm, which has faced strong opposition globally from some governments and established taxi firms, including London's ""black cab"" drivers. On Monday, Uber was banned by officials in Delhi after a driver allegedly raped a female passenger. On the same day, judges in The Netherlands banned its UberPop ride-sharing service, which was launched as a pilot project in Amsterdam between July and September and subsequently extended to The Hague and Rotterdam. ""Drivers who transport people for payment without a licence are breaking the law,"" said the decision from the Hague-based Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal. In a statement on Monday, Uber said it would ""continue to offer UberPop"", despite the threat of a fine of up to €100,000 for itself, and one of up to €40,000 for drivers. Uber has expanded rapidly since its 2009 launch and now operates in more than 250 cities across 50 countries. Earlier this month Uber was valued at $40bn (£25.5bn), following its latest round of fund raising.","A judge has ordered taxi booking service Uber to stop operating in Spain, after a series of protests by taxi associations."
"By Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent If you're anything like me, it's a lot. But imagine installing just one app that does almost everything - from buying a pizza, hailing a taxi, chatting to your friends and even booking a massage. It does exist and it's known as a super-app. There are two major players in the market and the most popular, with over a billion users, is WeChat. Created in 2011 by Chinese tech giant Tencent, WeChat started life as a messaging platform. It is now estimated to offer more than one million services through mini programmes, which are apps created by third-party companies and accessible through WeChat. That means you never have to leave WeChat's virtual universe (except perhaps to go to the bathroom). Most of these services are only available to users in China, which is why you may not have heard of it despite its dominance. The other main player is Ant Group's Alipay, which also has more than one billion users and offers 120,000 mini programmes. Business booms on WeChat Singapore-based Chinese entrepreneurs Angeline Liu and Angee Teng saw a unique opportunity to tap into WeChat's captive audience. ""WeChat is a part of our daily life that we [can't] live without,"" says Ms Liu, who spends two to three hours a day on the app. ""Basically everything you need is within this one app and every part of your life is touched [by it]."" Three years ago they launched a business selling premium meat to Chinese customers in Singapore. ""You can browse the products, make purchases, make payments and complete the whole cycle within this app,"" Ms Liu says. They don't advertise through traditional channels or social media yet business is booming, with tens of thousands of dollars worth of orders rolling in every month. Why is China so good at creating super-apps? China leapfrogged into the internet era, which means people went from telephones to smartphones pretty quickly. This allowed internet companies to innovate in a way their counterparts in the West haven't been able to. Rui Ma, who co-hosts the podcast Techbuzz, tells me it's also because data laws in China are quite different. ""In the West we have a lot of rules and regulations, creating a lot of friction around these services that in China the government simply hasn't gotten around to regulating,"" she says. That's not the only reason. ""Chinese internet companies think of building entire ecosystems, versus product-first or product-centric companies,"" she says. ""They're not just building a feature or one service. They're thinking about how to take the user's entire lifestyle and move it online."" A life lived online means a lot of transactions and a lot of data. Under Chinese law, all companies - not just WeChat - can be compelled to hand over that data to the ruling Communist Party. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) says it has found evidence of censorship on WeChat in China and warns this could also happen to overseas users. ""The risks associated with WeChat's lack of end-to-end encryption is that Tencent and WeChat can have access to any of your data on WeChat,"" says Audrey Fritz, who co-authored an ASPI report looking at the Communist Party's influence on Chinese internet firms. ""[They are] bound by [China's] cyber-security laws to give any data on WeChat or any of their apps to the government, if the Communist Party should request that."" Tencent told the BBC it complies with the laws and regulations of each market it operates in, adding that user privacy and data security are core values. ""User privacy and data security are core values at Tencent. We hold ourselves to the highest standards in protecting our users while ensuring we comply with all laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate,"" the company said. Concern over privacy and data security could be among the reasons it has been difficult for these Chinese apps to expand overseas. Throw in the fact that the domestic market in China is so big, there's really no need to go anywhere else. South East Asia a contender to produce the next super-app The race to build the world's next super-app is revving up and many of the frontrunners are based in South East Asia. With 600 million people spread across the region, there are already half a dozen companies vying for their attention. Grab, Gojek and the SEA Group are among the biggest and best funded. Chinese companies Alibaba and Tencent have invested in them, as have US firms including Facebook, Google and PayPal. Indonesian-based Gojek has grown from a motorcycle-hailing platform to an app offering car rides, payments and food delivery. Gojek co-chief executive Kevin Aluwi says the region is a natural fit for super-apps. ""Having to only download one single app is something that is probably uniquely appealing to a part of the world where, for most people, the first real experience of the internet happened on mobile."" Perhaps surprisingly for a company that calls itself a super-app, Mr Aluwi says Gojek isn't trying to monopolise its users' time. ""Many super-apps view their objective as to increase the amount of time that customers are actually viewing their app,"" he says. ""For us, we want our customers to get in, find the thing they need to solve their problem at that moment and then get out and get on with their lives.""",How many apps do you have on your phone?
"The influential forecasting group says this year's growth forecast is likely to be raised by 0.25-0.5% but that will not be matched by higher tax receipts. ""The improvement in the public finances is in danger of not just stalling but going into reverse,"" EY says. As a result, EY says Mr Osborne has ""very limited room for manoeuvre"". The EY Item Club says the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is likely to increase its 2.7% GDP growth forecast for this year by 0.25-0.50%. The OBR's prediction now trails that of many other forecasters which have upgraded their outlook for growth to reflect the strengthening UK economy. The International Monetary Fund is predicting 3.2% growth this year, the Bank of England 3.5% and the CBI 3%. Weak EY says that combined revenues from income tax, national insurance contributions and capital gains tax are expected to fall almost £9bn short of the OBR's March forecast in 2014-15. Despite record levels of employment, income tax receipts have been weaker than expected, possibly because many new jobs are part time and low paid. A slowing housing market has also meant a tailing off of income from stamp duty. The forecast for Public Sector Net Borrowing (PSNB) for the same period is also expected to be revised up by £8bn to £95bn. 'Trumpet' EY also expects borrowing forecasts for future years to be revised upwards, predicting the chancellor will deliver a surplus a year later than he originally planned, in 2019-20. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, says: ""In recent Autumn Statements, the chancellor has been able to trumpet a series of upward revisions to the OBR's growth forecast as evidence that his economic plan is working. This time, that's where the good news is likely to end. ""The improvement in the public finances is in danger of not just stalling but going into reverse. With just five months to go it appears virtually impossible for the government to achieve the OBR's current forecast for borrowing in 2014-15."" Moderation Meanwhile, manufacturers' organisation the EEF says UK manufacturers have enjoyed a ""solid"" end to the year with positive figures on output and orders continuing to feed through into investment and job creation. But the manufacturing bosses' lobby group, whose report was put together with accountancy firm BDO, says manufacturers have moderated their outlook for growth next year. It says global uncertainty, especially the weak performance of the eurozone, is contributing to a more cautious outlook in the short term. The EEF's chief economist, Lee Hopley, said: ""Despite some uncertainty ahead, the fact companies are maintaining their investment and hiring plans shows they have some optimism about prospects ahead. The chancellor can do his bit to back these plans by ensuring the business environment for companies planning to invest, recruit and get into new markets is a target for further action on Wednesday [in the Autumn Statement].""",The EY Item Club is warning Chancellor George Osborne he will struggle to find any room for tax giveaways when he delivers this week's Autumn Statement.
"The US carmaker blamed the pandemic, which it said had amplified years of poor sales and ""significant losses"" in the region. About 5,000 people, mostly in Brazil, are expected to lose their jobs. The decision is part of a global restructuring by Ford as it tries to improve its financial performance. ""With more than a century in South America and Brazil, we know these are very difficult, but necessary, actions to create a healthy and sustainable business,"" said Ford chief executive Jim Farley. Before the Covid outbreak, Ford had announced plans to scale back in several markets, with closures in countries that included Brazil, the UK, France, Germany and Russia. It cut thousands more jobs last year amid a downturn in car sales due to the pandemic. 'Committed to the region' On Monday, Ford said it planned to stop operations at its Camaçari and Taubaté plants immediately, though some production of parts will continue for a few months to support inventories. The Taubaté factory, which opened in 1974 near São Paulo, made engines, while Camaçari, which opened in 2001, produced cars such as the Ka Hatch. The Troller plant in Horizonte, in the north-eastern state of Ceará, which makes off-road vehicles, is due to shut in the fourth quarter of 2021. Ford said it expected the wind-down to cost $4.1bn, including separation payments, and was working to find buyers for the plants. The firm, which opened its first assembly plant in Brazil in 1920, later expanding to full-blown manufacturing, will retain some presence in the country, including a regional headquarters in São Paulo. ""I want to emphasize that we are committed to the region for the long term and will continue to offer customers full sales, service and warranty support,"" said Lyle Watters, president of Ford South America and the company's International Markets Group. Research firm IHS Markit estimates that global car sales dropped about 15% in 2020. In Brazil, sales dropped 26% and are not expected to recover for at least two years, Ford said.","Ford has said it is closing its last three factories in Brazil, putting an end to decades of manufacturing presence in the country."
"Lord Davies, Britain's former trade minister, said women now accounted for 20.7% of board members in the FTSE 100 firms, up from 12.5% in 2011. He wants women to occupy a quarter of all board positions by 2015. The report also said there was a ""growing recognition"" of the benefits of equality to business. Eyes on Britain The social and economic benefits of having more women on boards were also increasingly appreciated, Lord Davies' review found. He said: ""The rate of change that we have seen at the heart of our biggest companies over the last three years has been impressive. ""The voluntary approach is working and companies have got the message that better balanced boards bring real business benefits. ""We are finally seeing a culture change taking place at the heart of British business."" But he said the ""eyes of the world"" were on Britain, and the UK needed to prove it could promote equality on a voluntary basis, not by regulation. Businesses are coming round to having women on boards, Newton Investment Management chief executive Helena Morrissey told the BBC. ""Mysteriously, the chairmen often say that the men behave better when the women are around,"" she said. ""Really the arguments are that you need diversity of thought, diversity of perspective,"" she added. ""This has moved away from being politically correct, this is a move to being regarded as good business sense."" Bosses of tomorrow Lord Davies published a review in 2011 called 'Women on Boards'. He said ""real progress"" had been made in the intervening years, with ""more women than ever before"" in top positions. Business Secretary Vince Cable said the figures showed businesses were getting the right mix of talent ""around their boardroom table"". He said: ""98 of the FTSE 100 boards are now made up of at least one woman and we need fewer than 50 new women appointments to FTSE 100 boards to reach our target of 25% of women on all FTSE 100 boards in the next year. ""This is a huge improvement from where we started just three years ago."" 'Core issue' Mr Cable called for a ""renewed, concentrated effort"" by company chairs and chief executives to ""change the make up"" of their ""top table"". He added: ""More needs to be done to improve the number of women in executive positions. ""These will be the CEOs of tomorrow and businesses still aren't tapping into the vast talent pool available to them."" Shadow minister for women and equalities Gloria De Piero said the UK was making ""decent progress"" but it was a ""bit early to be celebrating"" as women represented 50% of the population. She said a lack of diversity led to poorer company performance and that Labour would consider introducing quotas if progress was not made. Ms De Piero added: ""But there's also a role for government to play in setting the right example to business. ""With just five women out of 33 in the cabinet, and women only making up 20% of government ministers, David Cameron and Nick Clegg have shut women's voices out of their own top table."" Maria Miller, minister for women and equalities, said: ""The workplace was designed by men for men. Women do not need special treatment, they just need a modernised workplace that gives them a level playing field."" She said supporting women to fulfil their potential should be a ""core business issue"" for the ""long term sustainability of our economy"".","The boardrooms of top UK companies have undergone a ""culture change"", with a growing number of women in decision-making roles, a report has said."
"By Dan AscherBusiness Reporter But for business leaders, many of whom lobbied against Brexit, the pledge means that they will soon have to adapt to a more distant relationship with the UK's largest trading partner. Analysis suggests that new trade deals further afield are unlikely to compensate for the economic impact of this shift. And on top of that comes a plan to overhaul immigration policy that will affect how and who firms can recruit. So will the party of Brexit also manage to serve the needs of business? And what will firms be lobbying for? Brexit With an 80-seat majority, there is little doubt that Mr Johnson will be able to get his Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament, paving the way for the UK to leave the European Union. The prospect of an end to three years of to and fro over the issue is welcomed by the deputy director general of the CBI, Josh Hardie. ""Just the fact that we have a government with a strong majority and a mandate actually provides the opportunity to bring a bit more certainty,"" he said. But as the prime minister's opponents were at pains to point out during the election campaign, the UK could still leave the EU without a trade deal at the end of next year unless a trade deal with the EU can be struck in record time. Mr Hardie said British businesses would like see maximum alignment with the bloc, describing a relationship of frictionless trade very similar to EU membership, but the new government has promised an arms length arrangement, with the UK outside both the EU single market and the customs union. Mike Cherry, the national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said Brexit could provide an opportunity for British firms to expand into other overseas markets such as the US, Canada and Australia. But the UK's relationship with the EU remains the first item on the agenda. Infrastructure and investment Mr Johnson welcomed the election result with a promise to ""repay the trust"" of voters in the north of England who swung behind the Conservatives, many for the first time in their lives. There is an expectation that the previous Conservative government's Northern Powerhouse plans will get further backing. The Times has suggested the prime minister could be planning to pump as much as £80bn into projects in key northern seats in a bid to cement his new voters' support. But Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of the lobby group London First, also put in a bid for more schemes in the south of England - if the prime minister has his wallet out anyway. ""The Conservative manifesto recognised the role for vital infrastructure in supporting the economy, from Northern Powerhouse Rail to gigabit broadband. ""The Government now should go further and give clear backing to HS2 and Crossrail 2, as well as reaffirming support for airport expansion at London's airports, putting in place the key building blocks needed to enable our regions to grow together."" That kind of spending may help boost the UK's flagging growth rates, says Yael Selfin, chief economist at accountancy firm KPMG. She says ""public spending will need to do the heavy lifting"" when it comes to dispelling the cloud of uncertainty around an EU deal but it will take more than that. ""The new government must also turn its attention to some of the longer standing challenges facing the UK, such as poor productivity and declining regional opportunities, to help secure a better long term future, while addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by new technology and climate change. Immigration Mr Johnson has pledged to introduce a points-based immigration system that would sort migrant workers into three categories. The first tier, entrepreneurs, investors and people who have won awards in certain fields, would receive fast-track entry under the system. Meanwhile, skilled workers, such as doctors, nurses and other health professionals, who have a confirmed job offer, would be placed in another category, with those eligible for an NHS visa also receiving fast-track entry and reduced fees. For low-skilled or unskilled workers, sector-specific rules would be put in place, enabling British firms to fill gaps where UK workers cannot be found. But the plans have come under fire from business leaders who have said the proposed policy is too vague and would affect their ability to plan for the future. The CBI's Mr Hardie said while a points-based system could work if designed to respond to the needs of the economy, but more detail would be welcome. Catherine McGuinness, policy chair at the City of London Corporation, the governing body of London's financial district, said Mr Johnson should bear in mind that services were ""the lifeblood"" of the UK economy but relied on ""attracting, retaining and developing high quality talent"". Business rates Boris Johnson has pledged to reform business rates, which have been blamed for tough times on the High Street, with well-known chains shutting stores across the country over the past few years. But that could take time, according to Mr Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses. Just a review of rates could take up to five years, he said. At present, business rates are based on the size of a firm's property as well as revenues, in most cases. But Mr Cherry said the tax was charged ""before you even turn over your first pound, let alone make any profit"". Mr Hardie from the CBI said the business rates system was ""fundamentally broken"" and urged ""radical reform"". For many firms, especially in the retail sector, reform of business rates, which they have been calling for for several years, remains the top priority.","Boris Johnson promised his government would ""unleash"" the potential of British business, once he has fulfilled his core campaign promise to ""get Brexit done""."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Attempts to steal cash have risen from 400 attacks in 2014 to 723 last year, according to a report by ATM operator Cardtronics. It said one in five incidents in Europe occurred in the UK. Thieves are generally unsuccessful, with 41% of cases resulting in cash being stolen. ""For the first time, we have proof that the wider damage caused by these attacks is far greater than the direct impact to cash machines or the building they are in. ATM attacks are not victimless crimes,"" said Tim Halford, managing director of Cardtronics UK and Ireland. The report suggested that nearly half of all attacks could be considered as dangerous, in that heavy force was used. This could include ram-raids and gas explosions to blast out the ATM. These ""dangerous"" attempted thefts have risen from an estimated 129 in 2014 to 342 in 2017. Last year, a seven-man gang that blew up cash machines across the UK, stealing hundreds of thousands of pounds, were handed jail sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. Would-be thieves in Liverpool blew up a cash machine but were unable to take any money from it on Monday. Other dramatic cases included raiders using gas to blow up a cash machine outside a Matalan store in Darlington last year. The report said industry data showed that in 2018 almost 70% of gas attacks on ATMs took place on petrol station forecourts, adding an extra level of potentially dangerous consequences. Community concern The report said that rural communities, where there are are already issues over access to cash, were being targeted. One in four attacks occurred in communities which had only one or no bank branch in the vicinity, it said. It could take more than four months for the ATM to reopen. Cardtronics is the largest operator of non-bank cash machines in the UK, and receives a fee from banks each time one is used. It run brands such as Cardzone and Bank Machine which operate on forecourts, It is one of the various operators closing ATMs. Network co-ordinator Link has said more than 250 free-to-use cash machines are disappearing a month as operators shut unprofitable ones. There are more than 50,000 free machines in the UK - but the number is shrinking at a record rate as people use less cash.",Thieves are increasingly trying to smash or blast their way into UK cash machines - with the number of attacks on ATMs nearly doubling in four years.
"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News Mr Bird will need to move out of his apartment soon as he can no longer afford the rent without a job. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June 1,778 firms said were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In June 2019, only 345 firms had plans to cut 24,000 jobs. The cuts came as coronavirus wiped more than a quarter off UK economic output. The figures give an insight into the surge of redundancies announced since coronavirus blighted the UK. Airbus, Royal Mail, the airport services group Swissport, HSBC, Centrica and the Restaurant Group, owner of Frankie and Benny's, were among the businesses to announce redundancy plans in June. Firms planning to make 20 or more staff redundant have to notify the government by filing a form called an HR1 Advance Notice of Redundancy. The number of these forms filed with the Insolvency Service shows a steep rise in the number of firms planning to cut staff. 'It's been really upsetting and stressful' William Bird, 27, had been working as an assistant producer at an events agency in London that creates tailored experiences for big brands. He was furloughed in April, and then at the end of June, he was told that he was being made redundant, after four years with the firm. ""Unfortunately, right now members of the public do not feel safe to attend events... so at the end of June, I was told that my company had done everything to try to retain me, but due to the lack of work coming in, they didn't have the financial backing to keep me on,"" he told the BBC. Mr Bird said it had been a ""difficult year in general"", as his mother passed away from cancer a few weeks into lockdown. ""It's been really upsetting and stressful. I've gone from having a tragedy in the family, to looking for work, and at the end of August I'm going to have to move out from the flat I rent in London with my girlfriend because we can't afford it anymore,"" he said. He says he only received three weeks' of redundancy pay as he was on rolling contracts during his first year with the firm. And he is upset that his month of notice in July was paid at the 80% furlough rate, rather than the full salary listed in his contract. The only consolation to the situation, says Mr Bird, is that his firm didn't want to let him go: ""They told me that this wasn't performance-based at all, and that they were making difficult decisions for the future of the company, with the hope that after the industry recovered, they'd love to offer me my job back."" The figures from May and June show a substantial increase from the same months the previous year, and from March and April, when the coronavirus lockdown began. Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies, said: ""I would expect it to be bigger in July and bigger again in August, because there was a wave of firms that announced redundancies in the first week of July and the first week of August. ""I think it is inevitable now that redundancy numbers will be higher than they were at the peak of the last recession in 2008."" Companies including WH Smith, Dyson, Dixons Carphone, John Lewis, and Casual Dining Group have all announced redundancies recently, and there has been a surge in requests for redundancy advice. Adding up the total number of dismissals planned shows a similar picture of stricken employers cutting staff. Though the June figure excludes information from 79 firms, which was not available when the numbers were compiled, it shows a steep rise in the number of positions being considered for redundancy. The total number of employers making redundancies will be higher than these figures, as firms making fewer than 20 posts redundant at any one ""establishment"" do not have to notify government. However, employers often end up making fewer redundancies than the original number they notify to the government. Consultation process The redundancy process takes time. It includes a consultation period of a minimum of 30 days for 20 staff and over, and 45 days for 100 or more staff. This helps to explain why official redundancy figures gathered by the Office for National Statistics do not yet show a significant rise. In Northern Ireland HR1 forms are filed with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. In response to the BBC's findings the Department for Work and Pensions pointed to the measures it has introduced to try to support those looking for work. ""Across the country our Plan for Jobs will give business the confidence to recruit and retain workers... and - through the Kickstart scheme - create hundreds of thousands of new, subsidised jobs for young people,"" a spokesperson said.","""It's been really upsetting and stressful,"" says Will Bird, an events producer who was recently made redundant."
"The Hong Kong airline has agreed flight attendants can choose to wear trousers, after intense union pressure. Some crew had complained that wearing short skirts had made them feel uncomfortable - especially when putting bags in overhead lockers or taking public transport to and from work. But change will not happen until Cathay next refreshes its staff uniforms. That could take three years, according to unions. ""We welcome and appreciate the company's decision on giving us an option in choosing uniforms,"" said Pauline Mak, vice chair of the Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Flight Attendants Association. 'Protection' The skirts-only rule has been in place since the airline was founded in 1946 - despite a growing backlash which appears to have gained even more momentum during the #MeToo movement. Flight attendants had requested a redesign of their workwear in 2014 - saying the skirts were too revealing and may provoke sexual harassment. Ms Mak said the policy change ""not only provides us one more option, but also provides us with protection"".

"Without expansion, the five airports will be full by 2034 because of higher demand for flights, according to the Department for Transport (DfT). It made the estimate as it extended the consultation period for expansion at Heathrow by two months. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the case for building a third runway at Heathrow was ""as strong as ever"". The new estimate on airport capacity will help to fuel calls for expansion at other airports in the South East. Gatwick reiterated its pledge on Tuesday to build a second runway regardless of what happened at Heathrow. The DfT has published a series of new reports into the impact of expanding the UK's biggest airport, including updated noise analysis and a new air quality plan. A consultation on the draft Airports National Policy Statement, which sets out the government's support for the Heathrow project, initially closed in May, but it has now been reopened until 19 December.","London's airports will hit full capacity six years sooner than expected, new government figures say."
"Japan has agreed to lower duties on Australian beef and raise the duty-free quota on cheese - Australia's biggest dairy export to Japan. Australia will cut tariffs on Japanese electronics, cars and white goods. The deal, agreed after seven years of negotiations, is expected to be finalised later this year when Japan's prime minister visits Australia. Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who is currently visiting Japan, called the pact a historic one. ""This is the first time that Japan has negotiated a comprehensive economic partnership agreement or free trade agreement with a major economy, particularly a major economy with a strong agricultural sector,"" Mr Abbott said. Broader deal The pact between the two countries comes as officials are trying to push for an ambitious US-led 12-nation free trade plan, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Negotiations between representatives of the various nations, which include Australia and Japan, hit a roadblock earlier this year. Differences on the issues of tariffs on imported goods, particularly between the US and Japan, were among the issues that were unresolved. Agricultural tariffs have become a sticking point for Japan, which is keen to protect its rice, wheat, beef and pork producers from outside competition. Some analysts suggested that the Australian and Japan deal may help spur progress on the TPP talks. Aurelia George Mulgan, a professor of Japanese politics at University of New South Wales said the bilateral deal means that ""Australia gets preferential treatment over the US."" She said that US would be under pressure to agree a deal that puts it ""on a level playing field with Australia"". ""Japan knows that America wants it on board, because TPP without Japan is not much worth all that much. Japan is playing hardball,"" she added. US President Barack Obama is scheduled to tour the region, including Japan, in the coming weeks and is expected to discuss the issue. 'Moderate recovery' Meanwhile, as expected, the Bank of Japan did not announce any new stimulus measures at the end of its two day meeting,, and said it was not expanding its bond buying programme. ""Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, albeit with some fluctuations due to the consumption tax hike,"" the Bank of Japan said in a statement. ""Private consumption and housing investment have remained resilient as a trend with improvement in the employment and income situation."" Tokyo's Nikkei stock market fell 1.4%, its biggest drop in two weeks, as exporter shares were hit by a continued stronger yen.",Japan and Australia have agreed a trade deal which will see them lower tariffs on imports of key products.
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter It said the forthcoming referendum on European Union membership and elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would cool the housing market. Rics said the Stamp Duty increases for landlords that came in on 1 April were another factor. The Halifax has also said that the EU vote is likely to slow the market. ""Elections inevitably bring with them periods of uncertainty in the market, and our figures would suggest that next May's devolved elections are no exception,"" said Simon Rubinsohn, Rics chief economist. ""Likewise, the EU referendum, is likely to be an influencer in terms of the damper outlook for London in particular."" 'Imbalance' The survey showed that most surveyors in London expect prices to fall over the next three months. The number of surveyors expecting a price fall outweighed those expecting a rise by 38%. However in other parts of the country, surveyors were much more optimistic. In north west England and in Northern Ireland most survey respondents expect prices to rise significantly over the spring and early summer. And in the longer term, Rics expects house prices to rise by more than 4% a year in England and Wales - whatever the results of the EU referendum and the elections. ""The imbalance between demand and supply will still exert a strong influence on the market, with house prices expected to rise by close to 25 per cent over the next five years,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. Recent estimates of house price inflation vary from 10.1% in the year to March by the Halifax - to 5.7% by the Nationwide.","UK house price inflation is set for a slowdown over the coming months, a survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) suggests."
"By Szu Ping ChanBusiness reporter Alongside the announcement, it also published its quarterly Inflation Report. In it, the Bank of England said that any future increases in the borrowing costs would be limited and gradual. Here are five things we learnt from the Bank's report. Homeowners shouldn't panic A third of British households have a mortgage on their home, but most are tied to deals that fix the interest rate on the loan. The Bank highlighted that many families have taken out these types of mortgages in recent years - nearly 60% of outstanding home loans are tied to a fixed-rate. It calculated that many households who currently have a fixed-rate mortgage will actually see a reduction in their payments when they remortgage because consumer borrowing costs have come down in recent years. For households who took out a five-year fixed-rate deal, the reduction is estimated to be significant - as much as 2 percentage points. For families who fixed the interest rate on their mortgage for two years, the Bank estimates that the rate they pay could fall by around 0.3 percentage points. The Bank also said interest rates paid on personal loans and credit cards were more likely to be fixed. While 59% of mortgages and 80% of personal loans and credit cards are tied to fixed rates, only 26% of savings accounts are. The Bank said this suggests ""a rise in Bank Rate may feed through to to effective saving rates more quickly than to borrowing rates on average"". Consumers can cope with credit Credit is now cheaper and more abundant than it was ten years ago. The average interest rate paid on a £10,000 personal loan is now 3.7%, compared with 7.8% a decade ago, while the average interest free period on a credit card balance transfer is now 28 months, compared with 8.2 months in 2007. Much has been made of the recent double-digit rise in consumer credit, which the Bank itself describes as ""rapid"". However, it noted that most borrowing in recent years had been among those who had never taken out a credit card or personal loan, while around 40% could pay back their loans tomorrow if their banks demanded because they have a savings cushion. Low growth is the new normal The Bank expects the UK economy to keep expanding at a steady pace over the next few years. However, it warned that productivity growth, a key barometer of UK living standards, had ""barely grown"" over the past decade, and was now unlikely to grow at the same rates as in the past. If the Bank is right, this means lower growth and weaker pay rises could be the new normal for the British economy. The Bank believes the UK economy will grow by 1.6% in 2017 and 2018, with growth edging up to just 1.7% by the start of the next decade. Tight wage growth v strong employment British consumers have felt a squeeze on their incomes this year as the fall in the value of the pound has push up prices for goods and services. The Bank still expects real incomes to fall this year, although average weekly pay packets are expected to grow at a slightly faster pace than expected three months ago. It expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI) to peak at 3.2% in October, before easing back gradually towards the Bank's 2% target. But there is also good news. The UK jobs market is expected to remain strong. The Bank believes unemployment is likely to fall further from its current four decade low of 4.3% to around 4.2% by the end of the year. Global demand will support the UK A ""significant"" pick-up in global economic growth is forecast by the Bank to support UK exports and business investment, even as Brexit uncertainties remain. It added that the weaker value of the pound had also boosted Britain's competitiveness. Business investment is now expected to grow by 2.5% this year, more than double its previous estimate of 1%. ""The combination of the stronger global economy and the low sterling exchange rate is supporting UK exports,"" the Bank said. While companies were investing in their businesses at a faster pace than the Bank expected a few months ago, it noted that investment growth was ""more modest than would have been expected given these conditions alone - probably as a result of the drag on companies' investment plans from the anticipation of and uncertainty around Brexit.""","As widely expected, the Bank of England raised the UK interest rate - to 0.5% from 0.25% - in the first increase in more than a decade."
"Alex, 29, is a venue manager of a gaming arcade and earns £25,000 a year. However, he has been placed on furlough since March. His partner Rebekah is an NHS nurse and has recently started maternity leave following the birth of their twin daughters, Eden and Indie, last week. They have two older boys, Rory, five and Casper, four. Over to Alex.... The day starts at 7:00 with the newborn twins needing a feed. They came home yesterday after being at the hospital for the past few days and are on a feeding plan to help them gain weight as they were born nearly five weeks early, which means they will need formula in addition to breast milk. We never intended to use formula as breast milk is a lot cheaper! But when it comes to health, there is no discussion needed. We've had a new Tesco open close by so I take a walk to see if the formula is in stock and how much it costs, whilst also taking the opportunity to use their coffee machine! They have the formula but it's slightly more expensive than our usual shop so I do not purchase it. I do pick up a coffee, a Red Bull, a couple of croissants for our other two children and some bacon for £7.85. 12:30. We have a visit from the community midwife to see the twins. Everything is ok and both gained some weight! Going to come back again in two days to make sure all ok. Rest of the day is spent tidying. Our house with six in has suddenly gotten a whole lot messier! The twins are settling in and getting used to the new noisier surroundings generated by their older brothers. I purchase the formula from Sainsbury's where it is £10.50. Total spend: £18.35 7:00. I check my bank account and see the direct debit for the gas and electricity has been taken today (£42.84). We're using slightly less than this so the account is now £5.86 in credit. Usually I would be at work now but being on furlough is a strange situation, I've never not been at work since turning 18. The time at home is great, even more so since the twins' arrival, but it does feel like something is missing, let alone £200 less in my pay. To help with this, we have taken the option of a mortgage holiday which is saving us £627 a month. 11:30. We take a walk to the park for a picnic with a detour to the shop for supplies (£19.95). I always make sure I scan my Nectar card app as my points balance is worth over £55. Hoping to have this close to £100 in time for Christmas. 16:00. I plan to laminate the hallway but when I start I realise I've lost my hammer. I rip out the old skirting board and clean up before going to buy a new one. It's Casper's birthday on Friday and Rebekah asks me to pick up some things for his party so with these, a new hammer, some other bits and a couple of new t-shirts, I've spent £54.81. When I return I tell her to never send me shopping again on my own, I always seem to buy more than intended! Total spend: £117.60 11:00. The community midwife arrives and Indie has gained a lot of weight but Eden is still the same. We're advised to keep to the feeding plan and she will return to check again on Friday. 13:30. During lockdown, we decluttered and listed a few items on eBay. A Nintendo Wii sells for £36, so Rory and I take a walk to the post oﬃce. We nip into the shop ﬁrst for a drink and a sneaky chocolate bar (£2.10). I tell him that he's not to tell his brother or mum! Postage and packaging costs £14.49 and it's on its way to its new owners. 17:00. I'm informed I will be returning to work on 8 June. This is a surprise as I wasn't expecting to be back till July but the arcade I manage is being classed as a non-essential shop. I have mixed emotions, probably more so because of the surprise at being allowed to open. I pass the message on to my team who, reassuringly, respond with excitement. 17:30. I don't usually drink alcohol at home but seeing friends having drinks tempts me. £18.80 and a case of beers later and drinks for Rebekah and the boys, we're out in the garden. Total spend: £35.39 Total made: £36.00 10:00. I have a busy day planned today. I agreed to help my mum's partner by moving a load of mixed concrete for him from a wagon. When I finish, there's a KFC close by which doesn't look busy so I pop by and have a ﬁllet stacker meal which is £6.59. 16:00. On to the next job ﬁnishing the laminate ﬂooring at home. Some diﬃcult cuts to do round the stairs, doorway and piping but the job is complete and I'm happy with how it has turned out. 18:00. Need to pick up party food for Casper's birthday tomorrow. I can't remember the last time I ﬁlled the car up and it comes to £58.14, usually this would cost close to £70 every couple of weeks so love the low oil prices! Then to the supermarket where I spend £161.53 on food, tableware, party supplies and some tiny baby clothes as the girls are not ﬁtting their up to one-month outﬁts. I spend the rest of the evening building a go-kart whilst my partner wraps the presents we've been hiding in the wardrobe. Total spend: £226.26 It's party day! Casper is turning four today and what a strange time to be in! It would have been his ﬁrst real party with pre-school friends but sadly, not going to be the case. To try and make the day special, we found a bouncy castle company still operating and ordered one for the garden. 7:00. No surprise with the early start, the birthday boy jumps on to our bed super excited. Whilst this blog is about money, there is nothing quite as valuable as seeing that excited smile on your child's face. 8:00. The bouncy castle arrives and is inﬂated. They disinfect the castle prior to leaving and we pay them £55 for the day. The boys waste no time in jumping on! 11:00. The community midwife arrives to weigh the twins again. Both have put on weight, enough for no further additional visits, with the next being at 21 days. 11:30. So throughout the day, lots of text messages and phone calls arranging times for visitors to bring presents for Casper whilst complying with social distancing measures. Certainly a different type of party than we're used to. However all is worth it, especially when the birthday boy says it's the best birthday ever. 20:00. After a tiring day, a Chinese has been ordered (21.80). No way either of us are cooking tonight. Total spend: £76.80 My Money More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: 12:15. As I am soon returning to work, I draft up some rotas ready for the reopening. It will be strange going back after so long and still so many questions. Will we be busy? How will customers react to the changes? And most importantly, will my team and myself stay safe? 13:30. A further DIY task, today the glamorous job of sealing a toilet base. Two young boys tend to ""miss"". However, all doesn't go to plan as one of the screws is damaged. After an hour of trying to remove, I begrudgingly order a screw extractor and some screws for click and collect which comes to £11.57. Get home but still no luck. I clean as much of the area and scrub underneath as much as I can then seal the base. Disappointed at a job half done and wasted money. 18:30. The day is wrapped up with a conference call to discuss fundraising ideas for Lutterworth Town FC, who I am the club secretary for, and a night on the sofa in front of the telly. Total spend: £11.57 A quick look at today's forecast, another hot day on the cards so we decide to have a barbecue. 12:30. Off to the supermarket to pick up some coal, drinks and food to cook and prepare. £43.60 spent and plenty to enjoy. 14:00. The BBQ is going well, sun is shining and the boys are playing nicely together and the girls have been sleeping most of the time. 20:00. So after a relaxing chilled out day, me and Rebekah talk about the crazy week we've had. This coming week we need to decide what to do as we have the option of sending Rory back to school from 8 June. It seems like everything is going back to normal. Total spend: £43.60 Total spent this week: £493.57 How does Alex feel about his week? This week was by no means a normal week! Normally we would have done a weekly shop, maybe filled the car with fuel, made another couple of trips to the shop and spent around £150-£200. Being on furlough, and I'm sure others can relate, has left me a lot of newfound free time. I feel this has assisted in making the weekly spend creep up to help the days go by. I don't know how I would class myself with spending. On the one hand, I always look for the cheapest deals and have no problem in not buying something there and then because it's the easy option. But on the other hand, I do tend to put a few non-essential items in the basket. This My Money exercise has certainly opened my eyes to what I actually do spend. However, despite spending almost double on our usual week, this week has created memories to last a lifetime and you just can't put a price on that!

"By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC News In the past few years, Uber has turned the process of booking a taxi on its head in many cities around the world. A mobile phone app, it allows you to check for cars in your area, book one with a click, and have it charged - usually at a cheaper price than a traditional taxi - to your credit card. But while Uber's user numbers have soared, it's far from universally welcome. In Paris, Uber has already had to withdraw the cheapest service it provides, after violent attacks on some of its drivers earlier this year. And last week two of the company's senior executives were hauled before a French court, accused of deceptive commercial practices and complicity in illegal activities. In Amsterdam, Uber's European headquarters was raided as part of a criminal investigation into whether the company is offering illegal taxi services. And in the last few days London's transport authority has proposed regulations that, if implemented, could seriously undermine the way Uber operates in the UK capital. The list of travails goes on and on. Uber has seen its services banned around the world in cities from Seoul, and New Delhi, to next year's Olympic hosts Rio de Janeiro. On top of all that, the European Commission is examining whether Uber is violating competition rules, and the European Court of Justice is deciding whether it's a transport company or a digital service, which could prompt changes to how it operates. Meanwhile, a court on Monday in London is due to decide whether the app used to track the driver's route is a taximeter or not, a definition, which again, will determine the path ahead. Plenty of fight It makes you wonder that Uber isn't thinking of innovating a cut-price legal service for its own purposes, as it doggedly argues its corner on point after point. A company with less self-belief and shallower pockets might be deterred by all this. What is Uber? But Uber is famous for its shoot first, argue later approach, and accustomed to brazening out criticism. The company started out with a small investment by its original founders, Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick, who is now the company's chief executive, and has since raised billions of dollars in venture capital from the likes of Baidu, Google and Goldman Sachs. Now, with a market valuation of $50bn (£33bn), the firm has good reason to feel invincible. Stuart Miles, founder of the tech media website, Pocket Lint, says it would take a lot to derail Uber's ambitious plans. ""They have enough fight in them, enough resources to keep pushing and pushing, because they have so much money,"" he says. ""Their ultimate goal is [that consumers think] - why would you need a car in a city when there's always an Uber a few feet away? They want to stop people buying cars altogether."" London rules But that vision is some way off. In the meantime the terrain ahead is rough. Following a sharp rise in the numbers of cabs crowding London roads, Mayor Boris Johnson has been calling for a cap on the numbers. Yet Uber can only work if there are plenty of its cars available at all times. All the candidates to replace him as mayor, from Sian Berry of the Greens, to Labour's Sadiq Khan, and Mr Johnson's fellow conservative Zac Goldsmith, agree there's a need to curtail the city's taxi free-for-all. And Transport for London's new proposals, including rules that would mean all cab bookings must be confirmed five minutes before pick up, and would ban the visualisation on the app of available cabs for current hire, are a direct challenge to the company's business model. TfL says all it wants to do is raise standards across the industry, ensuring drivers are properly insured and their rights protected. And make sure the system is resilient to illegal touting, and unregistered drivers masquerading as licensed cabbies. Gareth Mead, Uber Europe's spokesperson, says the proposals reflect resistance to change, and vested interests from the black cab industry, and aren't in consumers' interests. But he is undaunted. ""If these regulations were imposed, clearly we'd have to find a way to adapt, and we're very confident in our ability to do so,"" he says. ""On a European level there's movement to help define this market, put parameters in that would give us, and the public, clear certainty of how to operate. There is a momentum and it's something that is taking time, but the future is a positive one."" A Luddite solution? Uber users are not impressed either. Since the TfL proposals were published customers have taken to Twitter to demand their service be left alone. More than 120,000 disgruntled users have signed a petition. And the Institute of Directors boss, Simon Walker, called the measures ""a Luddite solution to a problem that doesn't exist"", warning they would ""damage London's reputation for innovation"". Uber's critics say the company has set up a model which circumvents rules protecting both employees and customers. There's concern that Uber's service amounts to predatory pricing, designed to drive out the competition, and that the company is sidestepping corporation tax by routing business through the Netherlands. One of the main sticking points across Europe is that some Uber services, rather than providing cars with licensed professional drivers, send you an ordinary car owner - often students or part-time workers with no specific qualifications - who add a bit of cab-driving in to their normal day. Time for change Few people would argue that Uber should be blocked altogether however. ""We'd all be driving horse-drawn hansom cabs if we didn't move on,"" says Professor Tony Travers of the London School of Economics. Even if legal challenges delay Uber's rollout he believes the change is inevitable. ""The truth is, one way or another, these changes will happen because younger, more affluent service buyers are not going to accept not changing their lives, just as tech has changed their lives in other ways."" In the meantime, the delays provided by drawn-out legal challenges do at least allow traditional taxi services to look hard at their own services and see if they can adapt in turn to the lessons Uber is forcing on them.","What's the future for Uber? As the controversial car-sharing service becomes increasingly popular with consumers, regulators seem to be busy putting up roadblocks. So will that put the brakes on the company's expansion?"
"Official figures showed sales rose 1.4% from October, despite economists' forecasts of about a 0.3% gain. But for the three months to November, which smoothes out monthly volatility, sales growth was 0.4% on the previous quarter, the slowest rate since April. Several retailers have warned of tough trading this winter. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley said November was ""unbelievably bad"", while Superdry and online retailer Asos have also warned of dismal trading. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the changing nature of Black Friday sales promotions posed a challenge for the process of adjusting for seasonal variations. Household goods sales leapt by 5.3% on the month in November, the biggest increase since the end of 2013 and driven by an 11% increase in electrical appliances. Online sales as a proportion of all retailing exceeded 20% for the first time, the ONS said. Surveys from the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard have suggested that households were continuing to shop cautiously in November. However, recently consumers have seen the fastest growth in underlying pay growth since 2008, with inflation falling to a 20-month low of 2.3%, according to ONS figures released earlier this week. Thomas Pugh, UK Economist at Capital Economics, said the stronger spending could point to a weaker December, but that the longer term trend was more positive. He said: ""With inflation continuing to fall back... and pay growth on the up, there should be scope for consumer spending growth to gather some momentum further ahead. [The] big picture is that a continued acceleration in real earnings, assuming a Brexit deal is signed, should give household spending a boost next year."" Philipp Gutzwiller, head of retail at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking, said November data showed that ""online is now truly coming of age"". He added: ""More than perhaps any month before, the fact that overall sales rose in November was thanks to the relative success of Black Friday online compared with on the High Street."" The most recent high street and shopping centre footfall data for November, compiled by Springboard, showed the worst decline since the recession. Analysis: By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent It turns out Christmas came early - but may not have been quite the bumper gift that some retailers were anticipating. Black Friday is increasingly a fixture in the festive shopping calendar, shifting Christmas spending from December to November. The ONS, which produces the retail figures, smooth them out to allow for seasonal patterns, but their adjustment process may not have yet caught up with what is still quite a new phenomenon. So, the ""adjusted"" increase in the amount of goods sold between October and November may appear stronger than it should. And it's clear that shifting more goods in November came at a heavy price for retailers such as Asos, which had to discount heavily to keep up with competitors, damaging profits. Beyond the November headline, the underlying trend in spending is slowing - growing by 0.4% over the last four months. That's the weakest rate since April, and doesn't bode well for retailers or the economy as a whole. And if Christmas shopping is happening earlier, December could disappoint. Indeed, a survey from CBI points to weakest growth in sales this month for over a year.","Retail sales jumped more than expected in November, helped by Black Friday promotions and stronger growth in sales of household goods."
"Spire, which is owned by private equity firm Cinven, operates 39 hospitals and 13 clinics across England, Wales and Scotland. The flotation is expected to take place in July. The group hopes to raise £315m and will use the money to reduce its debts. Spire was founded in 2007 following the acquisition and rebranding of 25 hospitals from Bupa. Last year, Spire reported revenues of £764.5m and earnings of £209m. Rob Roger, Spire chief executive, said: ""We have already invested £509m in our hospital estate over the last seven years and have ambitions to grow and invest further. ""Bringing Spire to the public markets will enable us to access capital, if required, to realise our growth strategy, thereby providing more patients with access to our services."" Flotation frenzy The flotation will be the latest in a line stock market debuts since the beginning of the year. In the first five months of 2014, 67 companies raised £13.6bn, according to market data firm S&P Capital IQ, up from £3.6bn in the same period last year. On Monday, motoring group the AA launched on the London Stock Exchange, while last week Lloyds Banking Group floated a 35% stake in its TSB business on the stock market. However, shares in some of the companies floated on the market - including AO World, Pets at Home, Saga and Just Eat - are now trading below their original listing price. In addition, clothing retailer Fat Face and budget airline Wizz Air scrapped their plans for share listings. Fat Face cited poor market conditions as the main reason for cancelling its plans to float. Easyhotel The Spire flotation announcement came as budget hotel group Easyhotel announced details of its listing on London's junior market - the Alternative Investment Market. The firm has priced its shares at 80p each, valuing the company at £50m. Easyhotel will float on 30 June and said it expected to raise £30m from the share sale, which would allow it to invest in expanding its hotel chain. Easyhotel's founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, said the stock market float would also allow him to step back from the company, although added he expected to ""remain a significant and supportive shareholder for a very long time"".","The UK's second largest private hospital chain, Spire Healthcare, has announced plans to list on the London Stock Exchange in a float expected to value the group at about £1bn."
"Robert PestonEconomics editor But Mr Flowers, who stepped down as chairman of the Co-operative Bank and vice chairman (no pun intended) of the Co-operative Group in June this year, was no ordinary banker. He is a ""superintendent"" Methodist minister and a trustee for Methodist Church Purposes, inter alia, and a Labour party politician in local government. Mr Flowers has been a serial local councillor, first trying to stand for the council in Coventry, and becoming a councillor first in Rochdale and then latterly in Bradford. What he also did was join the political wing of the Co-operative Group, where over a period of years he got himself elected first to an area committee, then a regional board and finally the national board. Those who know him say he is clever, persuasive and forceful. On the Methodist church's website, he describes himself as ""known for an objective rigour and for asking the questions others might avoid"". As a skilled politician, his rise and rise through the ranks of the co-operative movement was not, colleagues say, terribly challenging for him. Now you may notice that nowhere in this description of his career is there any sign that he has worked in banking in any senior capacity (or indeed, in any capacity at all). At various times he chaired the drug abuse charity Lifeline (or so the Manchester Evening News reported in 2010), was a member of the Advertising Standards Authority and was vice chair of the National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux. All of which are a long way from the world of credit risk and deposit protection. So how on earth did he end up on 29 March 2010 becoming chairman of the Co-operative Bank - a bank with £50bn of assets, £36bn of customer deposits and 4.7 million customers? Well it stemmed from a power struggle within the co-operative movement, after United Co-operatives merged with the Co-operative Group in 2007 - or so I am told. Remember that his appointment coincided with the most challenging time in the bank's history. The previous year it trebled in size by merging with the Britannia Building Society, to create what Co-op and the Britannia styled a super mutual. This merger turned out, as we now know, to be something of a disaster, in that losses on loans made by Britannia and the costs of writing off an expensive IT project have taken the bank to the brink of collapse - and Co-op is in the throes, as we speak, of securing agreement from creditors for its rescue deal. His appointment also came more than two years after the worst British banking crisis since at least 1913 and probably ever, and after those who ran the regulator, the Financial Services Authority, had pledged they would take extra care to make sure that those appointed to chair banks had appropriate skills and knowledge. So how and why did the FSA approve the appointment of Mr Flowers? As it happens, I am told that Flowers's political rivals within the cooperative movement were surprised and disappointed that his appointment was approved by the FSA - which has now been broken up, and replaced by the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority and the separate Financial Conduct Authority. What on earth did the FSA ask Flowers when they interviewed him to sanction his appointment? When earlier this month he gave evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, he seemed to have no grasp of the magnitude of the bank's asset, or its loans and investments - which as the committee chairman, Andrew Tyrie, pointed out, is pretty basic stuff. And the FSA's seemingly lackadaisical approach to his appointment was - many would say - compounded, by the fact that it allowed Co-op Bank for months on Mr Flowers' watch to negotiate another huge deal, to treble in size by buying more than 600 branches from Lloyds (a deal from which Co-op ultimately withdrew, when it belatedly recognised it was beyond its management capabilities). There's another thing too. A few weeks ago, the Treasury Select Committee was told by Neville Richardson, the former boss of Britannia who was chief executive of Co-op Bank when Mr Flowers was chairman, that he quit as the bank's CEO in the summer of 2011 because he believed it was being forced by its owner, Co-op Group, to bite off more than it could chew, with assorted reorganisation and expansion plans. Normally when a bank boss quits, the regulator would immediately interrogate him, to find out if it's a sign of something going wrong at the bank. But we still don't know if the FSA did interrogate Richardson then and what it learned. What we do know is that it was not till the end of 2012 that alarm bells began to properly ring at the regulator about what was going on at Co-op Bank - but even then it did not really get a grip till the spring of this year. Better late than never, many would say. And although investors in the bank's bonds are incurring losses of many hundreds of million pounds, the rescue of Co-op Bank won't involve a contribution from taxpayers (although even a few weeks ago, that was by no means certain). That said, and to state the bloomin' obvious, regulators at the defunct FSA and its successor body, the PRA, have a few questions to answer, about why they gave the thumbs up to Mr Flowers. There's also an important governance issue for the Co-op Group, about whether it is really appropriate for those who rise up through the political side of the co-operative movement to be able to exercise significant influence over its commercial activities. At the bank, of course, the stable door was closed after the horse was long gone. Mr Flowers was replaced as Co-op Bank chairman by a proper banker, Richard Pym. PS. I am told Mr Flowers used his platform as Co-op chairman to increase his influence with senior members of the Labour Party. He was on a finance and industry advisory group set up by the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. Update 16:20 I have learned a bit more about the checks that the Financial Services Authority carried out on Paul Flowers before authorising him to be a non-executive director of Co-op Bank and then the bank's chairman. Because a non-executive post at a large bank such as the Co-op Bank was deemed by the FSA to have ""significant influence"", I am told Mr Flowers was subjected to a ""rigorous interview"" in 2009, when first becoming a non-exec. And he had another FSA interview when he became chairman in 2010 - although this was less rigorous, I am led to believe, because at the time the FSA did not regard the posts of chairman and non-executive director as massively different (it has since changed its tune on this, and would run a much more systematic and detailed vetting process when approving the appointment of a chairman today than it did then). Apparently Mr Flowers admitted to the FSA that he did not have applicable experience in the financial services industry. But the FSA felt that Co-op Bank could compensate for this shortcoming, by appointing two deputy chairmen, who were also the senior independent directors (or SIDs) - which duly happened. That said the FSA did believe Mr Flowers's political skills would be useful in corralling a large and unwieldy Co-op Bank board. But does the FSA regret approving Mr Flowers and would he get approval if he applied today? The FSA won't say. Update 16:35 The Co-op Group has told me: ""Given the serious and wide-ranging allegations, Co-op Group has started a fact-finding process to find any inappropriate behaviour and will take action accordingly."" And the board has also launched a ""root and branch review of the democratic structure of the organisation, because we need to modernise to make sure the interests of all members are properly represented in the oversight of business activities"". In other words, the new management of Co-op Group is concerned to reform a governance system that allowed a small number of activists in the political wing of Co-op Group to control the group's commercial activities.",I spent a bit of time yesterday trying to find out a bit more about the Reverend Paul Flowers - because it is not every day that a former bank chairman is caught on camera apparently trying to buy cocaine and crystal meth from the front of a car in Leeds.
"Barclays, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide, NatWest, Santander and Virgin Money have confirmed they will offer the savings product. It is aimed at helping first-time buyers save for a deposit and includes a government top-up. The industry has said the scheme should run alongside building more homes. House price calculator First-time buyers purchasing an owner-occupied home worth up to £250,000, or £450,000 in London, will be eligible for a Help to Buy Isa when it launches on 1 December. The monthly maximum contribution from savers into a Help to Buy Isa will be £200, following an initial deposit of up to £1,000, with the government adding £50 a month at the most. The accounts will run indefinitely once opened. But if someone accumulates £12,000 over that time, a maximum of £3,000 will be added by the taxpayer. Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that a typical first-time buyer faces paying 5.1% more for a property than they did a year ago. The average price paid for a starter home in May was £211,000. Data from the Council of Mortgage Lenders showed that the typical first-time buyer needed a deposit of 18.6% in May. Earlier in the week, accountancy firm PwC predicted more than half of the under-40s would be renting homes from private landlords in the UK in 10 years' time.",Some of the banks and building societies participating in the government's Help to Buy Isa scheme have been named.
"By Karen HogganBusiness reporter James Daunt, the chain's chief executive since 2011, will remain in the post under the new ownership, along with his key management team. Mr Daunt said the sale should mean the chain could grow a lot faster. Waterstones has 283 bookshops and 3,000 staff in the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium, and sales of more than £400m a year. Lynwood Investments, which has been the controlling shareholder in Waterstones since 2011, will keep a minority stake. Lynwood boss, Marina Groenberg, said she was ""very proud that the business has been restored to profitability and good health during our ownership and thank James Daunt and the wider management team for delivering a successful turnaround"". New chapter Hedge fund Elliott has about £35bn of funds under management worldwide. It has earned a reputation over 40 years as a no-holds-barred activist investor. The firm famously pursued Argentine debt for more than a decade, seizing one of the country's naval ships while it was docked in Ghana and prompting the country to default. More recently it bought a 6% stake in Whitbread. Elliott wanted Whitbread to split its coffee chain from its hotel business to improve shareholder value, and this week Whitbread announced plans to do just that. However, Mr Daunt told the BBC that Elliott was buying Waterstones as an investment which would grow, not in order to force through change. He said he expected Elliott to ""see us grow and ultimately sell us for a nice profit - that's what private equity people do"". Mr Daunt said Waterstones was opening more shops at the moment, because the retail downturn was leaving empty space in desirable locations which the book chain could snap up. Normally Waterstones aims to open about 10 shops a year. However, investment from Elliott combined with greater availability of store space meant he expected the chain to open ""a lot more now"". Waterstones timeline 'Leaner and more flexible' Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said that back in 2008 the ""writing was on the wall for Waterstones"". The shift to online and the impact of rivals like Amazon meant they had been operating in a part of the market under ""significant pressure"". ""In the last few years they've managed to turn around the business through the good work that James Daunt has put into it,"" he said.

Mr Lim said Waterstones had attracted a buyer because the chain had ""come out the other end much leaner and more flexible"" and was now a profitable business.",Book chain Waterstones has been bought by activist investment firm Elliott Advisors for an undisclosed amount.
"According to the regulator Ofgem, British Gas charged customers its more expensive standard variable tariff rate after they decided to switch to a new supplier, due to a system error. British Gas also wrongly charged exit fees to 1,698 fixed deal customers. It also wrongly informed 2.5 million customers they might incur an exit fee. British Gas said following the system error, those who were charged too much were ""promptly refunded as soon as we identified the issue and were paid an additional goodwill gesture"". It said some customers were provided with initial communications containing incorrect terms and conditions - but all other communications they received were correct. ""We have changed our processes to ensure the error has been corrected,"" it added. 'Customers deterred' Anthony Pygram, director of conduct and enforcement at Ofgem, said: ""British Gas failed its customers who were coming to the end of their fixed contracts and switched supplier by unfairly penalising them and applying charges in error. ""Many more customers could have been deterred from getting a better deal due to the incorrect terms and conditions."" Those customers who were switched to a more expensive British Gas standard variable rate tariff, after they decided to switch to a new supplier, were overcharged by a total of £782,450, according to Ofgem. Meanwhile, the total of the incorrect exit fees charged to the 1,698 affected fixed deal customers totalled £64,968. Ofgem's investigation found that British Gas had provided 2.5 million customers with incorrect terms and conditions, which stated that exit fees were payable during the 49 day period before their fixed deals expired. Under industry conditions, a customer is generally entitled to switch at any time during or after this ""switching window"" without having to pay an exit fee. Ofgem said this switching window was designed to encourage customers to switch to a better deal before they were rolled onto a default tariff at the end of their contract. Redress fund The regulator opened an investigation in July 2017 following concerns raised by website MoneySavingExpert.com. Before the investigation had been completed, British Gas refunded in full all customers who had been overcharged by more than £1 and paid £502,633 in compensation to them. Following Ofgem's findings, British Gas agreed to pay a further £244,770 in compensation to customers wrongly charged exit fees, and also paid £1,050,229 into Ofgem's consumer redress fund. The redress scheme is a pot of money open to charitable organisations that support energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales. Charities can apply for cash to carry out schemes such as making homes more energy efficient. Energy firms can pay into the fund in lieu of, or in addition to, a financial penalty for breaches of their licence conditions.","British Gas has paid £2.65m in refunds, compensation and redress after wrongly overcharging more than 94,000 customers who switched to new providers."
"By Neil KoenigSeries Producer, The Life of Luxury And now there's another extreme machine aimed at the moneyed motor-mad: the EV2. ""It's a luxury, high-speed vehicle,"" explains one of its makers, Mike Howe. ""You hit a button and the gull-wing doors pop up just like a Lamborghini. Inside you have eight-way leather seats, reverse camera, cameras up top, state of the art tracks, state of the art suspension..."" In fact, according to Mike's twin brother Geoff, the EV2 is a ""luxurious tank"". That's because the machine has tracks like a tank, rather than wheels. The brothers claim that, thanks to its tracks, their vehicle can move at high speed across all kinds of rugged terrain in a similar fashion to its military counterpart - but unlike the latter, the EV2 is devoid of armaments. They say that there is demand for the product. However, the luxury market is a new departure for them, and a far cry from their normal line of business. 'Bigger, better' The brothers trace the origin of their enterprise (based in Maine, in the US) all the way back to their childhood. ""We were always pushing the envelope,"" recalls Geoff. ""We built our own log cabin because the other kids down the street had a tree house that their father helped build. Mike and I didn't have a father figure at the time. So we had to do it on our own. We wanted to make it bigger, better."" As time passed, they graduated from log cabins to unusual vehicles, such as off-road racers. In their college years, they converted a tour bus into a mobile stage for their rock and roll band. Later, they became obsessed with the idea of building an extremely fast, tracked vehicle. After years of work, they ended up creating a small tank, which they called the Ripsaw. The device caught the attention of the US Army, which eventually ordered manned and unmanned versions for research and development. As a result of the US military's interest, the brothers were able to turn their hobby into a business. The challenges they faced in creating the Ripsaw were formidable. For example, the faster you try to make a tracked vehicle go, the more likely you are to lose a track. ""It's like a wheel coming off on a car,"" explains Mike. Engineering problems like these proved tough to solve. The brothers looked beyond the automotive world for answers, and took lessons from elsewhere, such as from the technology employed in chainsaws. Hollywood calls As they gained experience, they expanded their range to include products like robotic systems that could help to disable bombs, and the Ripchair, an extraordinary off-road wheelchair with tracks. Hollywood also began to take an interest, and the brothers' vehicles have appeared in several big-budget pictures, like GI Joe 2 and Mad Max: Fury Road. It was collaboration with the movie industry that led to a new direction for the business. One day, the brothers received a call from someone working for a wealthy individual who had seen one of their vehicles on screen, and wanted a bespoke leisure version of the Ripsaw. They were at first surprised by the request, but after careful consideration, they decided to give the idea a go. The result was the EV2. They find dealing with the luxury market a whole new challenge. ""There is a learning curve,"" explains Geoff. One of the biggest difficulties is establishing clear lines of communication. He is rarely able to talk directly to the end client - so it is vital to ensure that the customer's wishes are being met, rather than those of any intermediaries. The brothers have found that clients in this market are interested in a range of options. In addition to those already mentioned, they include a night vision and thermal imaging system, which displays images of the road ahead and around the vehicle. ""You can shut all the lights off at night and the vehicle is completely dark and you can run 60 miles an hour down the road and see everything you need to see to be able to drive safely,"" says Mike. He adds that it's up to the client to establish where and how the vehicle can be driven safely and legally. The high cost of EV2 (a typical model costs hundreds of thousands of dollars) presents another challenge. Because so much money is at stake, the brothers sometimes need to do some delicate checking on potential customers, to establish that they are able to afford the cost. They say they have enjoyed adding a ""luxury"" product to their portfolio - but they do not want it to end up skewing the direction of the whole business, which is why they see it forming only a small part of their range in future. This approach is wise, says author and consultant Peter York, who has advised many large luxury enterprises. ""If you start spending time on billionaires' private fantasies then there are immense opportunity costs. ""A technologically innovative business and a luxury business are very different,"" he says. 'Pushing the envelope' Still, the brothers are always open to new ideas, and for a special client, they will continue to push the envelope. At present they are working on a variant with 2,000 horsepower - nearly four times the power of a standard EV2. ""We have no idea how it's going to work out,"" says Mike Howe. ""We're riding that edge between what's physically possible and what's a dream.""","Some of the very rich like to go further than just displaying their wealth. They want things that few others can have, such as vehicles like an armour-plated SUV ."
"In the adverts, the banks also called for a peaceful resolution after more than two months of political unrest. Protests against an extradition bill have evolved into a pro-democracy movement, concerned about China's growing power in the region. Businesses, hit by the unrest, are also facing growing political pressure. ""We are deeply concerned about recent events in Hong Kong. We strongly condemn violence of any kind and the disruption caused to the communities in which our customers, staff and shareholders live,"" HSBC said in the advert. HSBC said maintaining the rule of law was ""essential to Hong Kong's unique status as an international financial centre"", adding ""they fully support the ambition to resolve the present situation peacefully"". The HSBC advert was published in Chinese in the Hong Kong Economic Times, Hong Kong Economic Journal, Sing Tao, Wen Wei Pao and Ta Kung Pao. Standard Chartered echoed the sentiment in its advert placed in three newspapers including Wen Wei Po, Ta Kung Pao and Sing Tao Daily. ""We strongly support 'one country, two systems', and support the SAR [Special Administrative Region] government in effectively maintaining social stability and safety,"" the advert said. So far, banks have remained relatively muted on the politically-charged Hong Kong protests. In June, some banks said they had closed some branches due to disruption. Businesses under pressure Protestors in Hong Kong are fighting against what they see as a growing encroachment by China. Businesses have come under mounting pressure as the political unrest has intensified. That pressure culminated in the resignation of Cathay Pacific's chief executive last week, after the Hong Kong flag-carrier became embroiled in a controversy surrounding the protests. Several global brands including Versace, Sarowski and Coach have recently apologised to China for their representation of Chinese territories on their official websites or brand T-shirts. The situation is increasingly worrying business and financial communities, which have long considered Hong Kong an attractive place to do business. Hong Kong, home to Asia's third-largest stock market, is one of Asia's most important financial hub.",HSBC and Standard Chartered have taken out newspaper adverts in Hong Kong condemning the violence in the Asian financial hub.
"The legal amendment would give it a ""significantly enhanced"" role in regulating the lucrative market. London currently processes most of the trade in this financial sector, providing thousands of jobs. The ECB's proposal comes shortly after the European Commission published a draft law to give it the power to move euro clearing business out of London. Clearing is where a third party organisation acts as a middleman for buyers and sellers of financial contracts tied to the underlying value of a share, index, currency or bond. Trillions of euros are handled through clearing houses every year, mostly through London. The ECB said the amendment would give it ""clear legal competence"" in the area of central clearing, which is currently dominated by London firms. Under the proposal, the ECB and its national central banks would monitor risks that could affect monetary policy, the operation of payment systems and the stability of the euro. Analysis: BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker Outside the financial world, clearing houses are a little known but important part of the ""financial infrastructure"" to use the phrase that appears in the key piece of EU legislation. The European Commission has already called closer supervision for euro clearing that takes place outside the EU and the ECB's proposed rule change would give it the power to take on that role. For the firms that use these clearing houses, the ECB's watchful eye is something they could live with. What they don't want is a requirement to have euro denominated business decamp out of London. They have to put money up front to use these facilities and they can use it more efficiently that if it's not dispersed in many different places. Daniel Hodson of the Financial Services Negotiation Forum told the BBC that at the moment the ECB did not have sovereignty over euro clearing in London, as its UK regulator - the Bank of England - is responsible. However, there are ""substantial"" arrangements in place with the ECB that are ""very similar"" to those in place with US regulators for dollar clearing, he said. ""There is no economic reason for changing this well-developed and thought out established framework, adapted as appropriate post-Brexit,"" he said. ""There is a strong argument that to try to move substantial amounts of London based euro clearing business into the eurozone would actually create more systemic risk than it would offset,"" he added. The move comes after the European Commission put forward reforms that would impose stricter supervision of the euro derivatives market and could force operators to leave London as a result of Brexit. At the moment London is the world leader for clearing all types of currency-denominated derivatives including the euro.",The European Central Bank has put forward a proposal to boost its oversight over euro clearing.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Writer Mike Tinmouth was furious with the process and time taken to open a business account with Barclays. He expressed his frustration in a public tweet - which was seized on by fraudsters who posed as the bank in an attempt to trick him out of £8,000. Fraud experts say con-artists are becoming skilled at impersonation. 'Lulled into paying' Mr Tinmouth wanted to open a business account to deal with the income and expenditure of some properties that he was letting to tenants. He applied to Barclays, but the process dragged on and eventually he made a complaint on Twitter. He even posted an email that he received from the bank which he felt was unprofessional and had to confirm was genuine. The bank urged him to delete this public post. All this information, together with some personal details that were already available about him online, was enough for fraudsters to mimic the bank and appear to know details of the case. ""They targeted me because they are monitoring the big banks' customer support Twitter channels where they can get enough information on name, location, and photo to then be able to track down further information,"" he said. Soon after the Twitter exchange, he received another email apologising for the poor service and offering to deal with his case. This time the message was from a fraudster posing as his bank. After various exchanges, he was provided with details of his ""new"" account, and he started to transfer money from his personal current account with a different bank. The transfer was blocked, saving Mr Tinmouth from losing the £8,000 he intended to move between the two accounts. Barclays said that customers should always be careful about posting details in public, and that it had a system of ensuring customers dealt with the bank's social media teams on private channels. No-one should transfer money to a new account without having all the relevant paperwork and full control of the account, a spokesman added. ""In this case, we advised Mr Tinmouth on the process he should follow to speak to us about his query. However while we were in contact, he engaged with an unverified email address and provided personal information to scammers, which led to him being targeted,"" a spokesman said. Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, which represents the major banks, said that criminals would try to impersonate legitimate organisations, such as banks, police, utility companies or retailers. They would contact potential victims through social media applications in an attempt to trick them into giving away their details. ""Always question any phone calls, texts, tweets or emails out of the blue asking for your personal information in case it is a scam, and never automatically click on any links,"" she said. ""Instead contact the company directly on a known phone number or email, such as the one on their official website. If you think your personal or financial information may have been stolen, contact your bank straight away and also report it to Action Fraud."" Names matter The attempt to trick Mr Tinmouth happened in the same week that plans were confirmed for a new system aimed at reducing fraud. The Payment Systems Regulator has now opened consultation into the proposal to ensure than a recipient's name is checked, along with their account number and sort code when transferring money. How Confirmation of Payee will work When setting up a new payment, or amending an existing one, banks will be able to check the name on the account of the person or organisation you are paying. This process would have stopped Mr Tinmouth earlier in the process, as he would have realised that the destination account was not his own, but in the name of somebody else entirely. Other victims of fraud may also have been stopped from transferring money had they realised the account holder they were paying was wrong. Gareth Shaw, from consumer group Which?, said the change - which would take effect ""early"" in 2019 - was long overdue. ""Customers will question why it's taken their bank so long to implement a system that could have prevented devastating financial losses years ago,"" he said. ""To halt the alarming rise in bank transfer scams we must now see swift implementation of this much-needed measure across the board.""",A bank customer was tricked into transferring money by fraudsters who pretended to be responding to his angry Twitter post about poor service.
"But some policymakers remain doubtful that the gains will appear in the form of rapid inflation and higher wages. Those members urged their colleagues to be ""patient"" as they weigh future rate rises. The views were revealed in minutes published on Wednesday from the Fed's January meeting. The meeting, the final gathering led by former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, concluded 31 January. It preceded turmoil in the stock market that has been pinned partly on investor calculations that the Fed might raise interest rates more rapidly than anticipated. Investors were reacting to data, including wage increases, that suggested inflation might be stronger than in recent years, prompting the Fed to raise rates more quickly. US stocks jumped after the minutes were released, but sank again as the afternoon continued, reflecting continuing uncertainty about the bank's future course. Meeting details The Fed has been shifting away from the policies aimed at economic stimulus it enacted during the recession, including ultra-low interest rates. The bank took no action to raise rates at its January meeting, but markets expect at least three rate rises this year, and predict the Fed will take its next action in March. Investors are also watching carefully to see if new Fed chair Jerome Powell takes a more aggressive stance than Ms Yellen, who was viewed as moving relatively slowly to raise rates. At the January meeting, ""almost all"" Fed members - more than previously - said they expect inflation to hit the bank's 2% target over the medium term, bolstering the case for future rate rises. A number of Federal Reserve members also ""marked up"" forecasts for 2018 growth to reflect stronger economic data since December, according to the minutes. However, the record showed the participants continued to hold a wide range of views about inflation and wage pressures. While some see the possibility of rapid inflation, others see ""little solid evidence"" of inflation or wage pressures, the minutes said. ""They judged that the committee could afford to be patient"". Ken Matheny, executive director for US economics at Macroeconomic Advisers by IHS Markit, said the discussion was ""consistent"" with predictions of several rate rises in 2018. Mr Matheny, whose firm is predicting four rate rises this year, said he expects inflation will finally hit the Fed's 2% target causing ""dovish sentiments to fade"".","The US Federal Reserve is preparing for stronger-than-expected economic growth this year, a view that boosts the case for higher interest rates."
"The pipeline currently runs under the Baltic Sea, delivering Russia's huge reserves of gas into Germany. BP said any potential extension to the pipeline was unlikely to be agreed before next summer. As North Sea production falls away, the UK has begun to import more gas from overseas, mainly from Norway and Qatar. Extending the Nordstream pipeline would be seen as another potential source of energy, which is needed to compensate for a shortfall in supply resulting from the closure of coal and nuclear power plants in the UK over the next two decades. Last month, BP agreed to sell its 50% stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft for $17.1bn (£10.1bn) in cash and a 12.8% stake in the Russian oil group. The deal has freed BP up to pursue other interests in the region.",BP has held preliminary talks with the Russian government and stakeholders in the Nordstream pipeline about extending the line to deliver gas to the UK.
"Like-for-like retail sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell by 1.1% across the Christmas period. General merchandise sales, including at Sainsbury's-owned Argos, fell by 2.3% and overall clothing sales by 0.2%. Chief executive Mike Coupe said: ""Retail markets are highly competitive and very promotional and the consumer outlook continues to be uncertain."" 'Tough market' He added: ""General merchandise sales grew strongly over the key Christmas weeks and outperformed the market over the quarter. ""Sales declined in the quarter due to cautious customer spending and our decision to reduce promotional activity across Black Friday. Clothing performed well, with strong full-price sales growth in a tough market."" He said shoppers also cut back on their spending on food over Christmas, with slower sales growth for the premium Taste the Difference range. However, the supermarket giant said in the 15 weeks to 9 January, grocery sales grew by 0.4%, with groceries online and in convenience stores up by 6% and 3%. Sainsbury's shares were ahead by 2.18% in midday trading in London. Analysis by Today business presenter Dominic O'Connell Pundits had expected Sainsbury's to have the weakest Christmas numbers of the big four grocery chains. They were right - but for the wrong reasons. Sainsbury's core grocery business did quite well given the fierce competition from the mainstream rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Asda, and the extra squeeze from the German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl. The weakness came in so-called general merchandise, which includes Argos, which Sainsbury's bought two years ago. The problem, Sainsbury's said, was not Christmas trading, but Black Friday. It chose not to follow rivals' fierce discounting and sales suffered accordingly. While this explanation is undoubtedly correct, it will not impress investors, who will point out that Argos was meant to provide diversification away from the super-competitive grocery market, and that complaining about discounting on Black Friday is like complaining about cold weather in January. All this week's trading updates show only sales. We will not know the real winners - which retailers turned those sales into profits - until later in the year, in Sainsbury's case in the full-year results in May. 'Mixed bag' The third-quarter retail sales figure was worse than analysts had expected, having predicted a 0.2% decline. Retail analyst Teresa Wickham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is a mixed bag. Christmas has clearly been difficult for them."" She said Sainsbury's had had to make difficult decisions about how far it should go down the promotional route in order to compete with Aldi and Lidl. But she added that the UK's second-largest grocery chain had a ""very valuable property in Argos"", despite the fall in merchandise sales. And Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics said: ""These results aren't disastrous but demonstrate the significant challenges faced by the big grocers."" Sainsbury's plans to merge with rival Asda, with a verdict on the plan due from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in February. Mr Coupe denied that the emphasis on the merger meant Sainsbury's management had lost direction. He said there were about 20 people dealing with the merger, but more than 100,000 members of staff focused on Sainsbury's customers. He said the firm continued to have constructive talks with the CMA and was confident a merger would ""bring lower prices for consumers"". 'Hugely disruptive' Meanwhile, Sainsbury's, like other UK supermarkets, is preparing for the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal. Mr Coupe said a no-deal Brexit would be very challenging for retailers, given that UK retailers bring in more than 30% of their volumes from continental Europe. ""There is only so much contingency planning you can do,"" he said. ""We have 20 distribution centres and each one can hold about a week's worth of food. But it is not as if there are another 20 distribution centres out there."" How have other retailers fared over Christmas? Mr Coupe said a lot of the stock that the firm brought in from mainland Europe was fresh fruit and vegetables, which could only be held for short periods of times and not be stockpiled. ""It would be hugely disruptive if there was a no-deal Brexit, and we would have to manage that on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis,"" he added. ""We don't have the capacity to manage more than one week's worth of stock.""",Sainsbury's has seen sales fall over Christmas after non-food trading was hit by consumer caution.
"Those closures, along with reorganisation elsewhere at the bank, will affect 1,230 jobs. Lloyds says it is creating 925 jobs and existing staff will be redeployed ""wherever possible"". Of the 49 banks earmarked for closure eight belong to the Halifax network and the other 41 are Lloyds branches. After those cuts the group will have 1,750 branches in total. You can find a list of the banks due to close here. Like other banks Lloyds has been reducing the size of its network as customers have switched to online and telephone banking. When chief executive Antonio Horta Osorio took over in 2011 Lloyds Banking Group had almost 2,900 outlets, of which more than 600 were were spun-off in 2013 under the TSB brand name. In October 2014 Lloyds announced 400 branch closures as part of a three year plan and last November another 49 were scheduled to be shut. Lloyds says the banks affected in the latest round of closures all have a Post Office ""within short walking distance"", where banking services will be available. Even after the latest closures, Lloyds says it will still have the biggest branch network. ""The changes in roles are in line with our plan to adapt to and meet the changing needs of our customers,"" the bank said in a statement. ""Today's announcement involves making difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way,"" it added. However, Federation of Small Business national chairman Mike Cherry said the bank's decision to accelerate its bank branch closure programme would ""come as a real blow"" to small businesses in the local communities affected. ""Equally, bank branches are vital to encouraging high street footfall. Cash is still the preferred payment method for thousands of shoppers. ""Reduced access to free to use cash machines is bad for our already embattled high streets and bad for local growth,"" he added. In February Lloyds announced annual profits of £5.3bn, up 24% on the previous year and its strongest performance since 2006.",Lloyds Banking Group has announced that 49 branches will be closed.
"However, a closer look at the 43-year-old's career and achievements suggests that he may well turn out be more of a perfect fit rather than a surprise choice. A graduate of the London Business School, Mr Mistry is the youngest son of construction baron Pallonji Shapoorji Mistry. He holds Irish nationality and hails from one of the richest Indian families with a net worth of $7.6bn (£4.9bn). His family is also the single-largest shareholder in Tata Sons with a stake of 18%. But it is not just his lineage and shareholding in the Tata group that has worked in favour of Mr Mistry. He joined the board of Shapoorji Pallonji & Company as director in 1991 and was appointed the managing director of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group in 1994. During his reign, Shapoorji Pallonji's construction business grew from a turnover of $20m to almost $1.5bn. Mr Mistry also oversaw the diversification of the company from just construction, to design and build and complex projects in the marine, oil and gas, rail sectors. The group's international construction business also expanded its presence to more than ten countries. Under his leadership, the companies also registered many firsts in India - construction of the tallest residential towers, the longest rail bridge, the largest dry dock and the largest affordable housing project. Shapoorji Pallonji Group's recent foray into agriculture and bio fuels, with the leasing of 50,000 hectares in Ethiopia, was overseen by Mr Mistry. Soft spoken He joined the board of Tata Sons in 2006, and has been a director of Tata Power and Tata Elxsi. He is also on the board of the Construction Federation of India, the Imperial College Advisory Board, the Board of Governors of National Institute of Construction Management and Research, and is a Fellow of the Institute of Civil Engineers. On the personal front, Mr Mistry is described by friends and colleagues as a soft spoken and candid individual who believes in consensus. In his free time, he is known to enjoy playing golf and is a prolific reader. Despite the various hats that he wears and his high-profile, Mr Mistry likes to stay away from the limelight. However, as he gets ready to take charge of India's biggest company, that is one attribute that he may have to change.","The media have labelled Cyrus P Mistry as a ""surprise"" choice to replace Ratan Tata as the chairman of Tata Group."
"In a speech, he said: ""Globalisation is associated with low wages, insecure employment, stateless corporations and striking inequalities."" There are ""staggering wealth inequalities"" in many advanced economies, he added. Mr Carney was speaking in Liverpool. He told his audience that politicians and central bankers must act to ensure people do not lose faith in the current system. ""Turning our backs on open markets would be a tragedy, but it is a possibility,"" he said. ""It can only be averted by confronting the underlying reasons for this risk upfront."" Ahmed: Carney says get real, there are losers from free trade Mr Carney, giving the Roscoe Lecture at Liverpool John Moores University, spoke of the need for wealth distribution and putting individuals back in control. He cited Prime Minister Theresa May's criticism of ""stateless corporations"" who paid little tax and had little responsibility to local communities. The governor said: ""Redistribution and fairness also mean turning back the tide of stateless corporations."" ""As the prime minister recently stressed, companies must be rooted and pay tax somewhere. ""Businesses operating across borders have responsibilities,"" he added. 'Challenges to prosperity' The lecture is only the second major public speech Mr Carney has given since the June Brexit referendum. Since that vote, the governor has had to defend himself against criticism that he had made explicitly pro-Remain comments, and also against suggestions that the prime minister had been unhappy with the Bank's monetary policy because savers had lost out. However, although Mr Carney acknowledged in his speech that there were losers from the policy of low interest rates, he said: ""The thrifty saver and the rich asset holder are often one and the same."" ""Just 2% of households have deposit holdings in excess of £5,000, [they have] few other financial assets, and don't own a home. ""So the vast majority of savers who might have lost some interest income from lower policy rates have stood to gain from increases in asset prices, particularly the recovery in house prices,"" he added. The challenges to greater prosperity, he said, were far wider. Mr Carney listed three priorities: Last week, the bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, struck a similar note when he warned about Britain's widening inequality gap. He was concerned not just with the gap between rich and poor, but also geographically - between north and south, east and west. Mr Haldane said in a speech: ""I think [the issue of regional inequality] is right up there as among the most important issues that we face today as a country."" ""What's more, the variations are among the widest in Europe.""",Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has warned that people will reject free and open markets unless something is done to help those left behind by the financial crisis and globalisation.
"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter What has now ended is the UK's economic membership of the bloc. Forty-eight years in the European customs union, basically the Common Market, and 28 years in the single market. The Single Market was a creation for which the UK has paternity rights. It was Margaret Thatcher's rallying call for European reform, her calling card to unleash a wave of Japanese investment in post-industrial Britain and shepherded into existence by her appointee as commissioner Arthur Cockfield. 'Tortuous negotiations' Its creation served the UK's economic interests, as it grew the home domestic market available for British exporters without tariff or non-tariff barriers, eventually to nearly half a billion Europeans. It was not without irony that the tortuous negotiations of the past four years were made tougher by the EU's insistence on defending what it calls the ""internal market"", itself created by the British. Indeed the institutional underpinning of this huge marketplace became too much for Mrs Thatcher. Famously she became suspicious of Commission President Delors turning up to tell the TUC that through the European Union workers could reassert rights rolled back by the Conservative Government. At her 1988 Bruges speech PM Thatcher replied: ""We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the state in Britain, only to see them re-imposed at European level, with a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels."" Perhaps this was the beginning of the path to Brexit, carried along by the push to monetary union and resentment at the overreach of the European Court of Justice and the considerable impact of the ""direct effect"" of community and then union law. The car industry was the prototype for the single market. Mrs Thatcher's campaigning for EEC membership was quickly followed by a charm offensive that began as opposition leader to get Japanese investors to build high tech factories to sell cars tariff-free across Europe. For the UK it would provide employment, technology, capital and competition for the languishing nationalised UK-owned auto sector. Conformity Ongoing membership of the EEC, restrictions on union activity and investment tax breaks were part of the deal communicated in writing to the then chairman of Nissan. The Datsun Bluebird was being developed in Sunderland and around the same time the Italians and the French threatened to slap tariffs on what they saw as a Japanese ruse to avoid tariffs and undercut their industry. The UK government quickly communicated that it was willing to take this matter to the European Court of Justice. The attempt to kill the Nissan factory at birth was fended off. From this, the UK car industry and other advanced manufacturing prospered from being plugged into rapid continent-wide supply chains, delivering each part just in time and just in sequence. All of that was enabled by conformity of regulations, standards, zero tariffs and the eradication of non-tariff barriers, for sale, but also within the manufacturing process. Similar stories could be told about the pharmaceutical industry, chemicals, the food industry, aerospace, and financial services. Within the EU, the UK even became the financial centre for a new currency, the euro, which it did not participate in. The single market itself, with regulations set and enforced in Brussels, became a player on the world stage. And yet there was a balancing act. The UK could influence the direction of one of the biggest tankers in the sea but was restricted in acting more nimbly in new industries. In some sectors, the UK's trade dealings with the US or Asia were more important than with Europe. And so this tension led to breaking point. And for the Conservative Party in particular the single market's institutions it created and championed, became something akin to Frankenstein's monster. Some Brexiteers had hoped that the edifice would collapse once the UK left. But it has proven more robust than that. Indeed, Brexit has proven a catalyst of the EU to sign trade and investment deals far more quickly, including even with China. So now the UK finds itself outside of the machine it created as its strategic competitor. The trade negotiation wasn't primarily about trade. Great Britain has declared regulatory independence, or to be more specific, has declared as much regulatory independence as is compatible with a zero-tariff trade deal. The EU retains levers and switches to turn off some of these tariff advantages should the UK use the deal to turn into an offshore tariff free assembly hub for US and Asian manufacturing to be traded into the single market. Unlike with Nissan four decades ago, the European Court of Justice will no longer be there. The PM wants regulatory competition but his own deal contains disincentives, if not actual restrictions, on competing ""unfairly"" or too much. So the strategy matters. Britain is free, but to do what exactly? To level up? Well the regions that need levelling up are the ones that are actually most dependent on exports to Europe. Exports to Europe will be spared tariffs, thanks to the deal, but there will be literally millions of non-tariff barriers, that the economists calculate matter more, from health checks, customs formalities, origin paperwork, assessments of standards etc. Even to qualify for tariff-free treatment means, according to new government guidance on ""rules of origin"", analysis of how complicated is the process of grating cheese, of the shelling of nuts, and formalities on where the eyes of a doll come from. Most apply legally from tonight, having been absent for decades. The sweet spot for UK will now be to deploy regulatory freedom in sectors that are truly global, where we are not already overly dependent on EU markets. Certain sub-sectors within technology, finance and pharmaceuticals, for example. In each of these sectors the UK is likely to have to offer more friendly regulation to the multinational private sector, than the EU. It doesn't necessarily mean lower standards: It could be that UK medicines regulators, for example, build on the record of rapid approval for Covid vaccines in other medical areas. 'Picking winners' The deployment of massive scientific networks within the National Health service, used for rapid clinical testing, could become the envy of the world. Brexit Britain is likely to become a laboratory for the global economy. Car companies will need to be attracted with more permissive rules on data and, say autonomous driving testing. Some tech companies are already porting their UK customers to be served under US data privacy laws rather than more restrictive EU ones. But the government will also have to be very active and judicious. We are already ""picking winners"" again, at least in the satellite business. What about electric power, where the EU will fight aggressively, versus hydrogen power? There are a number of structural economic problems, from poor training, declining productivity and low investment that were not caused by EU membership which, in terms of non-tariff barriers, are made immediately worse by this type of Brexit, for which the UK has no option but to deal with. That process of looking outwards may not come quickly. Holyrood and Stormont rejected the Brexit trade deal. The UK has replaced a single market of 500 million Europeans free of non-tariff barriers with a single market smaller than the size of the UK. There is a trade border in the Irish Sea. Northern Ireland is mostly left in the EU single market. There are non-tariff barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland as a result of this deal. Unpredictable knock-on effects Lastly there are some big unknowns and unknowables. The inadvertent diplomatic consequences of changes in trade patterns can be profound. If, for example, the eminent historian RW Johnson is to be believed, the UK's accession to the EEC in the first place created the conditions for the fall of South Africa's apartheid regime which was ""hurt in several ways"". British trade was remodelled away from the Commonwealth to Europe, the EEC offered favourable trade with all of Africa except Pretoria. And then when Portugal followed its ally the UK into the EEC, its African colonies and white rule quickly lost to revolutions by black liberation movements in Angola and Mozambique. ""Thus the seeds of the 1976 Soweto uprising were sown"" in part by the UK joining the EEC. Which is obviously not to suggest the reverse would be true. It is merely to say that events such as these can have very unpredictable knock on effects. The Prime Minister has succeeded in taking the UK out of the Single Market created by his heroes. The UK now stands outside a system that it helped invent. For now its new single market is not the size of the country. The test of all of this, is to make the UK's new single market the size of the globe.",Nearly half a century of the UK's membership of the European Union and its predecessor organisations ended in January of course.
"Ned is 31 and lives in Dereham, 15 miles outside of Norwich in Norfolk. He works for an audio visual company as a purchaser. His wife, Cara, is a part-time beautician, splitting her time between work and looking after their two-year old son, Theo. During the pandemic Ned was able to work from home for 10 weeks before returning to the office. He says he has always had an interest in personal finance and does his best to achieve a balance between spending money wisely and saving. At the start of the year he chose to build up an emergency fund and says he is so glad he did. Each month he pays his savings account first, leaving just enough money for bills and essentials. This way he is able to save as much as possible and says it's a great feeling seeing his savings grow. Over to Ned... This week is slightly different as I have a week off work - so my spending will be different to normal. It is also the week where most of our bills come out. Cara and I put £650 each into our joint account where all our bills are paid from. Our mortgage for our three bedroom link-detached house is £670, council tax is £134, £50 direct debit for electricity, £34 for water and £11 for health insurance for the three of us. This comes to £900 but covers everything bar food and phone/internet. Sometimes it can be daunting seeing so much money leave all in one day but I like it coming out at the start of the month, so I know what we have left. Today was the day that we decided Theo's hair had got long enough so needed a cut. We do try and take him to the hairdressers but after last time (total nightmare) we decided to do it at home. His reward was a toy from the toy shop, £14.99 and a couple of hours at soft play, £4.95. Cara and I had a hot chocolate each which came to £5. I also picked up a prescription which cost me £9.15 and will last a month. Total spend for the day was £900 on bills and £34.09 for bribes, drinks and medication. Total spend: £934.09 My Money More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you. Theo was at nursery today so Cara and I had a rare day to ourselves. We decided to go to Norwich for afternoon tea to celebrate our birthdays and wedding anniversary which wasn't possible during lockdown. This came to £45 but after using a discount card we got 10% off so it came down to £40.50. We then found a few things for Theo's birthday and Christmas presents. Even though this seems like a long time away (November and December) we like to spread the cost over as many months as possible. After multiple visits to toy shops the total damage was £17.95. Cara and Theo do lots of crafts at home too so we bought a few bits for Halloween and Christmas which came to £11. We then bought new wallpaper for Theo's bedroom which came to £25, and a couple of candles which were £2. Car parking was £6. I would have loved to have spent money on clothes today but I'm really trying hard to not spend any money where it's not totally necessary. I have plenty of clothes at home so I remind myself that saving is my top priority right now. Total spend: £102.45 It seems more like a holiday for Theo as today we are off to his favourite place, a dinosaur park which has a great soft play area. We previously bought an annual pass for the three of us which gives us access 10 times a year for £60 each and so brings the cost down to £6 each per visit. This would have normally been £15 each in the summer and £10 each in the winter so we feel it is completely worth it. This will keep Theo happy for a good three hours or so and is great to get us all outside and walking in the fresh air. We would normally take our own lunch but seeing as we are on holiday we decided to buy a very overpriced sandwich, crisps and drink for both Cara and I which came to £12.90. We did however bring Theo's lunch with us so that helps. Overall a day of very little spending. Total spend: £12.90 Thursday was a day in bed for me as I seemed to have caught a stomach bug. No spending for me. Cara decided to do the weekly food shop. We do our main shop in Aldi and then go to Tesco for anything we couldn't get. We used to always do our whole shop in Tesco but found that Aldi was just as good and is cheaper for the basics. Our Aldi shop came to £41.51 and the Tesco shop came to £45.43 (£86.94 in total). Seems we got it the wrong way round this week as the Tesco shop came to more than the Aldi shop. Most likely as Cara decided to get some ""special"" food for our week off. As a side note, this shop also includes everything else you'd expect to get from the supermarket like toiletries etc. This shop will last us all week and we try to stick to £80 a week (£320 a month) where possible. Sometimes this figure will include non food items, for example clothes for Theo or presents for birthdays etc. We have always thought our food bill is high but when trying to eat healthier, food is more expensive, which seems counter productive! A price we are willing to pay. We also use our club card in Tesco which gives us a little back. Every little helps as they say. Total spend: £86.94 Still feeling pretty awful today but decide I need some fresh air to try and make me feel better. We head off to the coast for a walk along the sea front and some time in the arcades. Cara and Theo have fish and chips which comes to £8. After, we go to the arcade and turn a £10 note into more 2p coins than Theo knows what to do with. Worth every penny though as he has a great time and even wins a prize. You can't put a price on your child's happiness. We then go to the play area which is a great way to keep Theo entertained for half an hour and doesn't cost a thing. We try to take him to parks as often as possible as he has just as much fun as say, soft play, but it is free - win win. Car parking comes to £3. Total spend: £21 Urgh, this stomach bug doesn't seem to want to go away. A shame as this morning we had planned to go out for breakfast but food still makes me feel ill so that will have to wait for another weekend. As something to do we jump in the car and head off to Spalding outlet village. I need to fill my car up with fuel and this comes to £58.70. I can't really complain as my car does about 50-55 mpg and this tank should last at least two weeks. I will always budget £120 a month for fuel but the odd month it works out I only need to fill up once. At the fuel station we grab some food for lunch and this totals £8.60. Again, something we wouldn't normally do but as we are off work, convenience is allowed. We end up not buying anything at the shopping village which seems to make the whole trip a little pointless but it was more as something to do and get us out of the house. Again, I could have spent lots of money on clothes but I'm strict with myself and walk away. Go me. Car parking is only £1. Super cheap. Total spend: £68.30 Today we go swimming! We don't go to our local leisure centre but instead opt for a small local pool at a Caravan Club. This is £12 for an hour and we have the whole pool to ourselves. It actually works out cheaper than going to a leisure centre and supports local businesses which we try and do where possible. It's our last night before we are back to work tomorrow so again we opt for an easy meal in the evening. I pop to Tesco to pick up a meal deal which comes to £10. Lasagne, chunky chips and chocolate orange mousse. The bottle of white wine which also comes as part of the deal can stay in the fridge for another night. Still not quite ready for alcohol yet. Total spend: £22 Total spent this week: £1,247.68 How does Ned feel about his week? As I said before, this week has been a little different due to a week off work and also bills week but I'm still happy with how we have spent our money. Most of this spending is split between myself and Cara so only really half of it leaves my personal account. I've only actually spent £67.85 this week in total after bills (£9.15 for prescription and £58.70 for fuel) so can't really complain. As always I've thought about each potential purchase and made myself walk away with the priority being my savings. Once I reach three months of money saved up, I plan to start saving for my next car which I hope to not have to buy for at least another 18 months, two years. I'd also like to have some spare money to take the family away on a little break to try and get away from all the Covid news which fills our lives these days. You'll agree that a lot, if not most, of our spending is on our son, Theo. I suppose I don't mind this at all as this is the reason I go to work each day, to be able to provide for my family and also treat Theo when possible.","My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make.

"Unemployment saw a ""small"" rise of 10,000 to 1.66 million, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. ""These figures show that employment continued to grow over the summer and vacancies remain at high levels, suggesting continuing confidence in the economy,"" the ONS said. Average weekly earnings grew by 2.3%, a slight fall from the previous month. Businesses cautiously welcomed the employment figures, but said more was needed to help boost workers' pay as inflation starts to rise. The CBI business group called the pay growth ""lacklustre"", saying it underlined the need for a ""laser-like"" focus on making companies more productive. With the number of self-employed workers increasing by 273,000 to 4.79 million - 15% of all people in work - more should also be done to guarantee their pensions, mortgages and income protection, the Federation of Small Businesses said. 'More to do' The total number of people in jobs remained at a record high of 31.8 million, the ONS figures showed. Although there was a ""small rise"" in unemployment, it was accompanied by more people actively seeking work, ONS statistician Nick Palmer said. Some of that rise came from more women looking for work. In the three months to August, 73.4% of women were either in work or seeking jobs, the highest rate since records began in 1971, the ONS said. Employment Minister Damian Hinds welcomed the total jobs rate, but said: ""There's more to do, particularly when it comes to supporting young people into employment."" 'Cracks appearing' Businesses and economists said the figures showed UK jobs had proved ""resilient"" since the Brexit vote. However, some also argued that an easing in the pace of job creation suggested the labour market was slowing down. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Markit, said ""cracks are appearing"", as jobs growth dipped to 106,000, compared with the 174,000 jobs added in the three months to July. The unemployment estimates come from the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to 40,000 households. Although it is a very large survey, there is still a margin of error. The ONS says it is 95% confident that the figure of a 10,000 rise in unemployment is correct to within 79,000. As the estimated change is smaller than the margin of error, it means the change in unemployment is not statistically significant.","The UK jobless rate held steady at a near 11-year low of 4.9% in the three months to August, figures show."
"By Laura Heighton-GinnsBusiness reporter Free to play, it involves 100 players in a battle royale situation, where combatants fight until one person is left standing. The last figures released showed 45 million players in total, but that was back in January. A lot has changed since then. App tracker Sensor Tower says Fortnite has been downloaded on Apple devices more than 30 million times since mid-March. It managed to generate $296m (£222m) in April from in-app purchases alone. And that's more than double the revenue for February, according to market research firm SuperData Research. However, creator Epic Games, 40%-owned by Chinese tech titan Tencent, isn't the only one making money out of Fortnite's infectious popularity. The top gamer Michael Baty, 28, works at an Asda store near to his Falkirk home. But he's also something of a celebrity, his name spoken in school classrooms and gaming chat forums. That's because he is the top-ranked Fortnite player in the UK. ""When I go out or meet new people, I'm the Fortnite guy - people have heard of me before I meet them."" Strangers' appreciation of Michael's playing style extends to sending him money. ""People sometimes donate to me as a player. I've received as much as $100 in one-off donations."" He also receives an income from subscriptions on a site called Twitch, which allows you to stream your games. For each subscriber he earns about $2.50 a month. Michael plays Fortnite up to 12 hours a day, depending on whether he's working or has other plans, and prefers to focus on enjoying the game. ""I haven't tried to make a full-time living out of it but I think it's a possibility."" The accessory business Fortnite can be played on a console, PC or through an app. But as well as a device to access the game, most players use a headset. Turtle Beach is a headset supplier that's seen demand surge. In May, it revealed a 185% rise in annual sales. ""By the third week of January we knew something was going on"", says Juergen Stark, Turtle Beach's chief executive, who largely attributes the boost in sales to the popularity of Fortnite. ""The importance of the headset is that it brings the social element - as well as the survival advantage of better communication, and of enhancing the experience with surround sound."" With other game developers taking note of the rise of battle royale concepts, Turtle Beach is expecting its sales to keep growing. The pro-buddy For those who want to improve their game, a helping hand can be enlisted in the form of a pro-gaming buddy. This is a player with an impressive record on Fortnite who provides remote coaching and guides clients through the game. Aaron Hobson is working as a pro-buddy alongside training to be an accountant. He says he helps with strategy for maximising kills in the game, including developing defensive structures, known as building. ""Building's probably the most critical part of Fortnite. If you can't build and save yourself from getting shot, you'll just get killed."" Aaron charges £7 an hour for his time. Listings site Bidvine sets out the role of a pro-gamer. ""All you need to be a Fortnite Pro Buddy is a strong wireless connection, a PS4, Xbox 1 or a gaming PC. Oh - and at least 25 wins!"" It suggests a charge of up to £30 per hour, but invites potential pro-buddies to set their own rates. The streaming service Big corporations are now getting in on the act too, in the form of live streaming, as growing numbers of people want to watch others' games. Facebook has launched Fb.gg, to compete with Amazon-owned Twitch and Google-owned YouTube. There's a key reason: the young viewers are a big draw for advertisers. In April, a game joined by Drake racked up 635,000 concurrent views. As Turtle Beach's Juergen Stark says: ""It's more than a game... it's a place to hang out.""","Video game Fortnite has attracted millions of fans worldwide, including Canadian musician Drake and England footballer Dele Alli."
"Mr Botin died of a heart attack on Tuesday night. The appointments and remuneration committee and the board of directors met on Wednesday to appoint a successor. Ms Botin, a scion of a banking dynasty, was previously the chief executive of Santander UK. ""The appointments and remuneration committee considered Ana Botin is the most appropriate person, given her personal and professional qualities, experience, track record in the group and her unanimous recognition both in Spain and internationally,"" Santander said. Ms Botin is the fourth generation of the family to take charge of the bank. Her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, who were all named Emilio, also served as chairmen of Santander. She has been on the board of Santander since 1989. Ms Botin was appointed to lead the UK arm of Santander in 2010, and was chairwoman of Santander's Spanish-based subsidiary Banesto from 2002 to 2010. She began her banking career at JPMorgan. BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed said it would ""not be too much of an exaggeration to put her in the top three"" women in the world with significant financial power, along with Christine Lagarde at the IMF and Janet Yellen at the Federal Reserve. Santander, in the top 20 global banks by size, is a hugely influential operation across Europe and Latin America. Santander UK said that its board would meet next week to choose a new chief executive. Nathan Bostock, the bank's recently-installed UK deputy chief executive, will be responsible for overseeing operations and strategy in the transition phase.","Ana Botin has been appointed the new chairwoman of the Spanish banking giant Santander, following the death of her father, Emilio Botin."
"Cyrus Mistry, a current director of Tata, will spend a year as deputy chairman under Ratan Tata until he takes over the reins in December 2012. He is the younger son of construction tycoon Pallonji Mistry, who owns 18% of Tata Group. Mr Mistry's family is India's seventh richest with a net worth of $7.6bn (£4.9bn). Tata, which owns Jaguar Land Rover, is India's biggest company with a value of about $98bn, and has interests including telecoms, engineering and science. The 143-year-old group has more than 100 companies in more than 80 countries, employing 425,000 people. Ratan Tata, 73, was appointed chairman of the group in 1991, and led the takeover of Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus in 2007. 'Deeply honoured' Although Tata has been a strongly family-run business, Ratan Tata has no children and there was much speculation about his successor after he announced he would retire by the end of 2012. Welcoming the appointment, Mr Tata said: ""I have been impressed with the quality and calibre of his participation, his astute observations and his humility."" Mr Mistry, 43, said in a statement he was ""deeply honoured"" by the appointment. He said: ""I am aware that an enormous responsibility, with a great legacy, has been entrusted to me. I look forward to Mr Tata's guidance in the year ahead in meeting the expectations of the group."" Mr Mistry said he would ""undertake to legally dissociate myself from the management of my family businesses to avoid any issue of conflict of interest"". Although he will be the first chairman from outside the family, Mr Mistry does have a connection - his sister is married to Mr Tata's half-brother.",The Tata Group of companies has announced the replacement for outgoing chairman Ratan Tata.
"Demand for fiction and non-fiction jumped, while audio-book sales were up 37%, the Publishers Association said. Bestsellers included The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo and 7 Ways by Jamie Oliver. But educational book sales slumped as schools were shut for months. Stephen Lotinga, chief executive of the Publishers' Association, said: ""It's clear that many people rediscovered their love of reading last year and that publishers were able to deliver the entertaining and thought-provoking books that so many of us needed. ""But we shouldn't ignore the fact that it's been a particularly challenging year for education publishers and many smaller publishers. ""It's also been a hugely difficult time for many booksellers and authors whose livelihoods have been enormously disrupted."" Bestselling consumer titles in 2020 Source: Nielsen According to the association, total UK publishing sales - including consumer, educational and academic titles - rose 2% in 2020 to £6.4bn. The consumer market performed particularly well, with sales of fiction up 16% and non-fiction by 4%. Print accounted for £1.7bn of those sales (up 4%) while for digital it was £418m, up 24%. Other bestselling titles included The Mirror and the Light by Hilary Mantel and Barack Obama's memoir A Promised Land, published in November, which sold well in audio. The UK's enormous academic publishing industry also remained in good shape, with total income up 3% at £3.3bn. But sales of school textbooks and word books fell by a fifth. Mr Lotinga said: ""With bookshops now able to reopen, and physical events returning, we are optimistic that people will soon be able to enjoy books together again. ""We need to harness this return to reading and build on the huge opportunity this presents to everyone.""","UK consumer book sales climbed 7% to £2.1bn last year as people ""rediscovered their love of reading"" in lockdown, the industry body says."
"A typical premium among the most competitive products dropped by 1.4% in the first three months of the year, it found. It said that changes in the law and competition among insurers had pushed down prices. And it expects further falls as new reforms come into force. The AA Insurance Shoparound survey takes an average premium for a standard set of risks from the five cheapest quotes from insurers and price comparison websites. This has shown large rises in insurance costs over a three year period, but has now started to register a fall. The average premium among the cheapest deals stood at £746.75, the survey found. Claims clampdown The AA said that controlling personal injury claims was key to keeping premiums down. At the start of April, a ban was enforced on referral fees, which are paid by lawyers and claims management firms to breakdown firms, brokers and the insurers themselves - in exchange for providing information about accident victims. The government is also limiting legal fees. In February, Aviva - the UK's biggest insurer - called for reforms to go further. It wants to see a new process that would force whiplash victims to put their claims directly to the insurer of the driver who caused the crash. This would cut motorists' premiums by an average of £60 a year, it said. Whiplash claims were a major factor behind the rapid rise in the price of motor cover. They account for 80% of injury claims, and with most going through lawyers, Aviva suggested that all this accounted for £118 of a typical motor insurance premium. Meanwhile, the AA said that the cheapest home insurance deals were also falling in cost, down by just under 2% over the last year.","The cost of motor insurance has fallen by 4.1% over the last year, according to an AA survey of the cheapest deals on the market."
"By Elizabeth HotsonBusiness reporter, BBC News In the gracious surroundings of the wood-panelled Jubilee Room, corks are popped, beer is guzzled and lemons fizz in free-flowing G&Ts. But despite the prodigious volume of liquid being consumed, there aren't any slurred words or collisions with furniture. That's because, contrary to appearances, no alcohol is actually being drunk. The event is co-organised by Club Soda, a ""mindful drinking movement"", and is being held to showcase low and alcohol-free drinks. The group, which has about 15,000 members, was co-founded by Jussi Tolvi and Laura Willoughby. Jussi still enjoys the odd alcoholic tipple, but Laura is teetotal. ""I gave up drinking six years ago and was stuck with a tonic or a really bad non-alcohol beer,"" says Laura. ""There is demand for good products, but industry is taking time to catch up. Having said that, big companies like Heineken are spending money on creating a beer that tastes like their full-strength product and to me, this shows that it isn't a fad, it's a market shift."" The demand appears to be borne out in the figures. The Office for National Statistics found that in 2016, 20.9% of Brits drank no alcohol, up two percentage points from 2005. At the same time, CGA, a food and drink data firm, found that for the on-trade - that's restaurants, bars and festivals etc - sales of no and lower alcohol beers, ciders, wines, spirits and mocktails were £232m in 2017. That's up about 3% on the year before. Among the MPs ploughing their way through booze-free tipples at the drinks event is Fiona Bruce MP, chair of the all-party Parliamentary Group on Alcohol Harm. ""There are some lovely options: prosecco, G&T, ale and lager,"" she says. ""Later, I'm going to be able to go into the chamber of the House of Commons this afternoon and not be in the least bit woozy."" Botanical buzz Intrigued, I try a ""teetotal G&T"" from the Temperance Spirit Company. It's sold 500,000 bottles in the last year and is one of a new breed of adult-focused soft drinks. Served over ice and with a slice of cucumber, it looks the part. But after the first sip, I'm not convinced; it lacks that deliciously dry bite of the real thing. Company director Gillian Venning encourages me to persevere: ""It takes a while for the flavour to come through, but you'll soon start to taste the botanicals."" The juniper does indeed creep up on me and although that warm ginny buzz is missing, it's far more interesting than the lemonades and colas normally on offer for non-drinkers. So why are people drinking less? Jane Peyton, founder of the School of Booze, says there are several reasons: ""I recently went to a mindful drinking festival and some people said they weren't drinking because they were pregnant, for others it was religion, but for many it was for health reasons."" Jane's last point chimes with the revelation that during this year's Winter Olympics, German athletes drank gallons of imported non-alcoholic beer. According to skier Linus Strasser, ""It tastes good and it's good for the body. Alcohol-free wheat beer is extremely healthy. It's isotonic. That's why it's good for us sports guys."" 'Good karma' This is music to the ears of Steve Dass, co-founder of Nirvana Brewery. ""We're the UK's only alcohol-free brewery,"" he says. ""It's a holistic movement, we're all vegetarian, we hardly drink, it's about good vibes, good karma and we also have yoga sessions in the brewery."" But do they have good beer? Steve pours me a pint of Karma, a pale ale with an ABV (alcohol by volume) of 0.5%. It's billed as ""light, refreshing, with classic citrus and floral hop aromas leading to a dry bitter finish"". As a fan of big, flavourful beers, I like the taste, but it doesn't have the all-important body. Next up is Chakra, ""a hopped pale ale with fresh notes of passion fruit, pine & a light bitter finish"". This is more like it. At 1% ABV it drinks more like something akin to 3.5% and I reckon I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference in a blind tasting. ""Not being able to tell the difference"" is something The Big Drop Brewing Co's Chocolate Milk Stout has arguably managed to achieve; it won a silver medal in the 2017 World Beer Awards in competition against full-strength rivals. Delicate and refined Although beer is one of the most visible parts of the low and no-alcohol market, the sector in general can be hugely innovative. Zoe Burgess is head of research and development at the Drink Factory, a bar group and consultancy. At a laboratory in East London, she creates both regular and alcohol-free products. ""The key to making good non-alcoholic drinks is to pay as much attention to them as alcoholic drinks, keeping them delicate, refined, using beautiful glasses,"" she says. ""There's no reason they should be treated any differently."" Zoe takes a bag of yellowish liquid from the fridge. ""This is pear shrub syrup. We take whole pears which we slice and cover in caster sugar for a day, add verjus, which is a very delicate vinegar, blend and strain. ""This creates a fine syrup which captures the balance of the pear. We top it up with soda to get that lovely sparkle."" Zoe and her team work with some of the world's most exclusive bars, but non-alcoholic alternatives are also becoming more popular in mainstream outlets. Bar chain Be At One offers nine alcohol-free cocktails. ""In the last 12 to 18 months, we've seen a growth in demand for drinks which are more like cocktails,"" says area manager Tim Sparrow. ""Customers are coming out with friends or work colleagues, so we're dealing with social experiences as much as the drinks themselves. People don't want to feel as though they're being left out just because they're not drinking."" 'More fun' As a designated driver, TV and radio presenter, Susannah Streeter is often left drinking Virgin Marys and she's keen to try something different, so she joins me in a tasting at the chain's Soho branch. Her verdict is mixed. First up is the Botanical: Seedlip Garden 108 non-alcoholic spirit plus egg white, apple juice and sugar syrup. ""It's made my eyebrows stand on end! It's got a kick to it and it looks like a champagne cocktail. I also like the glass it's served in.""

We finish with a Bean: coffee, cream and almond syrup. ""It's quite substantial and I'd get one as a treat, it's more fun than a lime and soda."" So would Susannah order a non-alcoholic cocktail in a bar? ""Yes, if I'd had enough to drink already or I was driving. The choice is usually really boring, so it's nice to have some options.""","It's 13:00 on a Wednesday lunchtime and in the Palace of Westminster, a very lively drinks party is in full swing."
"Panasonic said the introduction of a 'curry' button followed complaints from customers struggling to fully get the food off their clothes. It says development took two years, testing combinations of water temperature and water flow. The machine has five other cycles aimed at the Indian consumer, including one to remove traces of hair oil. Wringing the changes As part of the development, Panasonic researchers analysed what went into a typical Indian household's curry dish. The firm said it then tried to establish the optimal time and water temperature required to remove the stains. Panasonic said it planned similar machines for other Asian markets, tackling stains specific to those countries, but would not elaborate. Only about 10% of homes in India have a washing machine, with most people still doing their laundry by hand. That means there is plenty of room for market growth, and the electronics giant hopes the India-focussed machine will help it challenge the South Korean manufacturers dominating the sector. Panasonic told the BBC that about 5,000 of the machines had been sold so far, with a target to sell at least 30,000 by March next year. Priced at about 22,000 Indian rupees (£268;$330), the new model costs around 10% more than other washing machines. Panasonic entered the India market in 1990, first producing rice cookers and then expanding its line to also manufacture air conditioners. In December last year, the company announced it would set up a factory in the North Indian state of Haryana making refrigerators. The Japanese firm has associated itself with other headline-grabbing products. Last year it invested $60m (£49m) in Seven Dreamers, a Japanese start-up which is developing what it claims to be the world's first robot that folds laundry.","A washing machine has been launched for the Indian market, with a special mode to tackle curry stains."
"It comes a week after amateur investors piled into shares in the games retailer GameStop, causing them to jump 700%. On Monday silver rose by as much as 11% to $30 an ounce, while shares in some mining firms were up as much as 60%. Small time traders swapping tips on Reddit are thought to be behind the trend, as they seek to drive prices up. However, some users of the site dispute this, alleging the ""Silver Squeeze"" is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms. What is going on? It is the latest example of apparently small-time traders taking on big Wall Street hedge funds that hope to profit when the price of an asset or stock falls, but could lose heavily if it rises. Tips posted on social media sites like Reddit say these so called ""short sellers"" are manipulating the markets. And so the amateurs buy up the stocks or assets, driving up the price and inflicting losses on the big players. It began in January when amateurs piled into loss-making retailer GameStop and other companies such as AMC and Blackberry. GameStop shares, which were trading at less than $20 (£14.61) each at the start of January, shot to nearly $350 last week. They fell 30% on Monday to $225. Now the battle appears to have moved on to silver - a far bigger market. What's being said to stoke the speculation? The price of silver slid from its early highs on Monday. But the metal is up by almost 20% since Wednesday, when messages began circulating on Reddit forums, encouraging users to buy the metal. Coin-selling websites say they are now seeing unprecedented demand and delays in delivering silver. Reflecting the attitude of many of those swapping tips on the site, one user called RocketBoomGo urged fellow traders to ""think about the Gainz"" in a widely circulated post. ""If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP Morgan you'd be destroying along the way,"" they added. However, some on Reddit expressed scepticism, with one saying they had analysed comments and posts on the thread Wall Street Silver and found that 80% ""came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!"" Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that amateur investors would find it much harder to influence the price of silver than they did with GameStop. For one thing, the total value of silver being traded is about $1.4-$1.6 trillion, he said, which is 1,000 times the total value of GameStop's share capital before it became the target of speculation. A large proportion of the silver market also exists ""off-exchange"", meaning it can't be bought and sold as easily online. The army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons. Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too. And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game. The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat. The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it. The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point. Read more here. ""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added. 'Once in a lifetime' GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks. Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm. He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants. ""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock. ""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage."" Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future. ""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. ""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again."" Are the Wall Street giants on the ropes? Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake. However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy. Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports. The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.",Silver prices have hit an a eight-year high after calls to buy the metal on social media sparked a trading frenzy.
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter Fears have been expressed by some in the industry that a breakdown in the current agreement could result in more cash machines charging a fee. LINK - which operates the network of 70,000 ATMs in the UK - said that its commercial model is ""under review"". Some banks are thought to be unhappy about the fees they currently pay. As a result all 38 members of the LINK network are due to have a series of meetings to try to reach an agreement, beginning next week. At the moment around 75% of ATMs are free to use. But Peter McNamara, the Chief Executive of Note Machine, a member of LINK, said that consumers could face being charged at many more of them. ""If the proposals that are being put forward by LINK went ahead, we estimate that you could be losing up to a quarter of the free-to-use ATM sites in the UK,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live. Discussions At the centre of the dispute are the so-called interchange fees. When a customer of one bank uses a cash machine belonging to another bank, the customer's own bank pays a fee to the operator, in the region of 25p. It's thought that banks with a large number of card-holders feel they are being unfairly penalised. ""Some of the very big banks have a lot of cardholders who do a lot of transactions, and they feel that perhaps their share of what they are putting in the pot that pays for ATMs is disproportionate and potentially too high,"" said Mr McNamara. ""They may go outside the LINK mechanism to find a cheaper way of making those machines run, which is the risk in the system that could develop."" LINK said the discussions could take several months. ""We operate in a competitive market and there are other ATM networks in the UK available for card issuers and ATM operators if our model becomes unattractive,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are working hard to avoid this situation.""",The operator of the UK's ATM network has said it is working hard to keep cash withdrawals free for millions of bank customers.
"Customers can now withdraw up to 2,500 rupees a day from cash machines, rather than 2,000, the finance ministry said. Many cash machines are not working because they have not been adapted for the new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes. Long queues at many banks were making it difficult to make withdrawals. The government said Indian banks had received 3 trillion rupees ($44bn; £35bn) of large denomination notes since the move was announced on Tuesday night. The abolition of the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes is intended to crack down on corruption and bring cash worth billions of dollars in unaccounted wealth back into the economy. The two notes accounted for more than four fifths of the currency in circulation and the change threatens to disrupt much of India's cash-driven economy. The government has also relaxed withdrawal limits from banks, removing the 10,000 rupees a day restriction and increasing the weekly limit by 4,000 rupees to 24,000. The Reserve Bank of India urged people not to hoard cash, adding that rupees were available ""when they need it"". It has asked banks to report daily rather than fortnightly the amount of cash withdrawn and exchanged to give a more accurate picture of circulation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged the ""pain"" being experienced by millions but said the scheme was ""not born from arrogance"". ""This hardship is only for 50 days,"" he said in a speech in Goa on Sunday. ""Please, 50 days, just give me 50 days. After 30 December, I promise to show you the India that you have always wished for."" Indians have until 30 December to exchange the now-defunct notes at banks. Since being elected in 2014, Mr Modi has pledged to crack down on ""black money"" kept hidden from authorities. The ""black economy"" could account for about a fifth of India's GDP, according to investment firm Ambit. His political opponents said they would unite to fight the abolition of the high denomination notes, which has made lives difficult for millions of ordinary people - particularly those without bank accounts who keep their savings in cash. Mulayam Singh Yadav, leader of Samajwadi party, called on the prime minister to reverse his decision. ""The government has spread anarchy in the country, the common man cannot buy daily products,"" Mr Yadav said.","The Indian government has raised the limit on cash withdrawals following widespread public anger about the surprise abolition of 500 ($7.60; £5.90) and 1,000 rupee notes last week."
"By Laurence KnightBusiness reporter, BBC News Like the regional savings banks, they are victims of the country's property boom and bust. During the boom years, regional government tax revenues were swelled by stamp duties on property sales, and by income taxes paid by immigrants that came to work on the country's construction sites. The boom was felt most strongly on the Mediterranean coast, where hotels were built for tourists and villas for pensioners and the wealthy. The regional governments also found themselves spending more - on big infrastructure projects, on education for the immigrants' children, as well as on providing increasingly expensive healthcare, especially for the growing elderly population. Then the bust came. Tax revenues - not just stamp duties, but also income taxes and the VAT earned from consumer spending - have collapsed during the recession. Yet the regional governments' spending commitments - health, education, and half-complete construction projects - have not gone away so suddenly. Regional governments grumble that many of these commitments are set by law in Madrid. Catalonia is the most unhappy - its government demands more financial autonomy, while many ordinary Catalans want full independence. The regional governments' collective budget deficits - how much they have to borrow each year to fund their overspending - was 2.9% of Spanish economic output (GDP) in 2011. That was about a third of the 8.5% deficit recorded by the Spanish public sector as a whole (national and regional together), and well above the 1.3% target that had been set by Madrid. This year's target is 1.5% of GDP, but looks just as unlikely to be met. Meanwhile the regional governments have found it near impossible to borrow - neither from the capital markets, nor from their troubled savings banks. An 18bn-euro (£14bn) Regional Liquidity Fund set up by Madrid has already been turned to by five regions for bailouts. Here's a run-down of the main regions to watch: Valencia In July, Valencia became the first region to ask for money from the central government's rescue fund. One of the most financially troubled regions, Valencia's name has become particularly associated with white elephant construction projects - a problem across the country. The Castellon airport, opened in March 2011, has yet to receive a single commercial flight. And critics see the sprawling City of Arts and Sciences - a gleaming complex which was inaugurated in 1998 and added to over 15 years - as a symbol of excess, which they say went three times over budget. Murcia Despite being one of Spain's smallest regions, news that Murcia would join Valencia in requesting a bailout sent the Spanish government's own borrowing cost on financial markets to a record high in July. Like the other Mediterranean coastal regions Murcia has been at the sharp end of Spain's construction boom and bust. Its failure to manage its finances was seen as a worrying portent for its much bigger neighbours. Catalonia Catalonia has become the most pivotal region in the current crisis. It has the biggest economy in Spain, but it also has the biggest debts. Because of their relative wealth, Catalans pay a lot more in taxes to Madrid than they receive via central government spending in return. In effect, some 10% of Catalonia's GDP each year is used to provide financial support to the rest of Spain. On top of that burden, the Catalan government has had to borrow heavily to support its own economy, which has been particularly hit hard by the economic downturn. Catalans consider themselves a separate nation within Spain with their own language, so the government in Barcelona has been reluctant to ask Madrid for a bailout. In the past two years the government instead turned to the patriotism of its own citizens, selling them bonds to finance its budget shortfall. However, this summer Catalonia finally had to ask for 5bn euros from Madrid's rescue fund. The irony that the biggest tax contributor to Madrid's coffers has had to beg for a bailout is a source of great bitterness for Catalans. It has strengthened demands for greater financial autonomy, similar to what the Basques enjoy, and the Barcelona government has called early elections for November, construing it as a plebiscite on the issue. But many Catalans want to go the whole hog, with 1.5 million turning out for a rally demanding full independence in September. The Catalonian president, Artur Mas, has himself called for a referendum, something that would breach Spain's constitution. However, if Catalonia did go its own way, it would leave an enormous hole in Madrid's finances. Andalucia The enormous southern region of Andalucia is the most populous in Spain. It is also one of the poorest - which is ironically something of a blessing in disguise. It has made Andalucia the biggest recipient of net spending by the central government - something that has helped to prop up the region's economy, and that has ultimately been paid for by the much wealthier citizens of Catalonia and elsewhere in Spain. It has helped the regional government keep its own spending under control, and Andalucia has relatively little debt given its size. A lot of central government spending goes on Andalucian unemployment benefits. The unemployment rate in the region has always been among the highest in Spain - a country which as a whole suffers from chronically high joblessness. In the current recession, it has risen to 33% as of March 2012. Youth unemployment was 58%. But Andalucia's dependence on Madrid's largesse also means that it is particularly exposed to spending cuts by the central government. In late September, the region confirmed that it would become the fourth region to turn to Madrid's bailout fund. Castile-La Mancha This central Spanish region, home to Don Quixote and his windmills, has the biggest overspending problem in Spain and a relatively heavy debtload. It came as no surprise when Castile La Mancha became the fifth region to turn to the bailout fund in September. However, the scale of region's problems only came to light after its government changed hands last year. The new centre-right government is pursuing aggressive spending cuts, but has also said it is open to the idea of borrowing from Madrid's rescue fund. In 2009, La Mancha's savings bank became the first of many regional banks to be rescued by Madrid, after it was sunk by bad loans to property developers. As with the savings banks, investors are concerned that La Mancha's regional government may simply be the first to come clean about the scale of its problems. The Balearics One of the most heavily indebted regions, the Balearics has so far rejected any suggestion that it may need a financial rescue. However, the government for the islands of Majorca, Minorca and Ibiza is struggling to pay its creditors. For example, pharmacies have complained that the government still owes them 90m euros of back-payments.",Spain's 17 regional governments are a big part of the country's financial problems.
"The deal, worth $56bn (£33bn) at list prices, was agreed at the Dubai Airshow in November. The agreement includes a provision for Emirates to increase its order by a further 50 aircraft. Boeing plans to start producing 777X planes in 2017, and has set itself a target of 2020 to deliver the first aircraft. ""With the order for 150 777Xs, Emirates now has 208 Boeing 777s pending delivery, creating and securing jobs across the supply chain,"" said Emirates president Sir Tim Clark.

"Official figures show gross domestic product (GDP) grew 0.8% in the three months to December. Most forecasters predicted growth of 0.7% from the quarter before. The release of the data followed a move by the country's central bank on Tuesday to keep interest rates on hold at 2.5%. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has now held rates at their current level for seven months in a row. Economic expansion in the quarter compared to a growth rate of 0.6% for the previous three months, and brings the annual GDP growth rate for 2013 to 2.8%. The figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) suggest that exports and domestic consumption contributed far more to growth than mining - one of Australia's traditional powerhouses. Mining added just 0.1% to growth in the quarter. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy with AMP Capital in Sydney, said other parts of the economy were taking up slack from the mining sector. ""There's a slump occurring in investment, there's no doubt about that as indicated in figures last week, but that's being offset by consumer spending, housing activity and trade,"" he said. Others said the numbers were a bit better than expected, but not enough to move the central bank's current stance on rates. ""There was a good increase in private consumption, up 0.8%, and that combined with exports is the driver of growth,"" said Matthew Johnson, an interest rate strategist with UBS. ""Overall, it's a good quality result but not great... We still think rates are on hold this year."" Recent trade figures from ABS showed the country's current account deficit decreased by 19% in the same quarter. The bureau said exports of goods and services for the period rose by 3%, while imports fell. Housing expansion RBA governor Glenn Stevens remained upbeat about the nation's economy but warned that spending in the resources sector was set to decline significantly. ""Recent information suggests slightly firmer consumer demand and foreshadows a solid expansion in housing construction,"" Mr Stevens said in a statement after the bank's monthly meeting on Tuesday. ""Some indicators of business conditions and confidence have shown improvement and exports are rising. ""At the same time, resources sector investment spending is set to decline significantly and, at this stage, signs of improvement in investment intentions in other sectors are only tentative."" The banks said that growth over time was ""expected to strengthen, helped by continued low interest rates and the lower exchange rate"".","Australia has reported slightly better-than-expected growth for the last quarter of 2013, boosted by exports and domestic consumption."
"A raft of reforms was promised by Portugal's leaders in return for its May 2011 bailout. The visit from the so-called troika will determine whether the country receives its next instalment of bailout funds. It is expected to meet the criteria. The visit was originally expected to take place in July of this year, but was postponed following a political crisis. Fears as costs soar There are fears that Portugal's economy remains volatile, and borrowing costs have climbed again in recent months. The yield on a benchmark 10-year Portuguese government bond soared above the 7% barrier earlier this summer. That is the level at which other European countries have sought a bailout. However, while unemployment in Portugal is amongst the highest in the eurozone, especially amongst the young, the country reported growth of 1.1% for the second quarter of 2013, after a boost to its export market. Portugal received 78bn euros ($102bn; £67bn) in May 2011, in return it began a tough austerity programme. The Portuguese government says it is on track to emerge from the bailout programme in June 2014.","Representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the European Commission and the European Central Bank have begun their latest audit of Portugal's economic health."
"By Daniel ThomasTechnology of Business reporter, BBC News When two new luxury fashion boutiques opened in the Chinese city of Renhuai this summer, it was hard to tell they were fake at first. The storefronts, which appeared to belong to the luxury brands Louis Vuitton and Prada, bore huge photos of models posing with legit-looking products while the shelves were packed with posh handbags and accessories. It was only the misspelled branding that gave the game away. One shop called itself ""Loius Vuitton"", the other ""Plada"". This is the world of intellectual property (IP) theft, which costs European companies alone about €60bn (£52bn) in lost sales each year, according to figures from the EU's Intellectual Property Office. In its most recent survey, 7% of EU citizens said they had intentionally bought counterfeit products in the last 12 months. But critics say this black market stifles the development of innovative young companies and costs jobs. ""There are also strong links between counterfeiting and organised crime and child labour,"" says Alex Newman, an intellectual property expert at law firm Irwin Mitchell. Authorities closed down the fake Louis Vuitton and Prada shops in Renhuai within days, but other big brands operating in China have not been so lucky. In 2016, for instance, Apple lost a trademark fight against a Chinese firm selling handbags and other leather goods using the name IPHONE. China is among a number of countries regularly singled out as a source of IP theft, but businesses say the problem is global. ""We have seen copycats for many decades, first starting in the late 1940s and it is a continuous issue we deal with,"" says Roar Rude Trangbæk, a spokesman for Lego. ""The only difference is that today globalisation means that an issue that was once contained is now worldwide."" The Federation of Small Businesses says 9% of small British firms have had their IP rights infringed on more than one occasion, often by firms operating on UK soil. Typically this involved activities like trademark theft or patent infringement, although copying of products was the most common complaint. Examples include supermarkets producing goods that look just the same as branded ones and even have similar names. In August, for example, family sausage firm Heck and yoghurt maker The Collective both accused Aldi of copying their products. The German discounter says that none of its customers have complained of being misled and it follows ""strict copyright guidelines"", but the two firms are still considering taking legal action. Amelia Harvey, co-founder of The Collective, tells the BBC: ""Their strategy is clear, they're taking cues from other brands and recreating; tricking the consumer into buying something that it isn't. ""As a challenger brand with a small team it's beyond frustrating."" Mr Newman says supermarkets often get away with it by making ""tweaks"" so products aren't identical, ""leaving it open for them to argue that the differences are enough to avoid infringement"". Similar problems beset the fashion industry, where allegations of copying are commonplace. In November, UK retailer Next reached a settlement with fashion brand Scamp & Dude over claims it copied the smaller firm's designs. Next was accused of a ""blatant infringement"" of an animal print top for children, with the garment even appearing to mimic a distinctive logo. ""Often by the time the design rights-holder gets round to doing anything, the accused company will be close to selling through the garments in question,"" Mr Newman says. ""It will then play for time until it can say, 'we've stopped selling this now' which leaves the company alleging infringement reluctant to spend the time and money taking them to court because the likely financial pay-out will often not justify the cost."" To protect themselves, firms should make sure they have registered trademarks and other forms of IP in any country they operate in. But many still do not bother, says Sonali Parekh, head of policy for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB). She blames lack of awareness and concern about the costs. More Technology of Business ""Then there's concern that if you file for a patent you will alert people to your design and they will tweak it then copy it,"" she says. ""But if you do nothing you leave your business even more exposed."" Obvious as it might seem, firms should also tell alleged copyists to stop, although about a third of firms whose IP rights are infringed make no attempt to take action, the FSB says. Mr Newman says this is a mistake. Even if you don't ultimately sue, a legal letter demanding they cease and desist will often resolve the problem without going to court, and may even lead to a financial settlement, he advises. For those operating in foreign markets, familiarising yourself with local IP laws - which vary significantly from country to country - is vital, although places like China are strengthening enforcement. In November, for instance, Lego won 4.5m yuan (£503,000) in damages from Chinese companies that had sold copycat building sets under the name ""Lepin"". At the time the Danish toymaker praised the ""continued efforts of Chinese authorities to protect intellectual property"". ""We don't mind fair competition but unfair competition is bad for the simple reason that consumers are misled and our rights are violated,"" says Mr Rude Trangbæk, who hopes such victories will be a warning to potential copyists. ""Our brand is known for being high quality and consumers need to know what they are buying is real Lego.""","The internet's global reach has made stealing brands' intellectual property even easier, and businesses are losing billions as a result. So what should they be doing to protect themselves?"

"By Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, South Korea The noise of clanging steel echoes up the 60m (197ft) ladder, as heavy switches are tripped, dials monitored and the huge blades outside start their slow circling whoosh. Wind power is becoming increasingly important to South Korea - not just as a way to help meet ambitious targets on greenhouse gas emissions, but also as a way to boost the economy.

""Exports are very important for us,"" explains Joo Hyunghwan, head of Korea's Presidential Committee on Green Growth. ""We are not well-endowed with renewable resources but we need to increase our energy mix. And we want to develop renewable technologies into a strategic export industry."" South Korea is relatively late to the green technology market. Europe is the established leader in wind turbines - and even China is judged to be steaming ahead. Korea completed its first wind farm five years ago. Spread across a beautiful series of hills in Gangwon Province, near the country's eastern coast, the wind farm produces an impressive 240MW per year. But all the turbines here are European. Just a few years ago, when the farm was built, there were no Korean turbines - Korea's big companies hadn't begun making them yet. And now that they have, no-one seems very keen to buy them - even here at home. Foreign advantage Inside the wind turbine's echoing steel frame, the general manager of the wind farm, Kim Hyun-Tae, tells me of his reservations about buying domestic wind technology. ""People say the quality's about the same, but Korean turbines don't have the track record that the European ones do - they haven't really been tested,"" he says. ""If I had to buy more turbines now, I'd buy foreign ones."" A big part of the problem is a lack of space. South Korea simply doesn't have many locations that offer both strong winds and access to install turbines. That makes exports even more important - but without space to test and showcase your products, it's hard to persuade customers to buy them. And if Korean companies can't even interest the domestic market in their products, some say, how are they going to win at the international level? Justin Wu, lead wind analyst for Bloomberg's New Energy Finance, says Korea is starting its wind industry at a difficult time, with falling prices and shrinking demand. But, he says, South Korea firms are also good at ""leapfrogging"" - buying up European expertise, or even European companies, to help them catch up. South Korea, he says, has been in this position before, beating off competition from both Western and Japanese carmakers in the 1980s. One Korean turbine manufacturer, Unison, is even setting up a factory in China to compete with the Chinese for the turbine market there. ""Korea is basically an export-driven country,"" Unison's international head, Ham Bom-sik, says. ""When we developed wind turbines, our main focus was overseas"". The company's exports have got off to a slow start - a couple of projects in Jamaica and the Seychelles, and another order for South America. World beater It seems quite a leap to the government's stated aim of cornering 10% of the global market in renewable technologies by 2020. But if there's one thing South Korea knows how to do, it's export industries. This is the country that grew an OECD economy from a standing start, in 50 years, on the back of industrial exports; the country that gave us brands like Samsung, Hyundai and LG; a country that ignored much of the early advice it was given by Western advisers and rose in already-competitive markets by making things the world wanted to buy. And all that industrial experience - in shipbuilding, steel and semiconductors, for example - has left South Korea with transferable skills particularly suited to making solar panels or wind-turbines. It also left it with strong, well-disciplined conglomerates, tightly knit into the rest of the economy. Conglomerates, says Justin Wu, ""that have a strong desire to move into this new business area"". And now - as a generation ago - the government has offered a crucial helping hand to kick-start Korea's flagship industries. Not just in the form of subsidies and soft loans, but in helping to create domestic demand. According to Mr Joo from the president's Green Growth Committee, the creation of a domestic market for renewables is key to developing the country's exports. ""The two are closely linked,"" he says. ""By creating demand in the domestic market, you generate a test bed, which will pave the way for our wind companies to export their products to the outside world."" The government has said that all utilities companies must generate 2% of their energy from renewables by next year. That figure goes up to 10% by 2022. Domestic champion At one of Seoul's main power plants, renewables director Hong Young-jin shows off the tall wind turbines whirring above a building site. They are building a new coal-fired power plant, he says, to feed South Korea's growing energy needs. But they are also acting as a test bed for wind-turbines from three separate Korean companies, as well as Korean-made solar panels and micro-hydro systems, providing them with crucial, real-life data on their performance. ""Perhaps if we were a private company, we'd see things in purely economic terms,"" Mr Hong explains. ""But we're a public company and we feel we have a role to play in fostering Korean industry."" South Korea has pledged that 11% of its total energy will come from renewables by 2030. It currently makes up just over 2%. Meeting that target, say government advisers, will need more than a token wind farm on the sidelines of Korea's big power-plants. South Korea, they say, will need to push ahead with controversial projects like its first tidal power plant - the world's biggest - completed off the western coast a few months ago. Several more tidal plants are planned. But opposition - from fishermen and environmental groups - has slowed progress to a crawl. Mr Joo says the government is planning to loosen environmental regulations to make it easier for companies to press ahead with renewables. But how loose is a dilemma that goes right to the heart of South Korea's key national strategy: exactly how much green can you combine with growth?",The inside of a wind turbine is an odd kind of place: somewhere between upside-down coal-mine and lighthouse.
"Some 45% of the workload of the Financial Ombudsman Service in the three months to October was made up of PPI cases, new figures show. PPI is supposed to cover borrowers' loan repayments if they fall ill, die, or lose their jobs. Next were complaints about current accounts (11%) and credit cards (10%). Mortgages (4%), overdrafts and loans (3%), motor insurance (3%), and deposit and savings accounts (3%), followed on the list of most-complained about products to the Ombudsman. Clampdown PPI has become highly controversial after years of campaigning by consumer groups against the widespread mis-selling of the policies. They accused banks and other lenders of foisting the insurance on millions of people, even if they could not make a claim under the terms of the policies, did not know what they were buying, or had been told improperly that buying the insurance was a requirement of being offered a loan in the first place. Consequently, complaints have dominated the work of the Ombudsman for some time. It prompted action from regulators, ending with confirmation in October that banks will no longer be able to sell PPI policies when granting loans to customers. Lenders will have to wait seven days before offering PPI to their customers, although a date has yet to be set for implementation of the new rules. In the meantime, the City watchdog - the Financial Services Authority - has taken action against more than 20 firms for mis-selling PPI and has already halted the sale of the policies alongside unsecured personal loans where a one-off upfront premium was involved.",Complaints about payment protection insurance (PPI) continue to dominate a list of financial disputes despite sales rules being tightened.
"This compares with 12.5% last March, according to the Cranfield School of Management. The government has told FTSE 100 companies to have a minimum 25% of female directors by 2015 or else face possible measures. The European Union recently threatened to legislate on the issue. Its Justice Commissioner, Viviane Reding, said earlier this month that ""self-regulation so far has not brought about satisfactory results"" for women. 'Significant activity' The Cranfield report on women in UK boardrooms is being published every six months, and comes in response to the recommendations put forward by Lord Davies in February last year. Cranfield report co-author Susan Vinnicombe, said: ""The past 12 months have seen a significant amount of global activity around diversifying boards. ""After a decade of incremental increases in the UK, we are pleased to be reporting improvements that are more substantive. ""If the momentum we have seen since Lord Davies' review continues we could achieve 30% women on boards in less than four years, which would be a terrific achievement.""","The percentage of women on the boards of the UK's 100 largest-listed companies has risen over the past year to a record 15.6%, a report has said."
"The Turkish Armed Forces Assistance Fund (known as Oyak) says it plans to take over British Steel, which employs 5,000 people, by the end of the year. British Steel owns the Scunthorpe steel works where 3,000 people work and it employs another 800 on Teesside. But the firm was put into compulsory liquidation in May after rescue talks with the government broke down. Another 20,000 jobs in the supply chain were put at risk by the collapse of the talks between the government and British Steel's owner, Greybull, prompting a parliamentary inquiry. The company was transferred to the Official Receiver because British Steel, its shareholders and the government were not able to, or would not, support the business. The news was welcomed by trade association UK Steel. ""British Steel's production facilities in Scunthorpe and elsewhere in the North East represent one third of the UK's steel production and are a major strategic asset to our country,"" the body's general secretary, Gareth Stace, said. ""Their loss would leave our manufacturing, construction and infrastructure capability in a considerably poorer state."" But he called on the government to partner with the steel industry ""to help deliver a level playing field"" by subsidising energy prices and lowering business rates. The Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, described the news as an ""important step"" to secure the future of British Steel. ""The UK has a long and proud history of steel manufacturing and I am committed to a modern and sustainable future for the industry,"" she said. But Ross Murdoch from the GMB union said: ""Our members are staring redundancy in the face as uncertainty continues to hang over the company. ""This dedicated and loyal workforce must not be an afterthought amidst all of the speculation,"" he said, adding that they were put in the position ""through no fault of their own"". Steelworkers' union Community said the deal was ""hugely encouraging"" and an ""important milestone"". ""As we have said from the outset, we believe the business must be kept together and the future of steelmaking at Scunthorpe secured,"" said the union's general secretary, Roy Rickhuss. ""We will want to be assured that Ataer has a long-term strategy to invest in the assets and develop the business going forward."" Exclusive rights The Official Receiver said it had received ""several"" bids for the firm, but described Ataer, Oyak's investment arm, as its ""preferred buyer"". Ataer's accountants have exclusive rights to the insolvent firm's books, so that they can examine the state of its finances. ""Following discussions with a number of potential purchasers for the British Steel group over the past few weeks, I am pleased to say I have now received an acceptable offer from Ataer,"" the Official Receiver said, adding that the focus was now on finalising the sale. ""I will be looking to conclude this process in the coming weeks, during which time British Steel continues to trade and supply its customers as normal."" Ataer owns nearly 50% of Erdemir, Turkey's biggest steel producer, which employs 11,530 people. Together, Ataer-owned companies make about a quarter of Turkey's steel, making it the third-largest producer in Europe, according to the firm's site.",Turkey's military pension fund has reached a tentative deal to buy British Steel out of insolvency.
"The FSA said it had found ""serious failings"" in the sale of the products , designed to protect firms taking out loans against rising interest rates. The FSA said it had reached agreement with Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS over providing ""redress"". The mis-selling is the third case of serious malpractice at the UK's banks. This comes after manipulation of lending rates and the PPI insurance mis-selling. The FSA said it believed the swaps had had a ""severe impact on a large number of these businesses"". It did not say how much money would be necessary to compensate the businesses involved. Sandy Chen, from Cenkos Securities, estimated that the total cost to the banks collectively would be between £1.1bn to £1.4bn, with most of that falling on Barclays. Around 28,000 interest rate protection products were sold to thousands of small businesses, starting in 2001. The businesses affected should now be contacted by their bank to instruct them whether they are included in a review of these sales. Those which were found to have been the victims of mis-selling will eventually be offered compensation. The banks all released responses in the wake of the FSA announcement, saying they had co-operated with the FSA and would continue to work with it to resolve the matter. They said they had agreed to carry out a thorough assessment of sales of these products to certain customers. Lloyds said that it had not sold these types of products widely, and therefore was not expecting the costs of redress to be substantial. Assurances The managing director of the FSA's conduct business unit, Martin Wheatley, said the practice had been costly for the victims: ""For many small businesses this has been a difficult and distressing experience with many people's livelihoods affected,"" he said. He added that the bosses of the banks, including Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond, had given a personal assurance they would sort out the problems caused. The FSA has been investigating whether mis-selling took place for two months, and as part of that has been talking to some 100 businesses. When Parliament debated the subject last week, the Aberconwy MP, Guto Bebb, said many business people did not understand the deals but trusted their bank managers, and many were told that without signing up they risked being refused credit. 'Beg and borrow' Waheeda Bashir runs a halal butchers in Ilford, Essex, and approached Barclays in 2006 for a loan to expand her business. The 35-year-old said that she requested £1.45m to buy neighbouring properties and said she was told she had to take an interest rate protection product otherwise she would not get the loan. As a result she said she has ended up paying £7,926 a month for the 25-year loan, but then an additional bill of £19,000 every three months for 32 years to pay off the rest of the complex deal. ""It is a rope around our neck. We have had to sell all the jewellery that my mum and dad gave to us. It has taken all our life earnings,"" she said. She said that she hoped the situation would be dealt with as soon as possible in the light of the FSA's findings. ""We have had to beg and borrow from friends. Business is hard but we are pushing along,"" she said. Another person who said he had been affected was Michael Barltrop, 59, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, who said that an exit from one of these deals eventually cost him £200,000. ""It has left us completely short of money and caused a lot of stress,"" he said. Others have claimed that the extra bill that they have faced had led to their businesses collapsing. Swaps products vary in their complexity and the FSA said some of these can be appropriate when sold in the right circumstances. But it said it had found a range of poor practices including: The FSA will now contact other banks which sold interest rate hedging products to see if similar mis-selling practices went on. These additional institutions were responsible for only a small proportion of the sales, the FSA said.","The Financial Services Authority says banks mis-sold specialist insurance, known as interest rate swaps, to thousands of small businesses."
"Oliver Schmidt, 48, is the second person to be imprisoned in the US over the diesel emissions scandal. Volkswagen first admitted in September 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat US emissions tests. The scandal has cost it almost $30bn. US prosecutors say Volkswagen installed special software in certain diesel vehicles that allowed them to perform better during emissions tests than they did under normal driving conditions. VW emissions cheat bill hits $30bn Volkswagen: The scandal explained VW papers shed light on emissions scandal Diesel cars: What's all the fuss about? The emissions were sometimes 30 times higher than permitted under US rules. Volkswagen sold almost 600,000 vehicles with the devices in the US between 2006 and 2015, and about 11 million globally. The allegations have also prompted probes in other countries and led to arrests in Germany. 'I made bad decisions' Mr Schmidt, who led the firm's environmental and engineering office in Michigan, learned of the cheating scheme in 2015, according to court documents. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violating the Clean Air Act in August. His attorney had urged the court to deliver a lesser punishment, saying he had played a minor role in the scheme compared to more senior people at the company. But Michigan-based US District Judge Sean Cox sentenced Mr Schmidt to the maximum sentence proposed by prosecutors, who had already dropped some charges against Mr Schmidt in exchange for the guilty plea. ""I made bad decisions and for that I am sorry,"" Mr Schmidt said in court on Wednesday, according to Reuters. Mr Schmidt, a German national, is one of eight current and former VW officials charged in the US in the diesel emissions scandal. James Liang, a former engineer, was sentenced to more than three years in August.","A former Volkswagen executive has been sentenced to seven years in prison and a $400,000 (£298,778) fine, after admitting he helped the firm evade clean-air laws."
"Tesco said the horsemeat scandal had a ""small but discernible impact"" on frozen and chilled convenience food sales. Like-for-like UK sales, excluding petrol and VAT, dropped by 1% during the 13 weeks ending 25 May 2013. Tesco said it would cut back on its range of consumer electronics goods. The firm added it was making the change as electronic goods ""take up a lot of space and don't make much money"". It plans to refocus, selling more home items, cooking products and clothes, which take up less room in its stores and can be sold for a higher profit. 'Huge changes' In April, Tesco reported its first fall in annual profits for 20 years, and also said it was exiting its US chain Fresh & Easy, which had never made a profit, at a cost of £1.2bn. The retailer is undertaking a programme of store refurbishments and is planning to refit almost 70 of its larger outlets. ""Our plan is a long term project,"" chief executive Philip Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We're not helped by the huge changes we're making to general merchandise, which is all about changing the space and the ranges for the future."" ""We have dramatically reduced our ambitions to grow big stores,"" added Mr Clarke. 'Awkward questions' During the horsemeat scandal, traces of horsemeat were found in four of Tesco's own-brand meat products. The company has since introduced new safeguards to ensure food quality, and said that sales of frozen and chilled convenience foods had picked up in recent weeks. In February, Tesco pledged to bring meat production ""closer to home"" and work more closely with British farmers in response to the horsemeat scandal. It introduced a new testing process, and chief executive Philip Clarke said that all chickens sold in UK stores would come from British farms by July 2013. Matt Piner, research director at retail consultancy Conlumino said: ""Despite only having a small number of affected products, the retailer was very much at the centre of the negative fallout from the scandal."" ""Whereas Sainsbury's and Morrisons were able to spin the episode into a positive, highlighting their product quality and supply chain transparency, for Tesco it merely raised some awkward questions and damaged shopper perceptions of the Tesco brand,"" he added. Tesco's online business continued to grow, and the retailer said its internet sales outperformed growth in the market as a whole. It said it had improved the quality and availability of food offered online, and it now had 169 ""Click & Collect"" grocery collection points across its UK store network. Tesco said consumers in its international markets faced ""challenging conditions"", especially in Europe. In China, sales have been affected by the bird flu crisis and a drop in demand for pork products after a food safety scare in the country.",Shares in Tesco have fallen over 5% after the supermarket giant reported a drop in UK sales over the past three months.

""Of course we are affected,"" he said, ""but we are not badly affected because we are not 100% in oil. ""We are a fully diversified company. So today if oil is doing [badly] it doesn't mean we are doing [badly] and that's the good thing about diversification.""

"QE is the Bank's scheme to boost the economy by buying bonds. In February, the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) boosted the stimulus to £325bn. Rates have been 0.5% for three years. Data on Thursday showed a shock 1% fall in manufacturing in February, with other research showing the overall economy has barely grown this year. A monthly economic estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (Niesr) suggested output grew by 0.1% in the first three months of this year, after no growth in the three months to February. It said this implied the UK has avoided a technical recession - two consecutive quarters of negative growth. The central bank itself has said that the UK is unlikely to enter recession this year, forecasting growth of about 1% in 2012. But the Bank's governor, Sir Mervyn King, has warned that the economy will ""zig-zag"" between growth and contraction throughout the year. Niesr said it expected to see the economic recovery take hold in 2013. But it added that the depression - defined by it as a period when the economy is below its peak - would continue until 2014 before it hit the level of activity reached at its peak in 2008. 'Difficult call' The decision to leave the size of the asset purchase programme unchanged was widely expected, given that the latest extension of QE runs until May. ""The focus therefore remains on whether further asset purchases will be announced next month,"" said Ian McCafferty, chief economic adviser to the CBI business group. ""It's a difficult judgement call, but on balance we're not expecting a further extension next month. Recent economic data has been more encouraging, and with oil prices high, there's now less certainty around how far and how fast inflation will fall."" The research consultancy, Capital Economics, said that while it did not expect an extension to QE next month , it still thought the MPC would undertake more purchases in time. Despite Thursday's disappointing manufacturing data from the Office for National Statistics, other recent surveys have painted a more encouraging picture of the economic recovery. The Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) suggested that both the manufacturing and service sectors picked up in March. The BBC's economics editor, Stephanie Flanders, describes the data as being ""all over the place lately"". ""But the underlying message has not changed: the recovery is still fragile, and so is the optimistic mood we have seen in global financial markets since the start of 2012,"" she says. In addition, the Bank of England may have to contend with high levels of inflation in the coming months. Inflation measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) eased to 3.4% in February from its peak of 5.2% in September. The Bank has forecast that it will be back to its target 2% by the end of the year. But at its last meeting in March, it warned that high oil prices could slow the global and UK recovery and drive up inflation. Lowering inflation is seen as key to the recovery as it will help alleviate the squeeze on consumers and lead to a rise in spending.",The Bank of England has continued to hold UK interest rates at 0.5% and announced no change to its quantitative easing (QE) programme.
"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News It said the move was prompted by its recent pay gap report showing men on average earned 43.8% more than women. The company said recruitment was one of the areas it was looking at as a way to narrow the gap. PwC also plans to ban all-male interview panels and examine how ""career defining roles"" are awarded. Making sure that ""everybody in the firm"" had access to important career opportunities such as working on big projects or for well known clients, would be ""a real game changer"", said PwC's chief people officer Laura Hinton. She said the move was part of the firm's wider plan to improve the diversity of its workforce, which includes looking at the attitude of senior management. It also has a returnship programme, which encourages those who have taken a break from work, such as maternity leave, to do six months paid work experience. The company has also started to allocate ""progression coaches"" - usually partners - who will work with women and ethnic minorities employees to help develop their careers. The Daily Mail, which first reported PwC's decision, said it was the first of the big four accountancy firms to ban all-male shortlists. 'More common' Jill Miller, policy adviser at the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD), said it did not have data on the number of firms which had banned all-male shortlists for jobs, but said it was becoming ""more common"". She said new rules forcing firms to publish their gender pay gaps had increased transparency and focused leaders' attention on how to improve the figures. However, many firms were failing to exploit the data they had on their workforce, she said, such as when and why women were leaving the firm. ""It's important to look at as wide a talent pool as possible. Overall it's about levelling the playing field and getting best person for the job."" PwC's decision comes amid a furore over diversity at the Bank of England, which recently appointed a male economist to its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee despite a shortlist of four women and one man. The Treasury said the role had been awarded on merit. Ms Hinton said that hiring diverse people at a senior level was ""a real challenge"" because candidates tended to be ""disproportionately male"". Improving diversity at graduate and school-leaver levels was easier because the firm had more control, she said. For example, it had found that male graduates tended to apply for graduate placements earlier on in their university career. As a result, rather than filling up their assessment centres on a first-come first-served basis, it makes sure each centre has a 50/50 split between male and female applicants. ""Little things like that can stack up against women,"" she said. ""The challenge is making sure that at every stage in the process we are saying yes to get the right person and not excluding. The objective is to keep pushing and to encourage others to do the same.""",Accountancy giant PwC has banned all-male shortlists for jobs in the UK in an attempt to increase the number of women in senior roles at the firm.
"Mr Luckey was closely associated with the rise to prominence of Oculus and its VR headset which finally went on sale in early 2016. Facebook, which owns Oculus, gave no details about why Mr Luckey left the firm or what he planned to do next. His departure caps a troubled period for Oculus which lost a $500m (£400m) court case against media firm Zenimax which said it stole trade secrets. The court case was partly brought about because Zenimax accused Mr Luckey of violating a non-disclosure agreement he signed with the firm in 2014. Facebook and Oculus have appealed against the damages award. No speech ""Palmer will be dearly missed,"" said Facebook in a statement given to tech news site Ars Technica.

No personal statement from Mr Luckey about his future plans has yet appeared. Mr Luckey had been the public face of Oculus since 2012 and regularly gave presentations at industry events about VR's potential. However, he became a controversial figure last year when it emerged that he had partly bankrolled a group behind a social media campaign helping Donald Trump's presidential bid. Widespread criticism of his involvement with the pro-Trump group prompted Mr Luckey to apologise for the effect the revelation had had on perceptions of Oculus.

"The transaction would be for a stake of up to 15% in the three-time winners of the Rugby World Cup. New Zealand's national treasure burned through nearly half of its cash reserves last year during Covid-19 lockdowns. New Zealand Rugby has since been looking at other sources of funding. The All Blacks are New Zealand’s most recognisable sporting team and are one of the best-known brands in international Rugby. The team won the Rugby World cup in 1987, 2011 and 2015, but lost to England in the semi-final of the 2019 world cup in Japan. The talks with Silver Lake were first reported by Sky News, which said the deal for a 15% stake would value the team at about $2bn (£1.5bn). Sky said a deal had not been concluded, but could be announced as soon as this month. Burned through cash In November, New Zealand Rugby (NZR) chief executive Mark Robinson told the New Zealand Herald that it had burned through 47% of its NZ$86m (£44m) cash reserves in 2020. NZR was on track to earn revenue of NZ$100m when the sport was suspended during a national lockdown. Silver Lake describes itself as a “global technology investment firm” with approximately $75bn in combined assets under management. However, it has invested in a number of sporting ventures, including City Football Group, which owns Manchester City FC, as well as sports teams in the US, Australia, Japan, Spain and Uruguay.

"Properties were still selling and being newly listed until the start of the restrictions on 23 March, when, among other things, the government urged people not to move house. However, sales have continued since then, although at much lower levels. Sellers have not been taking their properties off the market, Zoopla said. The number of homes for sale - per estate agent - is only 1% lower than it was on 7 March. Zoopla's research and insight director Richard Donnell said: ""There has been no mass withdrawal of homes from the market as agents and consumers adopt a wait-and-see approach. ""The closure of estate agency branches and general uncertainty has resulted in far fewer sales agreed in the last two weeks, with less new supply coming to the market.""

The bank said the agreement resolved ""one of the most significant remaining pieces"" of housing market-related litigation against the firm. ""This settlement... represents an important step in helping restore stability to our broader mortgage market and moving to bring back the role of private firms in providing mortgage credit,"" said FHFA director Melvin Watt in a statement. Banned from business Separately, Bank of America settled a lawsuit brought by New York's attorney general in 2010. That suit, which was filed against Bank of America as well as the bank's former chief executive Kenneth Lewis, alleged that Bank of America failed to disclose losses at Merrill Lynch prior to the bank's acquisition of the firm. In hiding these losses, New York's attorney general alleged that Bank of America misled shareholders about the purchase. To settle the suit, Bank of America agreed to pay $15m and adopt certain corporate governance changes. Additionally, Mr Lewis agreed to pay $10m, and said he will accept a three-year ban from working at any public company as part of the settlement. The firm said that it has now resolved around 88% of the total cost of pending litigation relating to the bank's conduct during the housing crisis.",Bank of America agreed to pay $9.5bn (£5.7bn) to settle charges it misled US mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the housing crisis in 2008.
"The Dow Jones plunged nearly 1,500 points or more than 5.8%, while the S&P 500 fell 4.9% and Nasdaq fell 4.7%. The declines pushed the Dow more than 20% below its recent high, a threshold that often accompanies a recession. The falls come as the virus's spread has the global economy reeling. Concerns about the disease have disrupted manufacturing, prompted widespread closings and cancellations, and kept people at home. On Wednesday, UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak unveiled a £30bn package, while the Bank of England delivered an emergency cut in interest rates. However, the White House and Congress have yet to reach a deal for economic relief after President Donald Trump's proposal of a tax cut for workers failed to garner widespread support. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Wednesday said that the administration hoped to extend deadlines for tax payments, cover the cost of sick leave for staff forced to stay home and provide loan guarantees for affected industries, such as airlines. ""We are not only focused on the health issues, but the economic issues,"" he said. The New York branch of the US central bank also said it would inject money into the financial system by making more overnight loans available to banks, its second such move this week. The Fed last week made its first emergency rate cut since the financial crisis in an effort to keep money flowing. The moves come as the spread of the virus, despite hopes of containment, has rapidly reset expectations for global growth this year. On Wednesday, economists at IHS Markit said global growth was likely to slow to 1.7% this year, down from the 2.5% it forecast last month. The firm warned that the outbreak was likely to push Europe, which was already experiencing low growth, into recession and reduce US growth to 1.8%. ""The global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is the single biggest risk facing the world economy in early 2020,"" the firm said. Earlier, London's FTSE 100 slid 1.4%, while European indexes saw more modest declines. Those falls follow several weeks of market turmoil. The 20% decline of the Dow has pushed it into bear market territory, ending a streak of gains that started in 2009. ""It is not the virus itself, but rather the fear and panic related to the virus and the associated altered economic behaviour that could be a damaging tipping point, forcing the global economy onto a darker path,"" said Katrina Ell, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics. Markets have also been slammed this week by a plunge in oil prices, after oil exporters said they would increase output rather than make coordinated cuts. On Wednesday, oil prices were down more than 3%. On the Dow, the biggest drag was US planemaker Boeing, which fell more than 18%. The firm has been in crisis since the crashes of two of its 737 Max planes, which have since been grounded globally for about a year. On Wednesday, it reported 46 cancellations, which were not made up by new orders. It is also reportedly freezing hiring and being forced to draw on a $13.8bn (£10.7bn) loan, in part because of the coronavirus.","Share markets in the US plummeted on Wednesday, with losses accelerating after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic ."
"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC News For the first six months of 2019, the number of thefts of catalytic converters jumped to 2,894, compared to 1,674 thefts for all of 2018. In a car's exhaust system, catalytic converters clean up harmful gases before they exit the exhaust pipe. In a video seen by the BBC, a criminal gang stole a catalytic converter in under three minutes in broad daylight. The prices of certain precious metals have skyrocketed in the last 18 months - palladium is now worth £1,300/oz, while rhodium goes for £4,000/oz, according to FJ Church and Sons, a specialist metals merchant that is also the UK's largest specialist in recycling catalytic converters. The police urged vehicle owners ""to be vigilant"" and consider taking safety measures to protect their cars. How the theft works A catalytic converter is located in a box on the exhaust pipe under a car. In order to steal it, thieves slide under the car and use high-powered cutting tools to detach the box from the pipes around it. Although there are 10,000 different types of converters, the cars that are most often targeted are hybrid vehicles. Since hybrid cars have two power sources - electric and petrol or diesel - the catalytic converter is used less frequently to process pollutants. The metals are less likely to corrode, meaning they are worth more and thus attractive to thieves. Precious metals must be used because the converters have to work efficiently enough to meet emissions standards. What can we do about it? The police has advised that vehicle owners consider taking the following safety measures: Carmaker Toyota is very concerned about the thefts, and says it is ""doing all [it] can"" to support its customers who have been victims of crime. Besides consulting with the police and offering customers safety tips, Toyota has developed ""Catloc"", a device which makes it harder for thieves to detach the catalytic converter from the bottom of the car. ""Although 'cat theft' is not new, or limited to Toyota products, it has always been comparatively rare; however, the recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months,"" said a Toyota spokesman. Toyota does not make money when replacing stolen catalytic converters in cars, and it is also bearing the cost to discount the Catloc device for its customers, while it researches more anti-theft technologies, the BBC understands. Honda has a different take on the matter - it says that Honda Accord and Jazz models from 2008 onwards come with a tray under the car to make it harder for thieves to get at the catalytic converter. And in car models from 2015 onwards, the catalytic converter has been placed within the engine bay, so a thief would need to disassemble the car to get at it. Cracking down on scrap metal yards Dafydd Dylan, commercial manager of the catalytic converters division at FJ Church and Sons, told the BBC that his firm is constantly receiving calls from members of the public asking how much they could get if they were to sell catalytic converters from car models such as Totoya Prius, Honda Accord and Honda Jazz. ""We do what we can to discourage it - we don't purchase any units from these models unless they come from a reputable dealer,"" he said. He added that there were also ways to tell if suppliers were trying to sell stolen goods: ""When we get a packet, usually there will be a range of low-end and high-end catalytic converters in it. ""We have refused to work with some suppliers for certain packets containing a disproportionate amount of high-grade scrap converters."" However, although it has been illegal to pay cash for scrap metal since 2013, he says there are some dealers who will pay cash for catalytic converters, which tempts the thieves. ""The police needs to start to put people in jail for paying cash for scrap metal - as soon as they do that, the trade would slow down and stop,"" he said. The British Metals Recycling Association agrees: ""It is unlikely that any stolen catalytic converters will enter a BMRA member yard due to 'know your customer' checks. ""However, there will be yards that operate illegally, willingly take stolen material and pay cash for it. There will also be no record of the transaction. This is due to the lack of enforcement of the Scrap Metals Dealers Act 2013 and its complementary legislation in Scotland, The Air Weapons Licensing Act 2015.""","There has been a huge rise in catalytic converters being stolen from cars in 2019, police in London say."
"Sterling fell about 1% across the board. The only currency against which it gained ground was the Turkish lira. The Prime Minister told Sky News on Sunday that she wanted the best possible deal for leaving the EU. However, she dismissed the idea that the UK could ""keep bits of membership"". She added: ""We're leaving. We're coming out. We're not going to be a member of the EU any longer."" Commentators interpreted this as meaning that Mrs May would not seek to keep the UK in the EU's single market, with radical consequences for the country's economy. 'Populist politics' By Monday evening, the pound was down 1.05% against the dollar at $1.2155, while against the euro, it was 1.41% lower at €1.1501. ""Sterling is on the back foot on Monday after Theresa May's comments were taken as a sign the UK government would prioritise immigration controls over single market access,"" said Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. ""Domestic populist politics trumps the trade card for now, it seems, and that is weighing on the pound."" Mr Wilson predicted ""more volatility"" in the sterling exchange rate, adding that it could easily ""bounce back"" as the tone of political discourse shifted. HSBC currency strategist Dominic Bunning agreed: ""[Mrs] May saying that it's not about keeping 'bits' of the EU suggests it's not going to be about keeping access to the single market. ""She said we will have full control of our borders, and given what the other side of the debate - the EU - has said, that's not compatible with full access to the single market, free movement of capital, free movement of goods and services. ""That's the direct trade-off that the [foreign exchange] market is looking at."" Inflation rising Paresh Davdra, chief executive of RationalFX, said: ""The looming fears that the UK might exit the single market continue to weigh down on the pound, and we expect the volatility to continue until further and actual on-ground clarity emerge. However, he added: ""All is not lost for the UK, as the fall in the pound's value has attracted international market activity and simultaneously boosted the country's export figures."" The pound fell sharply in the immediate aftermath of the UK's June 2016 vote to leave the EU. The weaker pound makes UK goods cheaper for buyers overseas, but increases the cost of imported goods. Analysts expect UK inflation to pick up this year as the impact of higher import costs feeds through to the economy. Last week, a string of economic surveys indicated that companies were facing rising price pressures as import costs increased. November's Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation rate was 1.2%, up from 0.9% in October and the highest since October 2014, when it stood at 1.3%.","The value of the pound has fallen to a two-month low against major currencies after Prime Minister Theresa May signalled the UK would pursue a so-called ""hard Brexit"" from the EU."
"The supermarket giant and the UK's largest food manufacturer had been locked in a battle over wholesale prices. Unilever had wanted to raise its prices by about 10% to compensate for the steep drop in the value of the pound. But Unilever had to give some ground, the BBC understands. Brands including Hellmann's Mayonnaise had been removed from Tesco's website. ""Unilever is pleased to confirm that the supply situation with Tesco in the UK and Ireland has now been successfully resolved,"" Unilever said. ""We have been working together closely to reach this resolution and ensure our much-loved brands are once again fully available. For all those that missed us, thanks for all the love."" Tesco v Unilever live updates Retailers warn over Brexit price rises Unilever and Tesco at loggerheads What do we know about Brexit? 'Marmitegate' explained A Tesco spokesman said: ""We always put our customers first and we're pleased this situation has been resolved to our satisfaction."" Tesco had earlier on Thursday halted online sales of top-selling goods produced by Unilever such as Persil washing powder, Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Marmite yeast extract spread. The BBC understands that those products should be available on the Tesco website again in the coming days. Supermarket chain Asda said it too had successfully negotiated with Unilever. An Asda spokesperson said: ""We pride ourselves on having famously low prices for customers every day and work tirelessly with our suppliers to keep prices low"". Bruno Monteyne, a former senior Tesco executive who is now an analyst at Bernstein, said Tesco has typically one to two weeks' stock. ""While politicians can deny reality, a shampoo produced on the continent is now more expensive,"" he said. ""This isn't about Tesco or Unilever, but about all UK retailers and suppliers."" Supermarkets frequently renegotiate supplier prices, but it is unusual for a dispute to be made public. Sterling has dropped by about 16% against the euro and 19% against the dollar since the UK's vote in June to leave the EU. The sharp drop has left suppliers and retailers dealing with the effects of higher bills for imported goods. Unilever is the UK's biggest grocery manufacturer, but as many of its products are made outside the UK, it had argued it should be getting more. Supermarket profit margins have already been squeezed by a long-running price war as the big established retailers try to stem the loss of market share to discounters such as Lidl and Aldi.","Issues surrounding the supply of leading brands including Marmite to Tesco have now been resolved, Unilever has said."
"The letter in the Sunday Telegraph, signed by 38 bosses, said two-thirds of venues ""couldn't open outdoors from 12 April, and none is breaking even"". Signatories urged the government to allow indoor dining to go ahead from 17 May in England. The letter also warned against the introduction of vaccine ""passports"". A government spokesperson said: ""We cannot be complacent or lose sight of the risks this virus poses."" Chief executives of Mitchells & Butlers, Fuller's, Young's, JD Wetherspoon, Pizza Hut and Alton Towers owner Merlin signed the letter, which said: ""We must be driven by data not dates. ""The data say it is safe to confirm now the reopening of indoor hospitality on 17 May and the lifting of all social-distancing restrictions on hospitality on 21 June,"" it added. ""This is vital as government support for hospitality tapers away then, and without it many businesses will be unviable."" However, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Dr Susan Hopkins from Public Health England said that two to three weeks of data was needed before the impact of outdoor service in England from 12 April could be determined. ""As we release restrictions and as people start moving around again, transmission can occur. So people still need to take precautions as they do that,"" she said. She added: ""We really hope the next step can take place as planned."" According to data from CGA and AlixPartners Market Recovery Monitor, only 23% of English venues have been able to open for outside trade. Vaccine 'passports' Executives at the Wahaca restaurant chain and Burger King were among the signatories who said that vaccine passports cannot be used as an excuse to ""derail"" the earliest possible date for lifting of all social distancing measures in June. The government said on Saturday it is reviewing whether to use vaccine certificates and ""no decisions have been taken"". Government ministers have previously said that certificates would allow people to show if they have been vaccinated, had a negative test or had natural immunity from a confirmed infection in the previous six months. It comes after local government secretary Robert Jenrick called on council leaders in England to work with pubs, cafes and restaurants trying to reopen safely. Mr Jenrick wrote to councils on Thursday, warning them against applying Covid-19 rules ""disproportionately"" and threatening to punish pubs for failing to ensure social distancing outside. ""It is in the public interest that local residents can socialise in a licensed and controlled environment outside, where Covid-19 risks are lower,"" he wrote. On Saturday, the UK recorded 2,206 new Covid cases and 35 deaths, according to the latest government figures. A spokesperson for the Department for Business said: ""We are continuing to make good progress in tackling the virus, with case rates and hospitalisations down and more than 42 million vaccine doses have been administered. But they said people must not be ""complacent"" about coronavirus. They added: ""That is why we must continue to take a cautious and irreversible approach to reopening and monitor the data ahead of each step of the roadmap."" They also pointed to the Pubs Restart Scheme, offered as part of a package to help hospitality firms reopen.","The UK's biggest hospitality firms have signed a letter urging the prime minister to ""stick"" with England's roadmap to reopen the economy."
"It came despite production hurdles due to a global shortage of computer chips that has also hit other carmakers. Mr Musk said the chip shortage caused ""supply chain challenges"", although that ""particular problem"" had eased. Profits for the first three months of the year were $438m (£315m), up from $16m last year, bolstered by sales of Bitcoin and environmental credits. But the profits were dented by a $299m payment to Mr Musk as part of a controversial compensation plan struck in 2018. Revenue rose to $10.4bn, from $6bn in the same quarter last year. Mr Musk claimed Tesla's Model 3, its midsize sedan, was the ""best-selling luxury sedan of any kind in the world"" for the quarter. He also predicted the company's midsize sport utility Model Y would become the best-selling car or truck of any kind in the coming years. ""We've seen a real shift in customer perception of electric vehicles, and our demand is the best we've ever seen,"" Mr Musk said. The company said the Model Y had so far received a strong reception from consumers in China, where Tesla began manufacturing last year. China is possibly the world's most competitive market for electric vehicles, with hundreds of manufacturers vying for a slice of the growing market. Bitcoin move However, not all of the company's revenues came from selling cars. The company bought $1.5bn of Bitcoin during the first quarter, but then cut its position by 10%, which contributed $101m to its revenues. Tesla recently made it possible for customers to purchase the cars in Bitcoin, allowing it to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency. ""It is our intent to hold what we have long term and continue to accumulate Bitcoin from transactions from our customers as they purchase vehicles,"" the company's chief financial officer, Zachary Kirkhorn, told investors. Tesla also earns credits for exceeding emissions and fuel economy standards and then selling them to other carmakers that fall short so they can avoid penalties. The company earned $518m from sales of those credits in the first quarter, an increase of 46% over the same quarter in 2020. Tesla said it delivered roughly half a million cars in 2020, and 185,000 in the January-to-March period. The company expects its deliveries to increase by 50% annually, and is ramping up production at its existing facilities in California and Shanghai while it builds its new factories in Berlin and Texas. Tesla is the world's most valuable car company, with its share price pushed higher by investors betting on strong growth in electric vehicles in the coming years. However, the company makes far fewer cars than companies such as Toyota and Volkswagen, which each sold more than nine million cars last year. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said that despite the generally positive results, there could be problems ahead. ""There's the complete lack of guidance around near-term production headwinds,"" he said. ""A global shortage of computer chips is expected to limit production from all manufacturers in the immediate future, and Tesla won't be exempt. Given the ongoing importance of its production ramp up, it may even be more heavily impacted."" And despite Tesla making a profit from sales of Bitcoin, Mr Hyett said there were many sceptics: ""Tesla has made some $101m on its investment so far, which is all well and good, but huge gains and losses aren't really what corporate treasuries are all about. ""Investors could well argue that if they wanted to have exposure to Bitcoin they would have bought some themselves and don't need Tesla to do it for them. ""Still Tesla has never played by the rules - so far that hasn't stopped it being a winner.""",Elon Musk's Tesla made a strong start to the year with profits up and record deliveries of its electric cars.
"The International Energy Agency lifted its demand forecast for next year and raised its projections for consumption to 2015, citing stronger US growth. The IEA now expects oil demand in 2011 to rise by 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd), some 260,000 bpd more than previously forecast. Crude prices hit $90 a barrel this week, the highest for two years. The Paris-based IEA, which advises governments on energy, said the recent price spike was most likely due to a rise in consumption in the third quarter of 2010 from the US and Europe. It also raised its estimate for daily demand in 2010 by 2.5 million bpd, about 130,000 bpd more than previously forecast. The IEA report said: ""Although economic concerns remain skewed to the downside, not least if current high prices begin to act as a drag on growth, more immediately demand could surprise to the upside."" According to its medium-term projections, the IEA said world oil demand for 2009-2015 would grow by an average of 1.4 million bpd each year, higher than its previous forecast made in June. Oil prices have hovered in the upper-$80s this week, and reached $90.76 a barrel on Tuesday. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) meets on Saturday to discuss its official production quotas, although analysts believe output will remain unchanged. However, the IEA said that Opec may come under pressure next year to boost supply.","Oil demand will be higher than expected in 2011 as global economic recovery speeds up, according to a report."
"The Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the sector rose to 49.2 in August, but stayed below the 50 level, which indicates contraction. The index was up from July's figures of 45.9, its lowest for seven years. However, the Brexit vote was still the main factor weighing on activity, the report said. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, said: ""Construction firms cited a nascent recovery in client confidence since the EU referendum result and a relatively steady flow of invitations to tender in August. ""However, the latest survey indicates only a partial move towards stabilisation, rather than a return to business as usual across the construction sector. ""There were still widespread reports that Brexit uncertainty had dampened demand and slowed progress on planned developments, especially in relation to large projects."" Ahmed: The economic bounce back David Noble, group chief executive at the Chartered Institute of Procurement & Supply, added that the weak pound had pushed up purchasing costs for the sector ""at a rate not seen for half a decade"". ""Firms reduced their purchasing volumes as a result, as new orders and activity continued to fall - though at a more moderate rate compared to last month,"" he added. Industry recession Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that ""construction will continue to struggle until business confidence improves"". He said the downturn in construction ""looks likely to continue for several quarters to come"" due to protracted Brexit negotiations and long lead times for any major public sector projects arising from investments announced in the Autumn Statement. Official figures last month showed the industry had fallen back into recession for the first time in four years. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said construction output dropped by 0.7% in the second quarter, following a 0.3% fall in the first quarter, meaning the industry recorded two consecutive quarters of negative growth for the first time since 2012. Markit's construction figures come ahead of its PMI for the UK's dominant service sector due out on Monday.","The UK construction industry showed signs of recovery in August, contracting less than in July, a survey has suggested."
"But the figure was below expectations and the economy is still 9.2% smaller than before the pandemic struck. It marked the fourth consecutive month of expansion following the slump induced by the coronavirus lockdown. However, growth in August was slower than the expansion seen in both June and July. In June, the economy grew by 8.7% and in July, by 6.6%. Eat Out to Help Out, which ran from Monday to Wednesday during August, offered 50% off food up to the value of £10. Discounts for more than 100 million meals were claimed through the scheme. What is likely to happen next? Analysts said the coming months were likely to see growth slackening further because of new Covid restrictions, the end of the furlough scheme in October and concern over a no-deal Brexit. ""We have been clear that we stand ready to do more as necessary,"" a Treasury spokesperson said. ""Some firms will be affected by coronavirus for longer than others, and we will continue to seek to support these firms appropriately."" Should we be worried? The economy's bounce back from the pandemic shutdowns slowed in August, despite the boost from Eat Out to Help Out at a time when there were few social restrictions. The official technical recession - two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP - has certainly ended and that will be confirmed next month. But a lower than expected figure for growth in the economy in August raises fears about the recovery petering out and even going into reverse in the current final quarter of the year. The figures bolster the argument of those business groups campaigning for further support, particularly as social restrictions are strengthening rather than weakening. The first stage of that came from Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Friday afternoon. The Bank of England will also react at its policy-setting meeting next month. But the latest figures show that while the first bounce in the economy occurred relatively rapidly, a full recovery is going to take much longer and not yet assured. It's going to be a tough winter. What does the bigger picture look like? The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said important sectors of the economy, such as services and construction, were still considerably smaller than in February. The ONS also issued figures for the three months to August, showing growth of 8% over the period compared with the previous three months as lockdown measures eased further. ""The economy continued to recover in August but by less than in recent months,"" said Jonathan Athow, the ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics. ""There was strong growth in restaurants and accommodation due to the easing of lockdown rules, the Eat Out to Help Out scheme and people choosing summer 'staycations'. However, many other parts of the service sector recorded muted growth. ""Construction also continued its recovery, with a significant boost from housebuilding."" He added that there was ""limited growth"" in manufacturing, with car and aircraft production still much lower than the start of the year. What are the experts saying? No V-shaped recovery here,"" was the verdict of Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, referring to optimistic forecasts of a swift rebound in growth. ""GDP was still a hefty 9.2% below its pre-Covid February level in August - when no meaningful restrictions on economic activity were imposed."" Looking ahead, he predicted growth of only about 2% in September. He added: ""GDP also likely will struggle to improve on September's level over the next three months, as the second wave of Covid-19 instils more consumer caution and compels the government to shut hospitality businesses in Covid-19 hotspots once again."" Sarah Hewin, economist and head of research at Standard Chartered Bank, echoed that view. ""Despite the support from Eat Out to Help Out and staycations, there was virtually no growth in manufacturing,"" she told the BBC. ""And although we continue to see new housing being built, that also was a little bit weaker than expected, so the pace of recovery does seem to be slowing. ""To a certain extent, that's not surprising. We had very strong growth in June and July as lockdown restrictions eased, so August data continued to show the economy growing, but not at such a fast pace. ""The slowdown in that momentum, though, does give us some concern for what might be happening over the next few months."" What has the political reaction been? Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Today's figures show our economy has grown for four consecutive months, but I know that many people are worried about the coming winter months. ""Throughout this crisis, my single focus has been jobs - protecting as many jobs as possible and providing support for people to find other opportunities where this isn't possible. This goal remains unchanged."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said: ""It is deeply worrying that growth was weak in August despite the easing of restrictions, especially as we now face Covid-19 cases rising and more areas coming under local restrictions. ""The government must get a grip on test, trace and isolate, reform the sink-or-swim Job Support Scheme and urgently put in place consistent economic support for areas of localised restrictions.""","The UK economy continued its recovery in August, growing by 2.1%, as the Eat Out to Help Out scheme boosted restaurants."
"By Zoe ThomasBBC Business reporter, New York But there is increasingly an alternative option on people's nightly menus - meal kits sent out to homes in the post. Helping breathe new life into dinner or lunchtime, meal kits supply pre-measured ingredients and full recipe instructions, which aim to help make the process of cooking at home as simple as the 1950s fantasy. The industry - which has its roots in Sweden - had $1bn (£702m) in global sales in 2015. And this is expected to increase to $5bn over the next 10 years, according to consulting firm Technomic. Big players like US firms Blue Apron and Plated, UK businesses Gousto, and Germany's Hello Fresh, have done a lot of the ground work, educating consumers and getting them comfortable with the idea of ordering measured ingredients that they cook themselves. Now smaller, niche players are getting in on the act, offering specific meal kits tailored to particular dietary preferences, food styles and health trends. Food style Purple Carrot has taken the vegan approach. Andrew Levitt launched the brand in 2014 in the suburbs of Boston after learning about the benefits of a plant-based lifestyle. Mr Levitt, like most of his customers, is not a vegan, though he eats mostly fruit and vegetables. After two decades working in the pharmaceuticals industry he was inspired to change direction by a TV documentary ""Forks Over Knives"" that focused on how a plant-based diet can help improve people's health. Mr Levitt and his wife began testing recipes in their kitchen at home, making sure they were all ""kid approved"" by their three young children. They also gave prototype kits to their nanny to test how easy they were to use. The company's focus has struck a chord with home-cooks looking for an easy way to whip up vegan dinners. It now has 18 full-time employees, and early investors have given the company $4m to try and help it dominate its particular niche. Last year, Mark Bittman, a former food writer for the New York Times, joined, helping to expand the company's range of vegan recipes. Mr Levitt admits the firm has benefitted from a lack of vegan-focused competition. ""If Purple Carrot does its job right we will have all the space around plant-based meal kits,"" he says. Subscription model Dishes made from meal kits cost on average $11 (£7.50), slightly higher than buying ingredients at the store. But as the companies explain, shipping pre-measured ingredients cuts waste - grocery stores do not sell a tablespoon of soy sauce. For most meal kit providers though, the customers do not shell out for an individual meal, they pay for weekly or monthly subscriptions. Mr Levitt says the subscription model makes it easy for customers, and guarantees sales for the business. Yet Kyle Ransford, founder of California-based Chef'd, has rejected that idea and instead allows users to order one-off meals. ""The problem with the subscription is if you like something you can't order it again,"" he says. ""We think the consumer doesn't want to be slotted into this system."" The ""a la carte"", one-off orders model has been tried by others. Plated - the second largest meal kit service in the US - initially offered both one-off orders and a subscription service, but eventually dropped the former. ""The move to purely subscription was a logical step in enabling Plated to become a core part of our customers' weekly dinner routine, and has been an important factor in our growth,"" says Aamir Basheer, vice president of retention and loyalty at Plated. But Mr Ransford, who would not disclose Chef'd sales, believes pre-set menus will eventually turn users off. Baked As users have become used to meal kits they aren't just buying ingredients for a savoury main course. Red Velvet NYC is the brainchild of two sisters who grew up in a culinary-focused family. The company sends everything needed to make tarts, sweet pies or cakes at home. ""I grew up with a love of good food,"" explains co-founder Agathe Assouline-Lichten, whose father was a specialty food importer. After a decade in marketing she decided to turn that love into a business and help people overcome the challenge of whipping up luxury desserts at home. ""It's one thing to have a party with a spread of cheese and crackers, it's another to pull a homemade dessert out of the oven,"" she says. Ms Assouline-Lichten launched her New York business in September as an a la carte service charging $24-$30 per dessert. She plans to expand to a subscription model this summer, sending baking kits once a month. ""I wanted a proof of concept,"" she says, and adds that she now plans to start looking for private investors. As the business has developed it has expanded the products that it sells, and it now offers pans, whisks, and even birthday candles. Ms Assouline-Lichten says Red Velvet is trying to capture the celebration aspect around baking, and make the process as seamless as possible. Health kick The overall meal kits sector markets itself as healthy because the food is fresh and prepared at home. But some companies have taken that one step further, focusing on specific diet trends. New York-based Green Blender sends boxes of fresh ingredients that customers blend into smoothies at home for a subscription price of $49 a week. Amir Cohen - who started the business with his girlfriend Jenna Tanenbaum in 2014 - says the company is focused on being a health brand rather than a meal kit company. But their concept is the same. ""We found that when people were making a health change they saw it as a chore,"" says Mr Cohen. He explains that sending out Green Blender's smoothie ingredients and recipes helps ease the process of living a healthy lifestyle, much like ordering meal kits for dinner makes cooking at night much less hassle. As people become more comfortable with the meal kit ordering concept the jump to ordering all sorts of foods to prepare at home is likely to only grow further, forever changing what it means to be a home chef.","You know what it's like. You get home after work exhausted, the fridge is empty, and before you know it you're dialling the number of your nearest takeaway. Cooking at the end of a long day can be overwhelming."
"Germany's biggest lender did not give any details about the legal bill. However, the bank is expected to be hit with fines resulting from a number of investigations by regulators in the US and the UK. It added that it expects to be profitable in the quarter and will report near record quarterly revenues on 29 April. Deutsche Bank set aside €3.2bn at the end of 2014 in litigation reserves. At the same time it outlined another €1.9bn in potential risks and indicated it faced an additional €4.8bn in mortgage repurchase claims. Regulators are looking into allegations that the bank was involved in the rigging of benchmark interest rates, including Libor. It has also been probed over alleged attempts at manipulation of the foreign exchange market and over alleged violations of US sanctions on Iran. US and UK regulators may announce a settlement with Deutsche Bank as soon as Thursday, Reuters reported.",Deutsche Bank said it expects litigation costs of €1.5bn in the first quarter.
"The call by the CBI chiefs comes amid a government-commissioned review which could lead to all or part of the high-speed rail network being scrapped. The CBI regions were the East Midlands, West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, London, the North East and North West. They said HS2 will bring benefits ""far beyond its costs"". The statement claimed a scaled-back version of the controversial project ""will not deliver the improved connectivity across the country that businesses are crying out for"". It continued: ""HS2 will bring benefits to local communities far beyond its costs. It will create half a million jobs, stimulate house building along its route and support much-needed investment across the Midlands, North and beyond. ""It is the critical spine that will bring wider transport improvements like Northern Powerhouse Rail and the Midlands Rail Hub to life."" Northern leaders have also published a review recommending that the North and Midlands must take control of plans for a high-speed rail network in their areas. 'Damaging delays' The Northern Powerhouse Independent Review called for the establishment of a body named HS2 North, which would be at arm's-length from the government and be overseen by Transport for the North to ensure HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail are combined efficiently. Chris Oglesby, chief executive of Manchester-based property firm Bruntwood and a member of the panel which oversaw the review, said: ""Our review panel proposes that the North and Midlands must take control of the nation's high-speed network. ""HS2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail - a major priority of Boris Johnson and his government - are completely interlinked and a joined up approach is required to both and the upgrades to existing lines. ""Only by delivering an integrated high-speed network right across the North can a Northern Powerhouse vision be truly realised. Further delays and uncertainty are hugely damaging to the North and the country as a whole."" Over budget A review into whether to scrap HS2 was launched by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in August and is due to be completed shortly. It is being led by Douglas Oakervee, a former chairman of HS2 Ltd - the taxpayer-funded firm building the railway - with Lord Berkeley acting as his deputy. Recent figures compiled by HS2 Ltd show the railway could be delayed by up to seven years and run £26bn over budget, reaching a cost of £88bn. Phase 1 of HS2 is planned to run between London and Birmingham. Current designs involve a second Y-shaped phase launching in two stages: Phase 2a from the West Midlands to Crewe followed by phase 2b from Crewe to Manchester, and Birmingham to Leeds.",Six regional heads of Britain's biggest employers' group have urged the government to build the controversial HS2 rail project in full.
"The world's biggest mobile phones and TV maker said it expects an operating income of 4.1tn won ($3.8bn; £2.5bn) for the three months to September. That is below analysts' expectations for earnings of 5.2tn won. The South Korean company will publish full financial results later this month. Samsung's mobile division, its biggest business, has been struggling to maintain its dominance against rivals such as Apple and Chinese smartphone-makers Xiaomi and Lenovo. Its flagship Galaxy smartphone line has been losing market share to cheaper models that also have large screens and multiple features. The firm said quarterly sales amounted to 47tn won, which was below analyst estimates for 50.3tn won. ""Smartphone shipments increased marginally amid intense competition,"" Samsung said in a statement. ""However, the operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price."" The company also said it is ""preparing new smartphone line-ups featuring new materials and innovative designs, as well as a series of new mid-to-low end smartphones"". Samsung shares rose about 1.6% in Seoul despite the weak profit outlook. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology editor Samsung has been the standout success of the smartphone era - certainly in terms of building market share, with the South Korean firm overtaking Nokia to become the world's leading phone manufacturer. It is still holding on to the number one spot, but competition at both the top and budget ends of the market is now exerting an intense pressure on its profits. Samsung still has around 25% of the market, down from 33% a year ago, but a trio of Chinese firms Lenovo, Huawei and Xiaomi have rapidly grabbed a big slice. It was the whole Galaxy range which propelled Samsung's profits ever higher and phones like the latest Galaxy Note 4 still get glowing reviews. But it hasn't managed to pull off the same trick as Apple, which continues to charge luxury prices and make chunky profits on its new phones. The recent launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus is a case in point - analysts say Apple's profit margins have come down but are still above 40%. Samsung is struggling to keep prices up at the high end, and with smartphones now becoming a commodity product it's failing to match its Chinese rivals' prices for similar phones. The competition is only going to get more intense - and it isn't clear how the Korean giant can respond. Chip plant Samsung announced on Monday that it would spend about $15bn on a new semiconductor plant in South Korea, to meet the growing demand for memory chips. It is set to be the biggest single investment in a chip factory, and construction will begin in the first half of next year with operations due to start in 2017. Samsung is a major chip supplier to other electronics firms, including major rival Apple. Samsung is also facing some pressure at its consumer electronics division, which makes televisions, air conditioners and other appliances. Sales and overall profit are forecast to have dropped because currency fluctuations made Japanese-made rival products cheaper to buy. The Korean won strengthened about 3.5% against the Japanese yen in the third quarter.",Samsung Electronics has forecast a 60% fall in quarterly operating profit from a year ago because of slowing Galaxy smartphone sales.
"The company, which owns the Blacks and Millets brands, said like-for-like sales in its outdoor business rose 10.2% in December. This helped lift overall group like-for-like sales for the six month to end-December to a decline of 0.1%. Blacks is in talks with parties interested in buying all or parts of the business. In October, Blacks had announced it had received several takeover approaches. In its latest trading update it said talks over these were ""on-going and a further announcement will be made in due course"". However, the company said that it expected to return to profit if the acquisition talks fail. Blacks' shares were up 5% to 42p in morning trading. 'Turnaround programme' Blacks came close to administration in 2009 before striking a rescue deal with creditors . As part of restructuring plans, Blacks has closed many of its loss-making stores, leaving it with about 300 outlets. Total sales in the period from 28 August to 30 December were £85.4m, down from £95.8m in the same period last year, reflecting stores closed in the restructuring programme. Although like-for-like sales were down 0.1%, Blacks said margins were better than in 2009. Chief executive Neil Gillis said: ""The group has performed strongly during the key Christmas trading period highlighting the strength of our offering in what continues to be a challenging retail market. ""The turnaround programme remains on track and we enter the New Year in a positive financial position and focused on continuing to deliver the benefits of the turnaround strategy,"" Mr Gillis said.

"The Federal Statistical Office revised October's unemployment number from 6.7% to 6.6%, November's figure was also 6.6%. Both figures were adjusted for seasonal variation. Meanwhile inflation fell to its lowest rate in nearly five years in November. Official figures showed inflation dropped to 0.5% in November from 0.7% in October. Strong labour market The fall in the number of unemployed was larger than analysts' expectations, down 14,000 to 2.872 million, the Federal Labour Office said. The figures are in marked contrast to many other economies in the eurozone. Economists have warned of a potential economic ""stagnation trap"" in the euro area. However, analysts said that record employment, rising wages and low interest rates are helping to prop up domestic demand in Germany. ""Germany's buoyant labour market continues to underpin wage growth and thus private consumption, in combination with very low inflation,"" said Christian Schultz, economist at Berenberg. Deflation risk Inflation remains weak in the eurozone and economists say the rate in Germany could fall further. ""Looking ahead, the recent drop in energy prices - if sustained and if not offset by strong currency weakening - could push German headline inflation further down,"" ING Bank analyst Carsten Brzeski said. Low German inflation may put pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to further stimulate the eurozone economy, Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said. ""With inflation set to remain far below target in the eurozone's largest and arguably strongest economy, the ECB will remain under intense pressure to provide more policy support."" The ECB has started buying covered bonds and asset-backed securities to try to revive the eurozone economy and keep deflation at bay.","Germany's unemployment rate has hit a record low, but slower inflation has raised concerns over deflation."
"Stephanie FlandersFormer economics editor Mr Osborne will be glad for the support, even if critics will say the Bank governor should not be publicly opining on fiscal policy. It's fair to say the chancellor's not getting much help from anyone else - or the UK economy. Today's August public finance numbers are a case in point, with another record amount of borrowing for that month. So far the deficit is running more than 20% higher than last year and well above the Office for Budget Responsibility forecast. This is getting increasingly difficult to explain with ""special factors"". (The big special factor this time - sales of Olympic tickets - meant more money for the Treasury, not less.) We're used to hearing Labour politicians say that the coalition's deficit policies have failed. But lately, many others have been saying the same thing. Here's the basic problem, neatly summarised in the opening paragraphs of a recent report by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS). ""The Coalition came into office in 2010 with the stated aim that it would eliminate the current structural deficit within five years and stem the increase in public debt as a proportion of GDP. The Coalition is not achieving these aims."" As the CPS point out, both the prime minister and the chancellor like to boast that they have cut the overall budget deficit by a quarter. But that is not the borrowing target the coalition set itself. The central target was to eliminate the current structural deficit - that's the borrowing which is not for investment and not expected to go away naturally - with economic growth. That measure of borrowing has fallen by only 13% - or roughly an eighth - since the coalition came to power, from 5.3% of GDP to 4.6% of GDP. That is a much worse sound bite for Prime Minister's Questions. You might labour under the misapprehension that government spending has been ""cut"" (as the CPS highlight in their note - many do). It hasn't. It has continued to rise in real terms, in large part because debt interest payments have risen. The fall in the overall deficit has been entirely due to cuts in capital investment and increases in taxes. ""You don't need to be Keynesian"", say the authors, ""to think these would be more damaging to growth than front-loading current expenditure cuts."" (In case you were wondering, the Centre for Policy Studies was co-founded by Margaret Thatcher.) What went wrong? Well, we know that growth has been much slower than expected and - crucially, for the government - the OBR decided, in the last Autumn Statement, that we were not going to get back a lot of the output we had lost. As I explained at the time, that one decision almost took the government back to square one when it came to cutting the structural deficit. Public sector pay But there's more to this story - described in painful but fascinating detail by Brian Reading in a new report for Lombard Street Research. Among other things, Mr Reading is a former economic adviser to Ted Heath and ex-Economics Editor for the Economist. The funny thing is, if you look simply at the spending side of the ledger, the coalition has been strikingly successful: public expenditure in 2011-12 came in £5bn lower than planned. That undershoot was largely due to lower-than-expected spending on social security payments, which departments cannot easily control (though the Secretary of State for Welfare and Pensions would say he has helped to keep unemployment down.) But ministers have also over-delivered when it comes to squeezing administrative budgets. These have been cut by more than 40%, not a third, as Mr Osborne planned. As Mr Reading notes, this cut helped make possible a £17bn increase in non-administrative spending, which sounds like good news for front line services. So, you can see why Mr Osborne might be feeling rather put-upon. On the face of it, the coalition has more than delivered on spending restraint, while allowing extra funds to flow to the ""frontline"". Yet the right are lambasting the chancellor for failing to cut spending, and the newspapers are full of stories of core public services being squeezed. Oh yes, and he's in danger of missing key fiscal targets, and borrowing so far this year has been higher than in 2011-12. What gives? The answer, in a nutshell, is public sector pay and tax revenues. One reason we haven't noticed the ""extra"" money flowing to the front line is that it has been swallowed up by pay rises, which, in turn, have meant much, much bigger-than-expected cuts in public sector employment. Since 2010, the number working in the public sector has fallen by 300,000 more than the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted. Why? Because pay has risen three times faster than expected - by 9% instead of 3%. But wasn't there a pay freeze, you might ask? Yes, but as the Financial Times reported recently, at least six government departments, plus the NHS, the Police and the Armed Services, have been unable to impose it. Many civil service contracts require annual pay increases for staff, in line with their seniority and length of service. In most cases, departments decided those legal requirements trumped the freeze. With such a massive overrun in pay, the only way to meet the cash spending plans was to cut numbers instead. Two-thirds of the losses have been in local government - which helps explains why many people feel their ""frontline services"" are indeed being cut. Brian Reading cites the example of Devon and Cornwall police, which recently admitted it had investigated only 34% of reported crimes in 2011 - down from 40% in 2010. The chief constable blamed the loss of 700 officers. Likewise, the National Audit Office has found that ""the UK border agency has so far cut personnel by 1,000 more than planned as part of the programme to save £350m between 2011-15."" Rightly or wrongly, many of us will feel we have seen the consequences of that this summer. Poor design? Mr Reading believes the failure on public sector pay speaks to a general failure to focus on the right things in designing the deficit strategy. Like most economists, he believes the coalition should have thought more about the impact on growth in thinking about where to cut. (Note we are talking about how to distribute the pain, here, not whether to have it all.) He is particularly damning of the coalition's decision to go along with Labour's planned one-third cut in net public investment over five years. As he notes, this was always a bit strange, given that borrowing for investment was explicitly excluded from Mr Osborne's deficit target. ""If the government had believed its own fiscal mandates, it would have cut capital expenditure less quickly or even increased it to offset the damage from current spending cuts. Neither the current budget balance nor net debt would have been increased."" Mr Reading says the poor design of the plan contributed to its own failure by needlessly hurting growth. Mr Osborne would disagree. So, perhaps, would Sir Mervyn King. But there is no argument that slow growth has hit tax revenues - and that, in turn, has almost certainly led to a situation in which Mr Osborne is either going to have to abandon his promise to have the stock of debt falling in 2015, or announce fresh spending measures or tax rises for the next two years. The original plans had tax revenues rising nearly £70bn in the first two years of the programme, public investment falling £20bn, and public spending rising by around £50bn. In fact, both investment and current spending have come in below target, as I mentioned earlier. But by April of this year that had been more than outweighed by a £14bn shortfall in revenues. As a result, overall borrowing in 2011-12 was nearly £10bn higher than hoped. And, as we have seen in these latest public finance figures - the trend so far this year has been in the wrong direction. These are the hard realities, which will almost certainly look worse in the December Autumn Statement. The IMF doesn't want Mr Osborne to react by announcing more tough medicine to meet his debt target. Nor, apparently, do many in his own party. Now Sir Mervyn King has told him he does not have to. No doubt, the chancellor is relieved to hear it. But he'd be forgiven for also feeling pretty depressed at the reaction he is getting to the first two years of Plan A.","The governor of the Bank of England seemed to let George Osborne off the hook on Thursday night, in his TV interview for Channel 4, when he said it would be OK for the chancellor to miss his debt target because of slow economic growth."
"By Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News With three months to go before the big day, the online retail industry is gearing up for a huge surge in demand. It's warning that firms may struggle to cope if we leave all our festive shopping till the last minute. ""We think the volumes are going to be really very excessive this year,"" said Andy Mulcahy from IMRG, the industry body for online retailers. ""Whilst that in itself is not a problem, getting too much of it too close to Christmas is going to be a bit of a problem,"" he said. ""If you can spread out your shopping and do quite a lot of it in November, maybe even a bit of it now, then that would really help."" Even before lockdown, online sales in the first months of 2020 were roughly 5% higher than last year. 'No need to panic buy' But since Covid-19 hit, the numbers have soared, with growth rates of around 40-50%, according to IMRG. And they've remained high ever since. ""At this point, I think we can expect an increase of at least 30% for the peak festive trading season, but if stores have to close this might push to 50%, "" Mr Mulcahy thinks. But he stressed that here's no need for shoppers to panic buy - as there's still plenty of time before the big day. So how will retailers and logistics companies manage this huge potential uplift in the run up to Christmas? ""It's been like Christmas for the last six months for us,"" said Mike Hancox, the boss of delivery firm Yodel. It is one of the UK's biggest parcel couriers handling more than 150 million packages a year. But it had to adapt quickly in March, even partnering with taxi firms at one stage to help deliver the extra packages. Yodel's now preparing for a period of sustained demand this autumn and winter as shoppers flock online for convenience as social distancing restrictions remain in place. It's adding 2,500 self-employed drivers and nearly 500 staff in its sorting centres across the UK to bolter its operations. ""We think it will be the biggest online Christmas ever, by some way,"" Mr Hancox said. ""Certainly at Yodel it will be our biggest ever year. We're planning for success and I think every other delivery carrier will be expecting the same."" He's planning on handling a million extra parcels in the busiest week. But with rising unemployment and uncertainty over future coronavirus measures, many families may feel less able or willing to spend. The boss of Boots, Seb James, admits he ""just doesn't know"" what demand will look like - but there are three things he does feel sure about. ""Firstly, it will be much more online, so we've tripled our online capacity,"" he said. ""The second thing is people are going to be much more anxious about money so value is going to be much more important this Christmas. ""And the third thing is that everyone has to shop safely... we won't be able to cram people in as we normally do at Christmas, we have to be very careful,"" he said. One of its new safety measures will be bookable out-of-hours shopping slots for customers over 60. Boots is also going early with some festive ranges, which are already in stores. Mr James says this was in response to customer demand. ""I think people are planning ahead and they're right to do so. Last minute cramming is just not going to work... we hope that people will spread out their shopping."" John Lewis's online Christmas shop opened in August after a spike in searches by customers. And it has already seen a surge in sales for some products. The company says sales of trees were up 233% at the end of last week, compared with the previous year. Christmas decorations, meanwhile, were up 156%. Who knows how jolly this festive season will be. But one thing seems clear, it will be the most digital one yet for shopping.",Shoppers are being urged to buy early this year for online Christmas gifts.
"By Fiona GrahamTechnology of business reporter, BBC News Beatrice Nderango is the headmistress of Gakawa Secondary School, which lies about 10km from Nanyuki, a market town in Kenya's rift valley, not far from the Mount Kenya national park. The school is situated in a village that has no phone line and no electricity. The people that live here are mostly subsistence farmers. ""We don't really have a cash crop, but the farmers do a bit of farming,"" says Mrs Nderango. ""They grow potatoes, a little bit of maize, but we don't do well in maize because of the wild animals. They invade the farms."" Although Kenya has fibre optic broadband thanks to the Seacom cable, most of rural Kenya is not connected and until now getting online would mean travelling to town. But all of this is changing, thanks to technology that uses the unused parts of the wireless spectrum that is set aside for television broadcasters - the white spaces. The colour of television The project is part of the 4Afrika Initiative, an investment programme being announced by technology giant Microsoft, that also includes a new Windows Phone 8 smartphone for the region and investment in help for small businesses on the continent, and in education and internships. For the white spaces project, the company is working with a Kenyan ISP, Indigo Telecom, and the Kenyan government. The ISP is installing wireless 'base stations' - or masts - that are solar-powered, to get round the lack of mains electricity. The base stations act as a link to the nearest main cable connection to the internet, without the expense of extending the fibre-optic network. The signal supplied is much more powerful than normal wifi. ""What we are calling TV white space, that is just a different set of frequencies. It is between 400 megahertz and about 800 megahertz, and those radio frequencies will just go further,"" says white spaces expert Professor Robert Stewart of Strathclyde University. ""They can go through walls, they will kind of bend around hills, they will give you much better connectivity. And of course, that's why the TV guys chose that in the first place."" Local schools, a healthcare clinic, a government agriculture office and a library have been connected in the first part of the pilot. Ms Nderango says internet will benefit teachers and students alike. ""Students will now be introduced to e-learning, they will be able to carry out the assignments, they'll be able to do a lot of research,"" she says. ""To add to that, there is the exposure to the rest of the world."" And she believes the wider community will benefit as well. ""It will change lives, because on the internet you can access information about skills. ""The farmers for example will improve their skills, and learn entrepreneurship."" Business networking Microsoft's Fernando de Sousa says getting rural areas online is a crucial part of making them economically viable. ""There is... a commercial responsibility that both private and public sector have across Africa to bring technology and bring access that can then drive economic growth, economic development and sustain employability, especially outside of the metropolitan areas,"" he says. ""It is going to significantly increase the ability for innovation and the great ideas that Africans have to actually reach markets and become available for use by consumers... I think that there is a fantastic opportunity for Africa to showcase its own capabilities in the world because of the increased access."" The next step is to open the network more generally to the business community in the area. ""The commercial viability of actually deploying white spaces on a broad spectrum across the communities, is something that is very important... because a. it can't be a subsidised service; and b. it is not a private government or community network,"" says Mr de Sousa. ""It really needs to be a commercially viable network. Bringing small businesses online and enabling them to use the technology is very, very important."" This is not the first time that TV white spaces have been used in this way - in the UK pilots are underway on the Isle of Bute in Scotland and in Cambridge. In the United States, Wilmington, North Carolina, has a white spaces project in place, and the Air.U partnership hopes to connect rural college campuses. There are several test beds around the world. More is planned. In Africa, Google is sponsoring a project in South Africa that will connect 10 schools in the Western Cape for six months, that will launch soon. There are obstacles: in many countries this part of the spectrum is licensed, and the way it is used is changing as television services move to digital. National and international regulators are looking at how to allocate space, to avoid having competing services trying to use the same space. For now, and probably in the long term, TV white space networks will be complementary to fibre-optic broadband rather than a replacement. But Strathclyde University's Prof Stewart, one of the men behind the pilot on the Isle of Bute, thinks that for remote rural areas it may be the most cost-effective option. ""If we find that rural communities in developing or developed countries can access this without significant expense, then it will make a difference,"" he says. ""It is not going to solve all the problems. It is not for everyone. But it will solve problems for some folks.""","""This is the greatest achievement I can say for this school. [The students] are finding it a great favour that they should be the first school in Africa to have this kind of a project. It is very exciting. They wonder how they got there."""
"By Jon DouglasReporter, You & Yours Tui, owner of Thomson and First Choice, was fined 48 times during 2015 and 2016 by the travel association Abta. The breaches included inaccurate advertising and sending holidaymakers to resorts where significant building work was being carried out. Tui said it was committed to resolving any issue a customer experiences. The figures, compiled from industry data by You & Yours on Radio 4, show Tui's most recent fine of £1,500 was imposed in December 2016 for cancelling a customer's travel arrangements after the holiday had already been paid for in full. Many of the other fines were for failing to respond quickly enough to correspondence. However, three of them were for not telling customers about significant building works at their resorts before they went on holiday. Abta's code of conduct states customers should be told about building work in advance, or offered alternative travel arrangements or a full refund if the alternative would constitute a significant alteration to their holiday. Despite being fined, Tui has continued to send some holidaymakers to building sites without warning. 'Unbelievable' In November 2016, Keith Parkins from Guildford in Surrey went to Tenerife with Tui's company Thomson. He arrived to find significant construction work underway at his hotel. ""The arrival was, to put it bluntly, a shock,"" he said. ""Coming down the hill, the first thing you could see was the long sun terrace, digger, bulldozer, piles of rubble, workmen, wheelbarrows, you name it. Inside, most of the hotel was taped off. The very first morning, I was woken up after 07:00 by the horrendous racket of pneumatic drills. It was just unbelievable."" Thomson has offered Mr Parkins a £250 refund or a £345 travel voucher. He thinks it is insufficient, as he paid £1,762 for his holiday and is not keen on travelling with the company again. Other firms fined for breaches of the Abta code include Tui's biggest rival, Thomas Cook. It was fined on 24 occasions during 2015 and 2016, often for failing to deal with customer's complaints or for not paying arbitration awards on time. In total, it was charged £10,750. Tui was fined a total of £38,500 over the same period. ""You really need to look at the percentage of problems you are seeing in terms of the total number of people they take away,"" said Sean Tipton from Abta. ""If it is just a one-off problem, obviously that's not good enough for you as the holidaymaker, but it doesn't necessarily represent a systemic problem with the company."" In a statement, Tui said the vast majority of its customers have a ""great holiday"", adding: ""We are sorry to hear if a holiday falls short of expectations or is impacted by circumstances, which are sometimes beyond our control. We remain committed to resolving any issue a customer experiences."" Thomas Cook said: ""We aim for zero breaches of the Abta code and we continue to improve the business and put our customer at the heart of everything we do."" ""We would like to see no breaches of the code as well,"" said Abta's Sean Tipton. ""The point is, when they do occur, it is essential the tour operator does their best to address it straight away, or if it is not resolved satisfactorily, then people should come and tell us about it.""",The UK's biggest tour operator has been repeatedly fined for failing to stick to the travel industry's own code of conduct.

She said the firm had tried to claim it didn't know anything about it - ""Mike Ashley's even accused us of planting it ourselves, it was totally bizarre."" Sports Direct, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under fire after BBC and Guardian investigations uncovered working practices at the warehouse which MPs later described as being akin to a Victorian workhouse. Concern about working conditions led to Sports Direct's founder Mike Ashley being called to give evidence to MPs.

"""It is not OK for taxpayers to bail out banks,"" Mr Diamond told a Treasury Committee hearing. On bonuses, he said that Barclays ""paid for performance, not for failure"". The government has called on banks to pay smaller bonuses, with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urging them to be ""sensitive to the public mood"". Mr Diamond said that Barclays had yet to decide on bonus payments to its staff for this year. He added that the ""majority"" of the amount paid in bonuses went to investment bankers, rather than staff in the retail banking arm. ""We are sensitive, we are listening [to calls for restraint], and there is no lack of effort in recognising the importance of this issue and being responsible [over bonuses],"" he said. He said that Barclays had ""no intention of paying more in bonuses than is necessary"". However, he said the bank had to balance these responsibilities with ""the environment we operate in"", referring to the fact that if Barclays were to unilaterally reduce bonuses, top staff could leave to join competitors. He said he had waived his bonus for the past two years but would wait until he was offered one this year before deciding whether to accept it. Lending more While he said he was grateful for the support given to the banking sector from central banks and governments, he stressed that Barclays had not taken any direct support from the taxpayer. The UK government has pumped billions of pounds into the banking sector and has bailed out both Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, while the Bank of England has also injected billions into the economy through its quantitative easing programme. ""No bank should be a burden on the taxpayer - we have to make the system safer,"" he said. Mr Diamond also said that his bank was committed to lending more to help the economic recovery in the UK, and that it was time to move on from widespread bank-bashing. ""There was a period of remorse and apology for banks - I think that period needs to be over,"" he said. ""We need our banks willing to take risks, be confident and work with the private sector in the UK, so that we can create jobs to improve economic growth."" However, when pressed he would not give an idea of how much Barclays intended to lend this year. ""In 2009, we lent £35bn more [than the previous year] and in 2010 we lent £35bn more again in the first nine months alone,"" he said. ""Lending is what we do. We like to lend."" But he said the bank needed to lend responsibly, with proper risk management in place. Lending too freely had contributed to the financial crisis, he added. Banks are under pressure from the coalition government to lend more to businesses to help them through the downturn. Mr Diamond said the major banks were in discussions with the government about lending targets for next year. He also reiterated Barclays' intention to remain based in London. He said the city had numerous benefits, including the time zone, a good pool of talent and the fact that English was the native language. There has been speculation that some banks may move abroad if the government clamps down on bonus payments.","Barclays boss Bob Diamond has said that taxpayers should not bail out banks, and that those banks that get into trouble should be allowed to fail."
"Paddy Power and Betfred faced criticism their roulette-style games undermined new rules on fixed-odds betting. The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals was this week cut from £100 to £2, and the regulator warned against any attempts to circumvent the rules. Betfred said it wanted more talks with the commission, while Paddy Power said its game was only a limited trial. The £2 cap on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) was recommended by the Gambling Commission in March last year and is backed by the government as part of efforts to reduce gambling-related harm. The Betfred game involved two cyclists on a screen in shops racing on a velodrome track with numbers on it. When the cyclist at the rear catches the one in front, the number they are on is the winning number. The numbers are 1 to 36, mirroring those on a roulette wheel, and other bets can be placed on odd or even numbers, colours, rows and columns. Customers could bet up to £500. Paddy Power's game, with a maximum stake of £100 - the level before this week's FOBT rule-change - also involved betting on numbers between 1 and 36. A Paddy Power spokesman said: ""This game was introduced as part of a short trial in a selection of shops. The trial was ceased within 24 hours of commencement and this product will not be launched across our estate."" Act responsibly Ahead of the commission's intervention, both firms drew fire from critics. Shadow culture minister Tom Watson described them as ""FOBTs through the back door"". Tracey Crouch MP, who resigned as sports minister over the delay in cutting FOBT stakes, said any attempt circumvent this week's changes to the maximum stakes ""would be morally irresponsible"". In a statement on Tuesday, Richard Watson, executive director for enforcement at the commission, said: ""We have been absolutely clear with operators about our expectations to act responsibly following the stake cut implementation this week. ""We have told operators to take down new products which undermine the changes, and we will investigate any other products that are not within the spirit and intention of the new rules.'' He said that a third bookmaker that was poised to launch a similar product to those at Paddy Power and Betfred had been warned against doing so. A Betfred spokesman said: ""We removed the virtual cycling game and all associated marketing at 10.30am this morning after discussions with the Gambling Commission.""",Two leading UK bookmakers have pulled new high stakes betting games after a warning from the Gambling Commission.
"Speaking to business leaders in Tokyo on Monday he said Japan ""has been winning"" on trade in recent decades. He also called on Japan to build more cars in America. Mr Trump's comments come at the start of a 12-day Asian tour which is expected to be dominated by North Korea and trade. The US leader said his country had ""suffered massive trade deficits at the hands of Japan for many, many years"". ""We want free and reciprocal trade but right now our trade with Japan is not free and it's not reciprocal and I know it will be and we've started the process,"" Mr Trump told the group of US and Japanese executives. He praised Japan, which counts the US as its second largest trade partner after China, for buying American military hardware. Mr Trump also said he wanted his country to be the most attractive place to hire and invest. Trade ties Japan had a $69bn (£52.8bn) trade surplus with the US in 2016, according to the US Treasury department. The US has a much bigger imbalance with China, which Mr Trump has long rallied against. The total trade relationship between the pair was worth $648bn last year, but trade was heavily skewed in China's favour with the US amassing a nearly $310bn deficit. Mr Trump's ""America First"" views are underpinning re-examination of trade with Asia, prompting a crackdown on China's intellectual property practices and fresh negotiations after the US walked away from a major regional trade pact, the Trans Pacific Trade partnership. (TPP). The remaining 11 nations taking part in the TPP, which includes Japan, are proceeding with negotiations on the agreement without the US. The US and Japan are now working on a new roadmap for trade, but talks could put a strain on otherwise warm relations between the two countries. Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, was the first foreign leader to meet Mr Trump following his election in November 2016. The pair played golf in Japan on Sunday after which the US president described his relationship with his Japanese counterpart as ""really extraordinary"". Made in America Despite that, Mr Trump took aim at Japanese carmakers in Tokyo on Monday. ""Try building your cars in the United States instead of shipping them over. That's not too much to ask,"" the US president said at the briefing, adding, ""is that rude to ask""? Data from the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, a non-profit trade group, shows that in 2016, three-quarters of Japanese branded cars sold in the US were manufactured in North America. Last year, those carmakers built nearly 4 million vehicles and 4.7 million engines in the US it said. They contributed $45.6bn in total investment through 24 manufacturing plants, and 43 research and development and design centres in the US. Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Why is President Trump complaining about Japanese cars? It's true, as he points out, that there is a massive trade deficit between the US and Japan. Last count it was about second only to China's deficit with the US - although that's much bigger. It's also true that while a lot of Japanese cars ARE made in the US, Americans are still buying cars from Japan, along with agricultural goods, electronic components and pharmaceutical products. This doesn't wholly explain the trade gap though. The weakness of the Japanese currency, the yen, does. The weaker the yen against the US dollar, the cheaper Japanese goods are for American shoppers. But this is an old argument, which Tokyo has heard before. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be wary of any push from President Trump that will see the yen's value strengthen.",US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Japan over trade and said he would push for a fairer economic relationship between the two countries.
"Simon JackBusiness editor@BBCSimonJackon Twitter But the lender is facing a wave of compensation claims and the cost of processing each of them - whether the borrower's claim is up held or not - is £550. A year ago, 90% of all claims were ""organic"". That means the borrower initiated the claim him or herself. Only 10% came through claims management companies (CMCs). Those percentages have reversed with 90% now coming through CMCs leading to a big rise in absolute claim numbers. CMCs have taken to ""weaponising volume"" - as one industry insider told me: ""The lenders have to respond to each claim within 8 weeks. The CMCs know this and so wait till they have accumulated hundreds or even thousands of claims and drop them on the lender in one go and start the clock. ""Up against this pressure, the lenders are more likely to pay out as they don't have the time to sift through the merits of each case."" Even if they had the time - as already pointed out - they lose money whether they win or lose. Wonga raised £10 million from its investors at the beginning of August. Three weeks later they confirmed it was running out. With the CMCs having the bit between their teeth and the losing economic arithmetic of handling each claim, raising additional money to keep the company afloat looks like a challenge - especially now they have stopped lending There is no new income coming through the front door as millions leave through the back.",The average payday loan is £250. The interest Wonga receives on that is an average of £150.
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter According to an index that tracks seasonal food, the price of Christmas dinner is now at its lowest since it started in 2009. A separate calculation suggests that Christmas trees, too, are getting cheaper, costing just an eighth of what they did back in 1975. One reason for falling prices may be the arrival of low-cost supermarkets. However, the increasing cost of importing food may mean that Christmas 2016 will mark the low point for prices. The Christmas dinner index - compiled by Good Housekeeping magazine - suggests that the 11 ingredients necessary are now 10.8% cheaper than they were in 2009. Buying everything from the turkey to Christmas pudding is likely to cost £2.48 a head this year, if you bought each in the cheapest supermarket. In 2009, the equivalent cost was £2.78, according to the index. Is Christmas getting cheaper? 'Think carefully' Separate research that goes back as far as 1968 comes to a similar conclusion. The figures suggest that Christmas dinner last year was the cheapest on record, at £37.37 for a family of four. Back in 1975 the same dinner cost nearly £55, after adjusting for inflation, according to the home interiors firm Hillarys, which compiled the research. Last year a Christmas tree cost an average of £24.99, compared with the equivalent of £208 in 1975, it says. The reduction in the average cost of this year's Christmas dinner is largely down to the German supermarkets Aldi and Lidl. Buying all 11 ingredients to feed eight people will cost as little as £22 at Aldi, the Christmas dinner index shows. The same ingredients would cost nearly £50 at Marks and Spencer. ""While five of the supermarkets have cheaper baskets this year, it's mainly thanks to the big decrease in the cost of these groceries at Aldi and Lidl that the overall basket is significantly cheaper,"" said Caroline Bloor, the consumer director of Good Housekeeping. ""So think carefully where you shop or you could end up paying twice as much."" But with widespread warnings about the increased cost of importing food, many shoppers may not find prices so cheap next year. The warnings follow the decline in the value of sterling, as a result of the European referendum in June.","While many like to moan that the cost of Christmas seems to go up every year, the truth may be exactly the opposite."
"By Maddy SavageBusiness reporter, Stockholm ""It was really strange because it's not been used every day, or not even that much,"" says the 36-year-old from Stockholm. Like many Swedish parents, Mr Rääf deals with the constant stream of laundry generated by his two small children by using the larger communal washers available in his apartment block, alongside the machine in his own flat. ""So, it was a problem that needed to be fixed, but it wasn't like my life depended on it,"" he laughs. He paid a local repair firm 1,500 Swedish krona (£130; $180) to provide and fit a replacement part the following day; making use of a Swedish tax break which halves the cost of hiring people to repair white goods in your home. But fixing things that break down often isn't that easy, cost-effective or even desirable. Most of us tend to replace things that break instead of mending them. More Technology of Business According to iFixit, which campaigns for the right-to-repair, at least 30% of electric and electronic products are discarded when they are still in a repairable state. This kind of rubbish is becoming one of the world's fastest growing waste streams. Many customers don't repair household items simply because they have become more affordable to produce and buy new, in recent decades, says Thomas Opsomer, a spokesperson for iFixit. He estimates that the price of a new washing machine adjusted for inflation is between 10 and 20 times cheaper now than it would have been in the 1960s. ""If a new appliance is very cheap, then already that makes the case for repair harder,"" he says. At Lund University in southern Sweden, sustainable business researcher Jessika Luth Richter says there's also been a big cultural shift in how we value things we own. We live in an ""age of fast consumption"" where gadgets have become viewed as ""disposable"" and ""it's fashionable to upgrade our products to the latest models available"", she says. Meanwhile, brands are in tough competition with one another, and seek to lure us in with special offers and speedy delivery options to encourage us to buy new products and enjoy the ""instant gratification or instant hit"". Washing machine makers might not agree with that. Britain's Ebac already designs its washing machines to last 10 years. Founder and chief executive John Elliott thinks most washing machines are ""quite well built"", but does have his doubts about the cheapest ones on the market. ""There's some cheap washing machines - they sell them at a price lower than we can buy the components. That tells you something, doesn't it?"" While Mr Rääf was able to find a company in his Stockholm neighbourhood to fix his washing machine, Ms Luth Richter says the number of local repair stores has fallen across Europe, as our appetite for this kind of fast consumption has grown. That means even customers who want to live more sustainably can find it hard to source the expertise to fix broken products at an affordable price. iFixit's research suggests people aren't willing to pay repair costs that amount to more than 30% of the price of a new product. ""What most of them are feeling is that they don't know what it will cost and they don't know when they can get it [repaired]. And that makes all the difference,"" agrees Måns Ljungmark, a manager at Swedish appliance brand Electrolux, which has its headquarters in Stockholm. The company's actively trying to encourage more customers to fix broken products as it tries to become a more sustainable business. It has increased its online and phone advice, to help enable customers to carry out simple repairs themselves. Plus, it is trialling a £150 (1,785kr) flat fee repairs service in parts of Sweden and in Denmark. ""We are taking a risk because some repairs are more expensive and some repairs are less expensive, because we want to enable repairs,"" says Mr Ljungmark. The initiative could drive down profits from new sales, he accepts, but he hopes the business will still benefit in the long run, from ""building loyalty and trust"". So far the flat-fee service is proving popular, with a 20% increase in bookings during 2020. In Sweden, it's been enabled by the same tax break Johan Rääf used to fix his washing machine. White goods repairs have increased steadily since they were included in the scheme (known as ROT) in 2017, and jumped by 16% in 2020. There's a lack of data on customer motivations, but the Swedish Tax Agency and manufacturers like Electrolux speculate that job losses and economic uncertainty brought on by the pandemic may be encouraging more people to repair rather than splash out on newer products. Sustainability campaigners want more countries to offer similar tax incentives or other ""economic levers"" to help promote repairs. But with public finances already squeezed during the pandemic, that could be a challenge even for governments with a strong environmental agenda. Another method is punishing manufacturers that make it deliberately tricky to repair products. In the EU a new law has just come in, forcing firms to supply spare parts for machines for up to 10 years and to design products to make them longer-lasting. The rules apply to washing machines, dishwashers, fridges and lighting. Repairs should be possible with commonly-available tools and without damaging the product. Campaigners say it is a step in the right direction. But the law doesn't specify anything about the price of parts. Plus only professionals, not consumers, will be able carry out the repairs, a move backed by manufacturers who were worried about risk and liability. At iFixit, Mr Opsomer is also worried that as products in our homes become more high-tech and connected, this could ""introduce new possibilities for failure and make things harder to fix"". But manufacturers like Electrolux argue the opposite. Måns Ljungmark says that as our household products become smarter, this will actually help enable repairs and longevity. For example, if your dishwasher can suggest when you need to rinse a filter, this may prevent a future breakdown. However this still leaves consumers with a dilemma: buy a shiny new smart product designed to enable sustainability, or repair something older with fewer functions. Sustainability specialists insist it is almost always both cheaper and more sustainable to stick with what you've got. If you throw away a product, you're both contributing to the two billion tonnes of rubbish the world generates each year, and adding to the planet's carbon footprint by buying a new item, often made from newly-mined materials. But experts are split on whether profit-driven companies or fast-consuming customers will really be able to adjust their habits. ""As long as it is more profitable for a company to sell a new product than to repair that product, a company will be under very much pressure from their shareholders to do just that,"" argues Mr Opsomer. Jessika Luth Richter is more optimistic that it will become both easier and trendier to fix stuff in future. ""The more people that are repairing and are choosing to buy repair services or more repairable products, the more we will see this becoming mainstream,"" she says. ""And it used to be mainstream. So that's what makes me positive too, that. It is in some ways a return to what we used to be able as a society to do more of.""

"The Markit/CIPS PMI services index rose to 62.5 in October from 60.3 in September, beating forecasts of 59.8. Readings higher than 50 indicate growth. Markit said the services sector, which accounts for around three quarters of the economy, was the ""major driving force"" behind the UK's economic upturn. Employers were hiring people at the fastest rate since 1997, the survey found. The reading could lead to the Bank of England revising up its quarterly growth forecasts next week, Markit said. Alongside strong activity in manufacturing and construction, the results indicated quarterly economic growth of 1.3%, up from 0.8% between July and September this year. But total economic output for the UK is still less than its 2008 peak.","Activity in the UK services sector last month increased at its fastest rate since May 1997, a closely watched survey suggests."
"By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News Jeremy Lascelles says there was ""total and utter panic"" across the entire record industry when illegal music file sharing took off. ""People were saying it was the end of record labels, and that we had better close everything down, and sue absolutely everyone who was illegally downloading music. Everyone was taking the view that we were finished."" Speaking at his office in central London, he says the explosion of illegal downloading in 2000 terrified record labels. ""It was such an obvious threat to our business model. And for probably the next 15 years the record industry did indeed go into a tailspin."" At the time Jeremy was on the council of the BPI, the UK record industry's trade body. He was also the chief executive of music publisher Chrysalis Music. While most of his colleagues at the BPI wanted to sue illegal downloaders, he argued against it. ""The general view was to sue everyone, you know, even some granny in Swansea because her grandson had used her computer. ""I thought this was just insane, that the PR would be catastrophic and the genie was out of the bottle anyway,"" he says. ""I didn't know what the solution was myself, but I knew that threatening people was not the way to solve things."" Born in London in 1955, Jeremy says he became obsessed with music from about the age of seven. ""I had two older brothers, and we'd pool our pocket money to buy the latest singles or albums. You could get three singles for a quid."" In his late teens he dropped out of school to manage a band formed by one of his brothers. ""The name of the group was the Global Village Trucking Company,"" he says. ""I was tasked with booking them gigs. So I took a big bag of two pence pieces, went to the local phone box, and just started calling up pubs that had live music."" Jeremy then spent most of the 1970s as a tour manager for bands including Curved Air, whose drummer - Steward Copeland - went on to form The Police. In 1979 he was offered a job in the A&R department at Sir Richard Branson's Virgin, where he stayed for the next 13 years, rising to head that division. A&R stands for ""artists and repertoire"", and involves both finding new talent, and looking after the development of a label's existing artists. Looking back, he says the 1980s was ""a great period for British pop music, a different world to today"". During the decade record sales soared, further fuelled by the introduction of the compact disc, which meant that many music lovers bought CD versions of albums they already owned on vinyl or cassette. During his time at Virgin, he worked with acts such as Phil Collins, Culture Club, the Human League, and Simple Minds. ""I worked very closely with Phil Collins in particular, and I have nothing but good things to say about him, he is a lovely man,"" says Jeremy. ""Even at the height of his success he was quite insecure. He thought it could all disappear overnight. ""He used to send me demos of his songs to check out, and he'd say that I was the only person who would tell him anything other than the sun shines out of his proverbial. ""And Culture Club were in the office all the time. They'd just turn up unannounced, but you always knew when they were on their way, because a group of their really dedicated fans would arrive about 15 minutes beforehand, and stand outside."" In 1992 Jeremy left Virgin shortly after Sir Richard had sold up to EMI, then the UK's largest record label. He admits that he and Sir Richard had a big falling out over the sale. ""Richard had lost interest in the record label, he was obsessed with his airline by that point. We had a big, ugly row, but that's history."" After working as a consultant for a few years, in 1994 Jeremy took up the top job at Chrysalis Music. Did he think that the record industry had got complacent by the time illegal music downloads burst onto the scene in 2000? ""I don't think that we thought the good times would go on forever, but certainly we realised that they were good times."" More The Boss features: After a number of years of real pain in the industry, he says it was effectively saved by Spotify and the other streaming services. ""The record industry was incapable of thinking its way out of the trouble, and then music streaming just fell like a gift from the gods. ""Streaming has its critics, but it's just a different business model to selling physical records,"" says Jeremy. ""It's a volume or nickel-and-dime business - tiny margins, but from huge streaming numbers. ""You do hear arguments from artists that they are not earning a lot of money from streaming, but that is probably because they are stuck on old contracts with their record labels. But if you are an artist who does direct deals with the streaming platforms then you can make good money."" But streaming has greatly reduced the importance of the record labels, he agrees, with power mainly transferring to the artist management companies. ""An artist's manager is now at the centre of everything,"" says Jeremy. While the global record industry has seen ""a strong recovery"" over the past five years, ""we haven't yet, on a macro level, re-entered the glory years,"" says Tim Ingham, of trade website Music Business Worldwide. ""Don't forget that the annual revenue of the global record industry was essentially cut in half between 1999, circa $29bn [£22bn] and 2013, just under $15bn,"" he says. Yet with worldwide industry revenues topping $19bn last year ""there's plenty of money to be made, and plenty of growth ahead,"" he says. Since 2014, Jeremy has been chief executive of London-based Blue Raincoat Music, which combines both artist management and music publishing, alongside running the Chrysalis record label. ""It is a source of total, utter astonishment that I'm still working in the music industry after 47 or so years,"" he says. ""I'm still getting paid to do what is essentially my hobby. I'm a very lucky guy.""","The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.

"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One mother-of-two said she heard a ""loud crackle and bang"" from a laptop battery bought via an online marketplace before fire broke out. Experts at Electrical Safety First also found hoverboard chargers that were an electrocution risk. The charity wants platforms to have more responsibility for what is sold. Tens of thousands of these products could have been sold via online marketplaces, it said. Illegal items The charity's snapshot investigation found 70 listings of visually non-compliant electrical products for sale, thousands of which were likely to have been sold. Products were analysed from the images used to advertise them and considered to be so obviously substandard that they were illegal for sale to UK consumers, the charity said. Some of the listings had illegal plug fittings. Some were fitted with EU plugs, and sold with a UK adapter to use permanently, which increases the risk of an electric shock or fire. It found products of concern sold on Amazon Marketplace, Wish and eBay. The companies said the products had been taken off their sites immediately. In some cases action was taken against sellers, and the sites said they had monitoring in place to prevent the sale of dangerous items. 'I was terrified' One mother-of-two from North Wales said she had bought a replacement battery for her laptop from a third-party seller on an online marketplace, but said it led to a fire. ""My laptop was on a hard table, charging for a few hours. I heard a very loud crackle and bang from the laptop. Panicking, I fled into the garden, taking my dogs with me and looked in horror to see the laptop go bang again and catch fire, spreading along the table,"" she said. ""I was terrified. Luckily, my two kids were staying at their grandmother's that night but if they'd been in the house at the time the fire would have been between them and myself which is absolutely horrible to think about. ""The experience has taught me not to buy electrical products from online marketplaces again. I'll be sticking to reputable retailers."" The charity said more needed to be done to protect consumers, claiming current rules were ""ambiguous"". It has drafted a proposed change in the law, including: Lesley Rudd, chief executive of Electrical Safety First, said: ""Quite rightly, our High Street retailers are bound by legal responsibilities and it is wrong that online marketplaces can operate outside of this framework. ""It is time to even the playing field to finally tackle the scourge of substandard goods we continue to find on sites. We urge the government to adopt our Bill in order to protect millions of UK consumers and to hold online marketplaces to account.""","Dangerous kettles, hairdryers and extension leads are being sold online, an investigation has found, prompting calls for a change in the law."
"Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the downgrade was a ""humiliating blow"", and urged him to act fast to ""kick-start our flatlining economy"". But Chancellor George Osborne said the government would continue taking ""tough measures"" to deal with the deficit. Ratings agency Moody's cut the UK's top rate to Aa1. The agency, which is the first to downgrade the country's rating since 1978, said expectations were that growth would ""remain sluggish over the next few years"". It said the government's debt reduction programme faced significant ""challenges"". Mr Osborne said the decision was ""a stark reminder of the debt problems facing our country"" and did not mean the government should change course. 'Flatlining economy' However, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said: ""This credit rating downgrade is a humiliating blow to a prime minister and chancellor who said keeping our AAA rating was the test of their economic and political credibility. ""I have always said... that you should not set your policy by the credit ratings agencies. They have got things wrong in the past. ""But what matters is the underlying economic reality. There has been no growth now for two years, our deficit is getting bigger... the plan has not worked."" Mr Balls added: ""In the budget, the government must urgently take action to kick-start our flatlining economy and realise that we need growth to get the deficit down."" 'Utter failure' But Mr Osborne said Britain's situation would get much worse if the government abandoned its ""commitment to deal with that debt problem"". He said: ""What is the message from the ratings agency? Britain's got a debt problem. I agree with that. I've been telling the country for years that we've got a debt problem, we've got to deal with it. ""We've got to take tough measures to do that and I think people understand that."" Mr Osborne added the UK was still able to borrow money ""very cheaply with very low interest rates"" from investors all around the world. This was ""precisely because people have confidence that we have got a plan"", he said. ""We've got to stick to that plan and we are going to deliver that plan."" Earlier, Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, told BBC News that losing the AAA rating was not a devastating blow. ""I would say this is disappointing news and that the credit rating agencies are one benchmark amongst many in terms of the economy, but actually our credibility as a country is tested every day in the financial markets."" He said the government's fundamental aim was to create jobs, which he said it was doing. Mr Alexander insisted the government was trying to ""deal with huge financial problems we inherited from Ed Balls and his colleagues and get the country back on track"". BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said the cut carried symbolism because, even in opposition, Mr Osborne had talked about the importance of reserving the UK's AAA rating, and protecting it was one justification for his deficit reduction plan. The downgrade would therefore provide ammunition to the government's opponents, our correspondent said. Scottish finance secretary John Swinney said the cut proved the UK's ""vigorous austerity programme"" was not working and confirmed ""the utter failure of the UK government's economic strategy"". In announcing the ratings cut, Moody's cited the ""challenges that subdued medium-term growth prospects pose to the government's fiscal consolidation programme, which will now extend well into the next parliament"". It said the UK's debts were unlikely to reverse until 2016, but that its outlook was ""stable"" - without the prospect of further downgrades - and its creditworthiness remained ""extremely high"". The UK's net sovereign debt was the equivalent of 68% of the country's annual economic output, or GDP, at the end of 2012. The country has experienced a double-dip recession since 2008. It grew in the third quarter of last year, boosted by the impact of the Olympics, but shrunk again by 0.3% in the last three months of 2012. All three major credit agencies last year put the UK on ""negative outlook"", meaning they could downgrade its rating if performance deteriorates. Germany and Canada are the only major economies to currently have a top AAA rating, as much of the world has been shaken by the financial crisis of 2008 and its subsequent debt crises.","Labour has attacked the government's economic policy after the UK lost its AAA credit rating, but the coalition says it is ""making progress""."
"Lloyds Bank said the government will see a return of £21.2bn on its investment. At the height of the financial crisis taxpayers owned 43% of Lloyds. Its return to the private sector is in stark contrast with the other bailed-out bank - Royal Bank of Scotland - that is still 73% owned by taxpayers. The government has been slowly selling down its stake in Lloyds for the past five years. Ministers have claimed that all the public money used to buy Lloyds shares has been returned. 'Very difficult situation' However, the true cost is disputed, with some critics claiming the lost interest has not been taken into account. Others have argued that the heavy losses previously suffered by Lloyds also hit the government's stake. Either way, the £20.3bn of public funds used to buy the shares had already been recouped due to dividend payments made to all shareholders. At last week's annual meeting, Lloyds chief executive António Horta Osorio told shareholders he expected the government to make at least £500m from the bailout. But on Wednesday morning he said the true figure was closer to £900m and called Lloyds one of the ""strongest banks"" in the world. He also said the government had received more money than was originally invested. ""The fact that the government decided to use taxpayers' money, which is a last resort, to put £20.3bn in Lloyds at the time is evidence that the bank was in a very difficult situation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""When I arrived six years ago the bank was in a very difficult financial situation and not focused on its customers in the UK."" Job losses The shares have been sold off by Morgan Stanley at below the 73.5p average price paid in the three-stage bailout. But taking the dividend payments into account means the total £20bn outlay has already been repaid. Former chancellor George Osborne had hoped to offer the shares at a discount direct to the public, with a campaign similar to the classic Tell Sid campaign for British Gas in the 1980s. Reaction from the City was broadly positive. ""Lloyds is now back to business as usual, and the withdrawal of a large seller from the market should be positive for the share price,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The Treasury won't be making a song and dance about the Lloyds sale, seeing as we are in a period of purdah running up to the general election. ""Indeed the champagne corks should probably be kept on ice seeing as the taxpayer has only broken even on the face value of the Lloyds bailout, and is still nursing a loss if you factor in the borrowing costs associated with stumping up the money back in 2009."" The turnaround has not been without pain. About 57,000 jobs have been cut at Lloyds as it returned to profitability. The EU also forced the bank to sell 600 branches due to competition rules and £17bn was set aside to fund PPI misselling - the biggest bill for any of the banks caught up in the scandal. ""We were the first bank of the big banks to drop legal actions that were dragging paying PPI and I was the first bank to drop that legal action and start addressing s the issue seriously. It was a bad product this had to be done [fixed] on principle and not in terms on financial provisions,"" Mr Horta Osório added. But this year a £4.3bn profit - the biggest in a decade - finally allowed the bank to put its past behind it. While the sale of the Lloyds stake marks a major turning point for the bank, taxpayers' other bailed-out institution - RBS - remains firmly in government hands. RBS was rescued with a £45bn bailout in 2008 and 2009 and has failed to turn a profit since. The bank recently posted a ninth consecutive year in the red, with losses of £7bn, bringing total losses since the bailout to £58bn. The lender still faces £5.9bn of charges related to historic misconduct issues and potential legal costs. A £400m pot has also been set aside to compensate small business owners and customers of its controversial Global Restructuring Group. The now-defunct division secretly tried to profit from struggling businesses, leaked documents showed last year.","The government has confirmed its remaining shares in Lloyds Banking Group have been sold, eight years after pumping in £20bn to save it."
"The world's largest economy grew at an annual rate of 2.9% in the three months to September, the Commerce Department said. Analysts had predicted growth of just 2.5%. The stronger-than-forecast rate could increase expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates before the end of the year. The annualised rate of 2.9% is equivalent to a quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.7%, which is the way that many other countries express their growth rates. In the second quarter of the year, the US economy expanded by an annualised rate of 1.4%, or a quarterly rate of 0.4%. 'Natural bounce-back' Consumer spending, which makes up more than two-thirds of US economic activity, grew less rapidly than in the previous quarter. In the April-to-June period, it increased at an annual rate of 4.3%, but in the July-to-September period, the rate slowed to 2.1%. However, this decline was offset by businesses spending money to restock their inventories after running them down in the second quarter. ""There's nothing here that will put the Fed off hiking in December,"" said Aberdeen Asset Management fixed income investment manager Luke Bartholomew. ""This shows that the US is roughly on track. It's a natural bounce-back following a pretty underwhelming year so far. ""The election campaign has probably created a degree of uncertainty that has impacted growth,"" he added. ""But underneath all of that, the labour market is still doing well and inflation is creeping up.""","The US economy grew at the fastest pace in two years in the third quarter, initial figures have indicated."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The 26-year-old said that meant he had to ""let my pride go"" and ask his parents for financial help. ""It feels embarrassing at this age having to rely on them again,"" said Adam, from Peterborough. ""Without them, and the understanding of my landlord, I'd have lost the roof over my head. I'd literally have empty cupboards."" He was let go from his job in telesales in March and claimed Universal Credit. 'Dire straits' ""I am desperate to find work as soon as possible. I've filled in an endless number of applications, but it is the same story. Businesses are struggling to retain staff rather than taking on new people,"" he said. ""I am already falling into debt, so I want to make sure I have a job that gives a steady wage. If I don't find something by March, it will be dire straits."" That deadline is the result of his concern about the end of a £20-a-week uplift in Universal Credit. It was brought in by the government in April, after the UK went into lockdown, to help those who had lost their jobs. It was to last a year and there has been no evidence of Chancellor Rishi Sunak intending to extend the benefit boost, although the government said it would continue to assess how best to support the economy. ""A cut of £20 a week is £80 a month. Even when I was working, that was a lot of money,"" Adam said. In September, 50 children's charities, food bank providers, housing organisations, benefit and debt advisers, disability groups and others said that if the ""lifeline"" was cut, it risked plunging struggling households into poverty. Now Citizens Advice has renewed calls for the increase to be made permanent for nearly six million people receiving the benefit. ""Some were on a financial knife edge going into this crisis, while others have been forced to turn to the benefits system for the first time. Many would now struggle if they lost £20 a week,"" said Alistair Cromwell, acting chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""The government did the right thing in boosting Universal Credit at the start of this pandemic. With a tough outlook in the labour market, it must now support our recovery by making this uplift permanent."" 'Struggle' Ali, a nanny, is another jobseeker who said she was worried about having to ask her 84-year-old mother for financial help. The 56-year-old finished one job in February, then was unable to find another. ""I put into the [tax] system for 32 years. I was sensible,"" she said. ""It's been a struggle to find work because families don't want new people coming in and out of their houses. I'm hoping that will change soon, but if it doesn't, I'm worried I'll lose the house. That would be absolutely devastating."" Government commitment A survey of 6,000 people by Citizens Advice suggested that, on average, adults reported losing 13% of their household income as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. That rose to 40% for people who had applied for Universal Credit as a result of the pandemic. A government spokesman said: ""We are committed to supporting the lowest-paid families through the pandemic and beyond. ""That is why we have raised the living wage, boosted welfare support by billions of pounds and introduced a £170m scheme to help children and families stay warm and well-fed during the coldest months.""","After paying rent and essential bills, Adam Donkin has nothing left to pay the bus fare and buy his food."
"In a move that surprised analysts, Mr Lewis - who took the helm in 2014 - said the decision was ""personal"". Ken Murphy, who has held senior positions at the owner of chemist chain Boots, will replace him. The departure was announced as Tesco reported a 6.7% rise in first-half profits to £494m. Tesco chairman John Allan said he had accepted Mr Lewis' resignation with ""regret"" and said the chief executive intended to leave ""in the summer of 2020"". Mr Lewis said: ""I believe the tenure of a chief executive should be a finite one and that now is the right time to pass the baton. The turnaround is complete, we have delivered all the metrics we set ourselves."" The 54-year-old added: ""I am going to take some proper time out, recharge the batteries and think about what comes next."" Analysts at Shore Capital said he was ""the bloke that saved Tesco"". He took the helm at a tumultuous time for the supermarket group, announcing shortly after he took over in 2014 that the retailer had been overstating its profits. The company subsequently revealed a loss of £6.4bn, the biggest-ever suffered by a UK retailer Since then Mr Lewis has set about reducing costs, with the latest of round job cuts announced in August when it said 4,500 staff in 153 Tesco Metro stores would lose their roles. He also took on the discounters Aldi and Lidl by opening Jacks, Tesco's own discount chain. 'Total surprise' Mr Lewis also orchestrated Tesco's 2017 takeover of Booker, the biggest food wholesaler, in a £3.7bn deal to create the ""UK's leading food business"". Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there had been speculation about Mr Lewis' future after that deal as Booker's chief executive Charles Wilson had joined at the time. ""We're all trying to grapple exactly about the timing right now,"" said Mr Monteyne. His departure now was ""a total surprise"", he said. Mr Lewis had joined five years ago ""at a very difficult moment"" for Tesco, Mr Monteyne said. ""Not only had it lost the trust of the customers, losing material market to the discounters, it ended up with an accounting fraud... internal morale broken. He really took over a broken company, and from being the most profitable retailer in Europe, suddenly had losses for the first time ever."" As with comedy, timing is everything in big business. Many chief executives overstay their welcome, failing to realise that the clock is always ticking; the average tenure of a FTSE 350 chief executive is 4.5 years, and coming down. Dave Lewis, however, is clever enough to know that it's best to leave while the going is good. He joined Tesco when it was in disarray and at a time of some drama. There had been a string of profits warnings, a boardroom bust-up leading to the departure of the chief executive and a nasty accounting scandal. Mr Lewis moved quickly and the returns show in today's half-year results, which were rather overshadowed by Mr Lewis's departure. Sales were flat, but the operating margin hit 4%, a year before Mr Lewis said it would. That is an achievement but Mr Lewis will know that running Tesco will not get any easier. Keeping Tesco at that level of operating margin is going to be a long, hard slog. There will inevitably be speculation that he will return to Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant where he worked before joining Tesco. The shares initially dipped but were trading nearly 2% higher at 243p as the results for the six months to 24 August were better than expected. Operating profit, excluding one-off items, rose by 25% at £1.4bn. Like-for-like sales, which strip out revenue from new stores opened during the six months, rose 0.1% in the UK and Ireland. At a group level, including operations in central Europe, notably Poland, and Asia, same store sales fell 0.4%. When Mr Lewis joined Tesco from household goods company Unilever he was the first outsider to run the supermarket chain. Speculation will turn to what he will do next, but Mr Lewis said: ""I'm going to step back and have a think about what I want to do next with my family. I'm 54 years old and I'm going to sit back and think where I can make the best contribution."" His successor, Mr Murphy, has also been hired from outside after a lengthy career with Boots, which is now part of Walgreens Boots Alliance. The 52 year-old graduated from University College Cork and was educated at the Christian Brothers College. The Irishman left Walgreens Boots Alliance in January 2019 when his last role was chief commercial officer, president of global brands. He remains as a consultant. But he held a wide-range of roles, including a two year period as chief operating officer of Boots until October 2013. At Tesco, his salary will be £1.35m salary before bonuses, and his joining date has not yet been confirmed. In-tray ""We would imagine that Mr Lewis may have been familiar with his replacement from his Unilever personal care days,"" said analysts at Shore Capital. ""Mr Murphy has big shoes to fill."" They expect continuity for now but when Mr Murphy does take the helm he will face a number of challenges: Mr Allen described Mr Murphy as ""growth-orientated seasoned business leader"" and said he had been been looking for ""experience, proven leadership in international retail businesses, a strong strategic mind"" In preparation for Brexit, Tesco said it was increasing its stock of long-life shelf products and noted that the UK imports about 50% of fresh food it needs.",Tesco's chief executive Dave Lewis is to leave next year after leading a turnaround plan for Britain's biggest supermarket chain.
"On Tuesday, a Chinese newspaper alleged that Alcon paid doctors ""research fees"" through a third-party for fake clinical trials that never took place. This is the second such allegation to be made against Novartis recently. Last month, the 21st Century Business Herald claimed the Swiss company bribed doctors to increase drug sales. The latest report was also carried by the same paper. ""Alcon does not tolerate activities that are not in compliance with the laws and regulations in the markets where we operate,"" Novartis said in a statement. ""When any inappropriate activities are identified, we take swift remedial action."" Novartis is the latest pharmaceutical company to come under scrutiny in China. Last month, the 21st Century Business Herald carried a report making bribery claims against US drugmaker Eli Lilly. It cited a former employee of the firm, identified by a pseudonym, as saying the firm paid out 30m yuan ($4.9m; £3.1m) as bribes to doctors to prescribe its drugs. Eli Lilly said it had launched an internal probe last year after a former manager made similar allegations against it. It said that while it had not been able to verify the allegations it was continuing to investigate them. In July, Chinese authorities accused British drug giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) of bribing doctors to boost sales of some of its drugs in the country. GSK is alleged to have directed up to £320m through travel agencies to facilitate bribes to doctors and officials. The company has admitted that some senior executives in its China office appear to have broken the law. It has said that it is co-operating with the authorities.","Novartis says it is investigating claims that its eye care unit, Alcon, bribed doctors in over 200 hospitals in China to promote its lens implants."
"A licensed driver on its app must take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of driving with a passenger or travelling to pick up someone. Drivers who do not take a long enough break will not be able to log in to the app and take trips. The ride-hailing firm says it believes the move ""is an industry first"". But the association that represents black cab drivers told the BBC it was ""a toothless cap"". 'No rule' Andrew Byrne, Uber's head of policy, said: ""We are not aware of any other private hire operator in the UK that has introduced such a limit. ""While drivers only spend an average of 30 hours a week logged into our app, we want to do our part to ensure they don't drive tired."" A director of the National Private Hire and Taxi Association told the BBC: ""There is no rule for our drivers. ""Over the last two decades there have been at least three attempts made by the European Commission to put UK taxi and private hire vehicles under the working time directive. ""But it's never been allowed to happen because our taxis, unlike buses and coaches, do not have a tachograph fitted so we can't keep track of drivers' hours or restrict them."" Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association for black cab drivers, told the BBC: ""This is a toothless cap that still allows Uber's drivers to work over 100 hours a week, and is a PR stunt that will not improve passenger safety. ""Uber can't claim its drivers are self-employed and aren't subject to minimum wage, but then try to limit the hours that they can work."" ""Unlike Uber drivers, all black cab drivers undertake enhanced driving tests and as such are well aware of the dangers of working long hours. This high standard of safety is reflected in the low number of accidents involving licensed black cab drivers"".","Uber is introducing a new policy on drivers' hours across the UK next week, which it says will help to increase safety for drivers and passengers."
"The fire started after a battery in the jet's auxiliary power system overheated. The airline said that no passengers or crew members were hurt as they had already disembarked. This is the latest setback for the Dreamliner, after production delays and several technical problems. ""Smoke was initially discovered by maintenance staff in the rear end of the cabin, and confirmed by another maintenance staff who also detected smoke outside the aircraft,"" Carol Anderson a spokeswoman for Japan Airlines said. Meanwhile, Doug Alder, a spokesman for Boeing was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying that the planemaker was ""aware of the situation"" and that it was ""working with the airline to understand more about it right now"". The US National Transportation Safety Board said on Twitter than it had opened an investigation into the fire. Boeing says it is assisting with that investigation and cannot comment further. 'Very late' Professor Rigas Doganis, visiting professor at the UK's College of Aeonautics at Cranfield University, said new aircraft types tended to experience teething problems. But he said a fire was unusual, and that much would depend on whether the Boeing fire was a ""one off"" or was due to some design weakness. Only the impending investigation will determine that, Prof Doganis added. However. he said the incident ""will not affect their [787] sales, as airlines do understand that problems occur with new aircraft"". The former chief executive of Olympic Airways added: ""The problem with the 787 was that it was long-delayed compared with the planned in-service date; early deliveries were very late and that did more damage to the company's reputation than this incident may do."" Prof Doganis said that Airbus had been also hit by similar delays surrounding the launch of its A380 aircraft. Growing troubles? The Dreamliner is one of the most advanced planes ever built. However, a spate of technical issues has hurt its image. Last year, a United Airlines flight was forced to make an emergency landing due to an electrical problem. In December, Qatar Airways grounded one of its 787 Dreamliners after several manufacturing faults caused electric problems similar to those that affected the United plane. Chief executive Akbar Al Baker told the BBC at the time that he was ""disappointed because we have an aircraft that has just been delivered to us and for the last five days we can't fly it"". To add to Boeing's woes, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said in December that it had identified errors in the assembly of fuel line couplings, in the Dreamliner. It warned that these errors could result in fuel leaking on to hot engine parts and start a fire, cause engine failure, or simply see the plane run out of fuel. Analysts said the latest incident on the Japan Airlines flight was a major blow to Boeing. ""I don't want to be an alarmist, but onboard fires on airplanes are as bad as it gets,"" said Carter Leake, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets in Virginia. ""Even though it happened on the ground, rest assured the FAA is asking 'What if it happened in the air?""","Japan Airlines said that a fire broke out in one of its Boeing 787 Dreamliners, shortly after it landed in Boston, following a flight from Tokyo."
"The £500m fund will not be used to build new railway lines - it is only meant to fund feasibility studies of routes that could be restored. The plan was promised in November's Conservative election manifesto. But Labour called the initiative ""meaningless"", adding that £500m would help reopen just 25 miles of railway. And the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) described the funds as a ""drop in the ocean"". The government will start by funding proposals for two lines - the Ashington-Blyth-Tyne line in Northumberland and the Fleetwood line in Lancashire. Communities will also be able to apply for some of the remainder of the £500m pot to help restore their lines. What were the Beeching cuts? Roughly 5,000 miles of track were closed and more than 2,300 stations were axed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, following the Beeching report. The aim was to cut the mounting debts of the nationalised British Rail by removing duplicated routes and closing the least-used branch lines of the railway. This became known as the Beeching cuts. The plans drew huge opposition from rural local communities, which campaigned and successfully prevented some routes and stations from closing. What is the government planning to do? On Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited the Fleetwood and Poulton-le-Fylde line which was closed in 1970. ""Many communities still live with the scars that came from the closure of their local railway more than five decades ago,"" he said. ""Investing in transport links is essential to levelling up access to opportunities across the country, ensuring our regions are better connected, local economies flourish and more than half a century of isolation is undone."" People in Fleetwood, a town of 25,000 that is hemmed in on the Lancashire coast, told us unanimously that reopening their defunct rail line to nearby Poulton-le-Fylde would be a good thing. They say their town has lost so much over the years and they hope that restoring the railway would help regenerate the area and cut congestion on the roads. The government is currently falling over itself to back policies that improve regional connectivity around the country. Just think of its bailout for the regional airline Flybe. But today's announcement is only a tentative step towards recreating a functioning railway to Fleetwood. An assessment of the economic and social case will now be carried out. The funding for Fleetwood - £100,000 - is peanuts for now. If the assessment is positive, more money will follow. However, even £500m (the total funding pledged for helping to reopen lines cut during the Beeching era) is not a big sum of money in railway infrastructure terms. Michael Byng, a railway construction consultant, believes reopening the Colne to Skipton line near Leeds would cost around £368m on its own. He also believes that reopening the rail line to Fleetwood, which does have a tram that runs along the coast to Blackpool, would not be money well spent and other options like improving the connectivity of the tram itself should be considered. What reaction has there been? Commenting on the proposals, shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""The Conservatives claim to have been reversing Beeching cuts since 2017 despite not reopening an inch of track. ""Investing in the railway is a fantastic policy but this is meaningless without a serious funding commitment of billions of pounds."" Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, was similarly sceptical about the government's plans. ""RMT welcomes any investment in our railways but £500m is a drop in the ocean compared to what's really required to connect our abandoned communities and reverse decades of cuts to infrastructure and maintenance,"" he said. Dennis Fancett, chairman of South East Northumberland Rail User Group, told the BBC: ""What I was really hoping for was an announcement that we're all systems go and funding for the entire reopening is provided and building can start. ""The business case for reopening this line is the economic regeneration of South East Northumberland."" Brian Crawford, chairman of the Poulton & Wyre Railway Society, said restoration of the disused railway line to Fleetwood from Poulton-le-Fylde could reinvigorate the coastal town. ""There are two aims - one of commuters going to work and the other one is to make Fleetwood a major tourist destination. It has a fantastic seafront but without a railway, we don't seem to get that many visitors,"" he told the BBC. Do you have a question about the government's rail plans?

"The retailer reported that orders since the end of June were £100m higher than expected, having initially predicted demand would fall. Boss Tim Stacey said people seemed to be spending less on holidays, going out and clothes and more on their homes. Although DFS warned that the surge may impact the rest of the year. ""While positive trading momentum currently remains we do note that some consumers may be bringing forward spending decisions and this may impact trading later in the financial year,"" it said. In a trading statement covering the last six weeks, the retailer said it had seen year-on-year order intake growth of £70m. Having previously forecast that sales would fall as consumers spent less, it said that was now ""significantly ahead of our initial expectations"" and in effect up by £100m. ""We believe that this trading performance reflects a combination of consumers currently spending more on their homes relative to other sectors [and] latent demand caused by the nationwide lockdown,"" the firm said. It suggested the sales had come both through its stores - all of which were temporarily closed earlier this year - and its website. However, it said it was ""exceptionally difficult"" to assess the long term outlook for the business due to uncertainty around the pandemic and the potential impact of a hard Brexit. Shares in the business closed more than 10% higher in London.",Sofa seller DFS says it has seen a surprise jump in sales as people splash out after spending more time at home in lockdown.
"The consumer group found 65% of bank staff with sales targets said they were being placed under more pressure than ever to hit them. The British Bankers' Association said staff incentives are now based on clear criteria related to customer service. The research was carried out between October and early December. Which? surveyed branch and call centre staff at HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and Santander. More than 550 bank staff were interviewed, of which 371 have a sales role. And, of those, 298 said they had sales targets to meet. The consumer group said the findings were broadly similar across all five banking giants. Which? said the findings indicated that many workers are still being driven towards putting ""sales before service"". It comes as complaints about the payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal continue to rise beyond expectations. In the first half of 2012, the Financial Ombudsman Service received 135,170 new complaints, of which 85,562 - or 63% - were about PPI. The total bill is predicted to reach about £15bn across the industry. PPI was originally sold alongside loans, mortgages and credit cards, wrongly in many cases, to cover repayments if people became ill or lost their jobs. 'Real pressure' In September, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) gave High Street banks 12 to 18 months to rein in the bonus schemes they use to encourage staff to sell insurance, loans and bank accounts. The following month, Barclays announced that it would no longer pay any commission to 18,000 staff in its High Street branches and call centres for selling financial policies. Bonuses, it said, would depend only on giving customers good quality service. Which? found that some 46% of bank staff it had surveyed knew colleagues who had mis-sold products just to meet their sales targets. Of the staff surveyed who had a sales role, more than a third - 37% - said they were uncomfortable with the level of pressure placed on them to push a product. ""Senior bankers say the culture is changing, but this shows it just isn't filtering through to staff on the front line, who remain under real pressure to put sales before service, even after incentives are taken away,"" said Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith. He added: ""This proves the need for big change across the industry and for bankers to put customers first, not sales."" Only 6% of those surveyed who were told to sell more said this was because it was in the customer's best interest. A spokesman for the British Bankers' Association said: ""Selling people products they do not need is not putting the customer's interests first and therefore is ultimately bad for the bank."" ""The banks will be looking at the findings of this small survey - along with their own internal research - to understand why any staff might feel otherwise."" Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said: ""So long as the banks are allowed to lend out their ill-gotten gains at up to 25% but are only obliged to repay it with 8% when they are found out, there will always be a good reason for them to keep on mis-selling."" Which? said it planned to hand in a dossier of evidence on the banking industry to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, the government and opposition MPs and the Financial Services Authority (FSA).","Major mis-selling scandals have failed to stop banks pressuring staff into pushing potentially unsuitable products, Which? has said."
"Italy - with some of the toughest restrictions - has seen the biggest rise, with group calls rocketing by more than 1,000% in the last month. The social media giant said total messaging traffic on all its platforms had increased 50% on average across the hardest hit countries. Facebook owns Instagram along with popular messaging app WhatsApp. But the company said the higher usage won't protect it from expected falls in digital advertising across the world. ""We don't monetize many of the services where we're seeing increased engagement,"" Facebook wrote in a post on Tuesday. Italy has a death toll now above 6,000 people from the virus. Along with the huge rise in time in group calls (three or more users), the country has seen a 70% rise in time spent on Facebook-owned apps. Facebook outlined steps it is taking to increase capacity during the heightened traffic as people are stuck indoors and working from home. ""We're monitoring usage patterns carefully, making our systems more efficient, and adding capacity as required,"" the post from Alex Schultz, vice president of analytics, and Jay Parikh, vice president of engineering wrote. But it admitted this could become harder. ""Maintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home. We are experiencing new records in usage almost every day."" Facebook has lowered video quality in Europe to help reduce demand on internet service providers. Amazon, Apple TV+ and Netflix have all announced similar measures. The changes mean each video will use less data, putting less strain on networks already struggling with increased traffic as people stream more content while self-isolating at home.",Facebook has seen usage across its platforms surge in countries that have brought in virus lockdowns.
"By David SilverbergTechnology of Business rReporter An associate professor at the University of Kansas's journalism department, she bypassed China's strict digital media censors thanks to the roaming plan of her US phone firm. This allowed her to access websites such as those from Google not available in China. ""I was telling my Chinese friends about the bomb detonating outside the [US] embassy and they didn't know what I was talking about, because this news wasn't appearing in their search feeds,"" recalls Prof Seo, who teaches courses on digital media. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power. Read more here. Her experience is common for any westerner visiting China. The internet in the world's most populous country is heavily restricted and censored, leading experts to speculate that in the future there could be two distinct internets - one led by China and one by the US. The point was made last year by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt. At a private event, when an economist asked Mr Schmidt (now a board member of Google parent company Alphabet) about the potential of the internet fragmenting into different sub-internets with different regulations, he replied, ""I think the most likely scenario now is not a splintering, but rather a bifurcation into a Chinese-led internet and a non-Chinese internet led by America."" Such a divide is already in place, due to the Great Firewall of China, a government-sponsored programme that censors content within its digital borders. Chinese users can't access Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox or Pinterest, among other popular sites. They also can't read online information on the Tiananmen Square massacre or criticism aimed at President Xi Jinping. Even online images of Winnie the Pooh have been banned in China after protesters compared President Xi's face to the classic Disney character. ""In one of the biggest markets in the world, tech companies are leaving because they can't fully operate how they want to, by freely sharing information online,"" notes Ms Seo. Such censorship means overseas businesses are hampered if they want to expand into China - one of the most attractive markets in the world. More Technology of Business No matter the size of the company, to operate in China overseas firms have to jump through hoops that can cause them problems. While Apple services and products are available in China, the California-based tech giant has sparked controversy over its activities in the Chinese market. In 2017, China asked Apple to remove the New York Times and Skype app from its App Store. Apple complied. Google has also waded into Chinese waters, only to be met with intense criticism. Most notably, Google secretly worked on a version of its search engine to go up against Chinese-born Baidu. The Chinese-only Google would censor some results relating to human rights violations and controversial laws. ""Project Dragonfly"" was uncovered in a 2018 article by The Intercept, and Google eventually scrapped the project. ""When you enter search terms in China on their search engine, you get a different result from what you see in the West,"" says Sarah Cook, senior China research analyst at Freedom House, a US independent watchdog focusing on human rights. ""The red lines of what is being censored are constantly moving."" 2019 marks the fourth year in a row that Freedom House has ranked China at the bottom for Internet freedom in its annual report ""Freedom on the Net"". A business looking to enter China has to either play by the rules or leave. For example, LinkedIn doesn't allow Chinese users to access politically sensitive profiles or posts from people outside the country. Why such restrictions on a tool specifically designed to open up digital realms of information, media and debate? ""That censorship relates to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party and promoting an official narrative about the nation-state,"" says Renren Yang, an assistant professor of modern Chinese popular culture at the University of British Columbia. While Chinese internet users can't use Google and WhatsApp, they have Chinese equivalents, Baidu and WeChat. Meanwhile, Amazon shut down its online store in China earlier this year in the face of poor sales trying to compete against Alibaba. Isn't China already crafting its own parallel internet? ""An isolated Chinese internet is cut off from the rest of the world,"" says Ms Cook. ""And what is worrying is that other countries are copying what China is doing by blocking access to certain sites or slowing down net service during protests or rallies."" Prof Yang says it would only benefit China to usher in more Western companies seeking to bring its services to the country. ""For example, competition with Chinese local telecom companies will spawn the invention of new technologies and new services that people can afford and utilize. Competition brings forth innovation."" Prof Seo isn't optimistic China will change its online tune anytime soon. ""Since China has replaced Western media with their own apps and sites, they don't really need western tech companies."" Other experts are hopeful that a splintering of the Internet won't be permanent. Prof Yang says: ""One day, I'd like to see the Great Firewall come down, just like the Berlin Wall did.""","When Hyunjin Seo visited Beijing in July last year, she scrolled through Google News on her smartphone and discovered several reports about an attack on the city's US embassy."
"By Jamie RobertsonBusiness reporter, BBC News Valued at just over £500m the company was being wooed by a clutch of private equity firms. But ""market volatility"" killed the talks. Since then Micro Focus's fortunes have changed dramatically. Last week it joined the FTSE 100 and on Thursday bought the software arm of Hewlett Packard Enterprise to become one of the UK's largest tech firms. To complete the irony, the collapse of the Micro Focus talks in 2011 coincided, almost to the day, with Hewlett-Packard's disastrous $11bn takeover of rival software group Autonomy. The remains of Autonomy, massively written down, are among the assets that Micro Focus is now buying for $8.8bn (£6.6bn) from Hewlett Packard Enterprise - a spin-off from HP's computer and printer business. It is the latest and biggest purchase on Micro Focus's shopping list, drawn up by executive chairman Kevin Loosemore. As part of the shopping spree, the Berkshire-based company has bought two other US software companies - Attachmate for $1.2bn in 2014 and Serena Software this year for $540m. Mr Loosemore, who took the helm in 2011, said: ""I contacted HPE in about February this year. We are in regular contact with most players in the mature software space, it's what we do, and HPE had just separated from HPI (Hewlett Packard Inc) at the back end of last year and I was personally intrigued as to what their new strategy was going to be."" Old tech - new tech The core of Micro Focus's business is this ""mature software space"", specifically linking old software technology to new. So for instance, it can make old cash machines talk to the latest banking software, or connect a supermarket's old inventory control system to the latest generation of mainframes. These businesses can be made to generate huge amounts of cash. Since 2011 Micro Focus has delivered annual compound shareholder returns of 39%. And its stated strategy is to deliver 15-20% returns to shareholders each year. That explains why Micro Focus has little problem funding its acquisitions. But its rise from mid-cap company to FTSE entrant and the near-doubling of its share price in the last year has taken many by surprise, so much so that many of the top technology analysts in London simply did not cover the stock. One analyst said: ""I think many have steered clear of it because it is a complex company, a kind of portfolio business and until recently was not considered big enough. But that will all change now."" However, Paraag Amin, technology analyst from Peel Hunt, has been watching the company for almost ten years. He explained that its strategy has been to buy up software that is ""mature"", i.e. no longer growing and about to be superseded by new products. Maturing software Software companies that were developed in the nineties have been ""maturing"" over the last five years and have fueled Micro Focus's dramatic acquisition programme and rapid expansion. ""Micro Focus has realised that as technologies mature and go into decline they, as a management team, can make them more profitable by supporting them and making them work in the new environment. You could call them asset managers of software products. ""For instance, Autonomy, which made up about 6% of HP's business will now make up over half of Micro Focus's business. But it is hoping it can take its profit margins from the 20-30% range up to 40% which is the average for Micro Focus's businesses."" Asked whether Micro Focus had the skill to hold together such a rapidly expanding group of companies, Mr Amin said: ""It's exactly what they are good at, taking in declining companies, turning them round and supporting them.""",Almost exactly five years ago the UK software group Micro Focus was on the verge of being taken over.
"By Carolyn RiceBusiness reporter, BBC News The softly-spoken box office assistant from Surrey lists rent and student loan payments as her top priorities for any spare cash she may have. ""Retirement just seems so far off. I am 24 and it is 40 years until it is going to be relevant to me. There are so many other things that I'm concerned about trying to pay off that it is just not on my radar,"" she says. Sheena is not alone. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) only 38% of employed women aged 22-29 are members of a work-based pension scheme. And with women living longer than ever before, the average life expectancy is now more than 20 years on from state retirement age, are today's women saving enough to ensure a comfortable retirement? Lessons Tina Watkin, a 66-year-old from Yorkshire, has spent her life juggling part time jobs whilst bringing up her children. She has clocked up hours as a lollypop lady, a barmaid and a driver. She has also earned money from selling coats and taking part in market research. But despite all these jobs she does not have an occupational pension and gets by on a weekly income from her state pension topped up with Pension Credit. ""A year before I retired I put in for a pensions forecast and it came back at £53 a week. I could not believe it. I feel totally sick that I never realised it before,"" she says. To make ends meet she has to live frugally and think carefully about all expenditure. Only by keeping a very close eye on her outgoings can she afford to pay the bills. She feels bitter about the lack of pensions advice and blames this for the situation that she is in. ""It makes you feel angry, I was a hard worker and I paid my taxes. I never saw any adverts in magazines or on the television, but when you are paying National Insurance through your work it would be nice if you were given some advice,"" she says. ""I just did not have time to think about it."" State pension But Sarah Pennells, from money website Savvywoman.co.uk, thinks it is important that women do think about pensions as soon as possible. ""Don't think of saving as depriving yourself of money today but giving yourself options for tomorrow,"" she says. ""Ask yourself if you want to live on £20 a day when you retire, which is what the state pension is likely to be worth. If the answer is 'no', then you will have to save for your retirement."" The state pension scheme has not provided all women with a full pension once they reach the age of 60. Until recent changes by the coalition government, both men and women had to have 39 qualifying years of paying National Insurance contributions in order to claim the maximum basic state pension. Some women found that they were not entitled to a full pension payment because they had not built up enough qualifying years. Like Mrs Watkin, they may have spent some of those years working part-time or not working at all, perhaps because they were bringing up children. A recent report by Scottish Widows claims that two thirds of pensioners living in poverty are women. ""Women are definitely the poor relations when it comes to pensions,"" says Ros Altmann, director-general of Saga. ""They tend to earn less, they work for fewer years, they have more years out of the workforce, and if you are not working you cannot do any saving. ""They may not have a husband to rely on as perhaps they might traditionally have done. Women need to make sure they are planning their life so they do not end up in dire straits."" Top-up Many companies offer a workplace pension scheme that is open to employees. Typically, an employee contributes a percentage of their salary, the company contributes a further percentage, and there is an element of tax relief. Any income from these schemes would be in addition to a state pension once retirement age is reached. Sheena Khanna's sister Mohini, 27, is a research assistant and decided to join her company's pension scheme after a visit from a broker. ""I am contributing the same amount as my employer and it comes out of my pay packet automatically, I chose to do it that way because I can afford it at the moment. I do not have to think too much, it just happens every month,"" she says. ""If you are just on a state pension it is quite a meagre amount, it is not enough to live on if you do not have supplementary savings or a private pension."" However, the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that between 2005 and 2009 women aged 22 to 29 experienced the biggest fall in pension scheme membership. Sheena is not sure how much money she will need to fund her retirement dreams of travelling and spending time with her family. ""It is hard to grasp how much money you will need to have saved to take you through your life,"" she says. She thinks around £20,000 or £30,000 a year might be enough. That is more money than Tina Watkin can dream of having in her retirement. Her pension amounts to just over £6,800 a year - and she has some advice for Sheena. ""Speak to someone who is a professional and knows about pensions. If I had known sooner how much money I would end up with I would have done something,"" she says. The amount Mrs Watkin lives on is a shock to Sheena. ""That is very scary when it is put like that, it is quite worrying,"" she says. But is it enough to get her thinking about saving for old age? ""Yes, it probably is,"" she says.",Drama graduate Sheena Khanna has not even started thinking about pensions. There are so many other things to save and pay for.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The process, were it to go all the way to a contested final court hearing, can in itself cost more than £30,000, money experts suggest. On top of that, the settlement may come with its own financial pressures. Lawyers and charities say that there are ways to keep the cost down, but that irreconcilable couples must also go into a divorce or dissolution of their civil partnership with their eyes open to the potential financial squeeze. ""For anyone embarking on this journey, there's no nice way to put this: it's likely to be a rough road ahead, which takes its toll both emotionally and financially,"" says Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown. ""Even with careful planning and a sensible approach, it won't be comfortable."" Research by insurer Aviva suggests 16% of couples who separate also buy a new home, spending an average of £144,600. Money matters take an average of 14.5 months to settle after a split, it adds. More information: A do-it-yourself divorce The most obvious way to keep down the cost of a divorce or dissolution is to come to an agreement without the use of solicitors or other professionals, particularly if it is an amicable split. In Scotland, the do-it-yourself option is set out in law and called ""simplified"" divorce or dissolution. Only certain couples can use this procedure. For example, it is not available for those with children aged under 16. In Northern Ireland, couples have to appear in person before a judge in either a county court or a High Court. However, they can appear in court as a ""personal petitioner"", without having to use a solicitor. In England and Wales, couples can do it themselves or use a low-cost online service. However, Katie O'Callaghan, of Boodle Hatfield lawyers, warned that anyone failing to get final, legal approval on their financial deal from a court - known as a consent order - can find themselves subject to a claim from their ex-partner in the years ahead. ""It is not enough for couples to agree between themselves on a handshake and think that this will protect them in the future,"" she says. Avoiding solicitors Legal costs can easily stack up, and even solicitors when first consulted will check whether separating couples have tried cheaper alternatives. The most popular of these is mediation. This is not relationship counselling. It can help people to agree on how to divide assets such as money, property, savings and investments. Legal aid is available to help those on low incomes with the cost. Following mediation, a solicitor can draw up the consent order. Couples with more complex issues, or who fail to agree, will go to a solicitor. The costs involved can range from £2,000 to £3,000 for a negotiated financial settlement up to £30,000 plus VAT if a contested case goes through court, according to the Money Advice Service. Couples in the process of a divorce or dissolution can apply to a court, at a cost of £255, for a financial order. This covers areas such as a lump sum payment, ownership of a property, regular maintenance payments to help with children or living expenses, and a share of a partner's pension payments. Ultimately, in many cases, a judge will decide how the couple's assets are divided between the couple. The decision will be based on the length of the marriage or civil partnership, the ages of the parties involved, their ability to earn, their property and money, their living expenses, and their standard of living. The roles played, such as breadwinners or primary carers will also be considered. The judge will make arrangements for any children first, especially their housing arrangements and child maintenance, if there are not enough assets to go around. There can be tax implications following these rulings. Common issues Ms O'Callaghan, of Boodle Hatfield, suggests that after a split it is important for couples to maintain the financial organisation in the household that they had prior to the separation. So, for example, if the husband pays the mortgage, he should continue to do so. That is because keeping the same financial arrangements will make the court proceedings simpler. She adds that courts have wide-ranging powers to find any hidden assets, so individuals should not squirrel those away, however acrimonious the split. Individuals can also find themselves worse off than they expected if they cohabit with a new partner. If they are living together, the finances of the new partner can be taken into account during a divorce settlement with the ex-partner. If they are not cohabiting, then such finances will be ignored. Ultimately, if a couple's finances are more complex, it is likely to cost more - in both time and money - to reach an agreement.","The emotional upheaval of divorce can be difficult to deal with, but so too can the financial implications."
"The long-awaited 26-to-30 railcard - known as the Millennial Railcard - goes on sale at midday on Wednesday. It offers a third off most leisure fares. And a new 16-to-17 railcard, to be launched in the summer, will offer 50% off all fares. The idea is to help students travelling to school or college. The categories below are valid for the whole of Britain. Fares and discounts in Northern Ireland are set locally. For 16-to-17-year-olds Currently, this age group is covered by the 16-to-25 railcard - see below - but from September, they will also be eligible for a new, more generous discount. The 16-to-17 railcard will entitle holders to a 50% discount on season tickets, peak, off-peak and advance fares. The idea is to help students travelling to college. It is not yet known how much users will have to pay for the card, but it is expected to be around £30. The government says it will announce more details in the summer. In many parts of the country, local authorities already subsidise fares for this age group, so it is not clear whether the new card will offer larger savings. The 16-to-25-year-old Young Person's card The existing card offers one-third off many fares, including off-peak and anytime tickets, for anyone in the age group or in full-time education. However, there is a minimum fare of £12 for journeys that start before 10:00 on weekdays - but not in July or August, when students are on holiday. It costs £30 a year or £70 for three years. The government says the average annual saving for such cardholders is £192 a year. The card is available either as a physical document, or in an app on a phone. The 26-to-30 Millennial cards For a £30 fee, the new railcard will offer similar benefits to the Young person's 16-to-25 railcard. Journeys starting before 10:00 will carry a minimum fare of £12. But unlike the card for younger passengers, that minimum fare will also apply on weekdays throughout July and August. There will be no fare reductions on season tickets or Eurostar services. The government calculates that the average passenger in this age group can save £125 a year by having a railcard. This is a digital-only card, so it needs to be stored on a mobile phone. The app can be downloaded from 26-30railcard.co.uk. Full details of all the railcards available can be found here. Under-16s Children under the age of five travel free. Those between the ages of six and 15 are eligible for child fares. The discount is typically 50%. BBC News has set up a UK Facebook group to talk about affordable living. Join the group here.",Two new railcards in 2019 should mean cheaper fares for millions of young people in Britain.
"It is the latest round in a price war among British supermarkets, which are reacting to the challenge of discounters such as Aldi and Lidl. From Monday the price of 135 Morrisons products, including flour and oven chips, will fall by an average of 14%. Earlier this month Morrisons' former chairman Sir Ken Morrison criticised the performance of the current boss. At Morrisons annual shareholder meeting, Sir Ken likened the plans of chief executive Dalton Philips to the manure produced by his herd of cattle. In May Morrisons reported that like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - fell by 7.1% in the 13 weeks to 4 May. In March it announced that £1bn would be spent over three years on lower prices, developing a loyalty scheme and improving its own brand goods. As part of that campaign, in May it detailed a big round of discounts, a move which has been described by the company as its ""big bazooka"". Monday's price cuts are the next stage and affect categories not included in May's discounts. Morrison's chief executive Dalton Philips described the move as ""permanent price cuts, not promotions"" and said ""they won't be the last"". Taking on rivals Analysts say the supermarket industry has become a tough place to do business. ""It's becoming increasingly difficult to generate growth with weak demand and downward pressure on pricing,"" said Bryan Roberts, an analyst at Kantar Retail. ""Morrisons is showing a willingness to take on Asda in terms of an everyday low price position, rather than promotional activities,"" he said. Last week Sainsbury's announced a partnership with Denmark's Netto to launch discount stores in the UK. Retail experts are now watching to see how Tesco will react. It is also under pressure and Mr Roberts said recent discounts had ""arguably not gone deep enough or wide enough"". Tesco holds its annual general meeting on Friday.",Morrisons has announced further price cuts in its latest effort to win back customers and revive its business.
"The company announced the cuts, which will be carried out between 2014 and 2016, in a letter to its shareholders. RWE's latest reductions, along with previously announced cuts, mean the firm is shedding 18% of its workforce. The group said it did not have a figure for the number of cuts in the UK. Chief executive Peter Terium said: ""We will step up our efficiency measures significantly. By 2017, this will contribute an additional 1bn euros of savings."" RWE predicted its pre-tax profit for 2014 would fall from 2013, at between 7.6 and 8.1bn euros, compared to about 9bn euros this year.","German power giant RWE will cut 6,750 jobs across Europe and reduce costs by another 1bn euros (£840m), to help deal with low wholesale prices for energy and an increase in renewable capacity."
"Bohai Leasing will pay $31 per share in the deal that includes the assumption of debt and has a total enterprise value of about $7.6bn. The price is lower than the $32 discussed by the firms in August due to the ""volatility"" in the equity markets. Chinese leasing firms have expanded as local carriers introduce more routes. Most of them are backed by state-owned banks. The two companies had been in negotiations about a deal since July and shares of Avolon have risen more than 20% since the talks began. ""We believe Bohai will enhance Avolon's profile, positioning and relationships in the Chinese aviation market - a market which we believe offers one of the most compelling growth opportunities in global aviation over the next two decades,"" said Avolon chairman Denis Nayden in a statement. The Dublin-based company owned or managed 152 aircraft and had more than 100 more on order as of June.

"The Civil Aviation Authority said the process was now running smoothly after initial delays caused by high demand. Customers had complained they had tried to submit the claim form several times, but kept receiving error messages. The CAA blamed ""unprecedented demand"" and urged users to try later. In total, the aviation regulator has to refund some 360,000 customers. It will take 60 days for people to get their money back, the CAA said. ""We would like to thank Thomas Cook customers for their patience during the peak claims period earlier today,"" the CAA said in a tweet. Several people told the BBC earlier on Monday that they had completed the form, but when they tried to submit it they received a message telling them ""an unhandled fault occurred while processing this flow. Please contact your administrator"". Joly Shapley told the BBC he had tried to put in his claim at 08:16 BST, but with no success. ""At 8:20 am I called their helpline and after 10 minutes I got through to a call handler who... suggested I try later. She assured me [there was] no problem making multiple attempts but told me that she was not allowed to take my claim over the phone. ""Since then I have made seven further attempts to complete this online form. Sadly, although the CAA had extra time to prepare this process it appears to be too fragile for its purpose,"" he said. Sue Nicolson said she had tried to submit her claim a dozen times. ""The 60-day timescale for refunds only starts once they have received the claim, so how much longer are we going to have to wait for the thousands of pounds we are owed for a holiday we were supposed to depart for this Friday?,"" she said. The CAA said people who had paid by direct debit would get their money back by 14 October. Anyone who bought a package holiday with Thomas Cook will be covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). Customers would have received an Atol certificate when they booked. This means the cost of any holiday booked with the collapsed firm will be refunded. The CAA launched the refund website as the final flight bringing holidaymakers back by emergency repatriation landed on Monday morning. The few remaining passengers who did not return on a CAA-organised flight will have to make their own plans, although those covered by the Atol scheme will be refunded. CAA chair Dame Deirdre Hutton said she was ""deeply relieved"" that ""Operation Matterhorn"", the two-week operation to return 150,000 passengers to the UK after the package tour company collapsed last month, was over. ""Staff worked like Trojans 24 hours a day to help everyone, but that was only task one, now it's task two,"" she said, referring to the refund process. Staff left without pay Meanwhile, staff of the collapsed firm have not been paid for September and have to apply for their salary and redundancy related payments to the Insolvency Service's Redundancy Payment Service (RPS). About 9,000 staff in the UK were left jobless when the business failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal. The travel firm collapsed in the early hours of 23 September, after failing to obtain rescue funds from its banks. An inquiry has been launched by the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, with MPs focussing on the directors' stewardship of the company. The Financial Reporting Council, the accounting watchdog, will also investigate the auditing of the company.","Thomas Cook customers who had booked holidays with the firm have submitted 60,000 refund forms in the first hours of operation since a special website for the process was launched."
"The firm, employed by the government to cut tax credit fraud and overpayment, will, however, complete its current contract which expires in May 2017. In the eight months until then Concentrix will work on clearing outstanding cases, said HMRC. Concentrix said it had operated ""within the guidance set by HMRC"". ""The HMRC statement not to renew the contract attacks our professional credibility, and the commitment of our staff who have performed determinedly, despite the issues with HMRC policies and procedures,"" said a spokesperson. Concentrix won a £75m contract to try to save the government more than £1bn in incorrect or fraudulent tax credit payments in May last year. Wrongly accused But in a statement on Tuesday, HMRC's chief executive Jon Thompson said: ""While it's right that we ensure that tax credits customers only receive the money to which they're entitled, it is vital that those customers have a high level of service. ""That's why we have decided not to extend our contract with Concentrix and HMRC is redeploying 150 staff so that customers can get through to advisers and resolve any issues about their claim."" The Treasury has revealed 120 cases since last October where Concentrix did not ""fully"" meet the performance standards laid out in its contract. But it is feared the actual number may be higher. The Facebook campaign group Concentrix Mums, which has 5,600 members, says hundreds more people have been affected by errors. Labour MP and chairman of the Commons Work and Pensions Committee Frank Field, who had urged the government to investigate concerns over Concentrix, welcomed HMRC's decision, saying the firm's ""reign of terror"" was coming to a close. ""The government has acted decisively in protecting vulnerable Britain. This holds out huge prospects and, for some exploiters, horror, in the near future,"" he added. The BBC earlier reported the case of Nicola McKenzie, a teenage mother who had her child tax credits stopped after she was wrongly accused of being married to a 74-year-old dead man. Tax credits - the Child Tax Credit and the Working Tax Credit - are government payments made to households on low incomes. Concentrix's government contract is based on a payment-by-results model, with the ""maximisation of revenue flows"" as one of its key requirements - meaning it makes more money if it cuts more payments. But a spokesperson for the firm said it had not been incentivised to make wrong decisions for claimants. The spokesperson added: ""In-fact [we] would be penalised heavily for failure to adhere to HMRC policies and procedures. Through the term of the contract we are pleased to have saved the taxpayer nearly £300m in authentic confirmed tax fraud and error which otherwise would have cost the taxpayer money"".","Concentrix, the US firm accused of incorrectly withdrawing tax credits from hundreds of claimants, will not have its contract renewed, HMRC says."
"M&S could buy distribution centres and vans from Ocado, the Mail on Sunday reported. It has been exploring options for food delivery online in a bid to catch up with rivals such as Sainsbury's. Both companies declined to comment. Analysts suggested Ocado could stock M&S food or run its website. Ocado currently has a deal with southern England-focused Waitrose, which is due to come to an end in September 2020. M&S has been experimenting with home delivery since 2017, when it opened a trial in north London to offer a small range of ready meals. Its website already offers wedding cakes, party food and alcoholic drinks for collection, but it lacks a delivery network the likes of Tesco, Morrison, Sainsbury's or Asda have. After those earlier gains, Ocado shares settled to stand 3% higher at 975p. Marks and Spencer shares rose 2% to 295p. Two options M&S, founded in 1884, has been struggling in recent years to keep up online in both food and clothing. It said in November that sales excluding newer stores, were down 2.2% for the six months to the end of September. Food sales were down 2.9% and clothing and home sales slid 1.1%. A deal of any kind is not certain, the newspaper reported. If talks progress, there are two broad ways the two companies could work together, said Laith Khalaf, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. Ocado could take over running M&S's food website, handling logistics, payment and deliveries. This would be a similar deal to the one Ocado has with Morrisons. ""The challenge there is the economics of delivering basket sizes,"" says Mr Khalaf. M&S shoppers might buy a day or two's worth of food rather than a weekly shop, which makes the cost of delivery proportionately more expensive. The other option is for Ocado to carry M&S food, similar to its deal with Waitrose. This option is ""more economically viable"", he said, since it would mean less upfront expenditure from M&S.",Ocado shares rose as much as 6.7% after a report suggested it may agree a deal with Marks and Spencer to deliver its food and drink.
"John Flint is giving up the role he has held for a year-and-a-half ""by mutual agreement with the board"". He will immediately cease his day-to-day responsibilities at HSBC, but will help with the transition as Noel Quinn takes over as interim chief executive. Chairman Mark Tucker thanked Mr Flint for his ""commitment"" and ""dedication"". However, he said: ""In the increasingly complex and challenging global environment in which the bank operates, the board believes a change is needed to meet the challenges that we face and to capture the very significant opportunities before us."" HSBC made the surprise announcement as it reported a 15.8% rise in pre-tax profit to $12.4bn (£10.2bn) for the six months to 30 June. Mr Flint, who has worked at HSBC for 30 years, said: ""I have agreed with the board that today's good interim results indicate that this is the right time for change, both for me and the bank."" The 51-year-old ran the bank's retail and wealth management business before taking over as chief executive last year. At that time, Mr Flint was seen as a safe choice for the top job. HSBC portrays itself as a conservative bank. Unlike some rivals, it has never pursued the wilder excesses of investment banking, and has a proud record of appointing its chief executive and chairman from within. It is part of the establishment in Asia and the West, and makes its money from the giant trade flows between. With a 30-year track record at the bank, John Flint appeared the safest of hands when appointed 18 months ago. The bank's shares have fallen during his tenure, but the increasing trade tensions between America and China explain most of the fall. Mr Flint will be a ""good leaver"" - meaning he keeps his entitlement to most of his share options - and which rules out any idea his departure is linked to misconduct. Mr Flint was regarded as the favourite of his predecessor as chief executive, Stuart Gulliver - so it is possible that Mark Tucker, HSBC's chairman, has simply decided he wants his own man in the job. But the Huawei connection, although not confirmed by HSBC, cannot be discounted. In seeking to keep in the good books of the US authorities - which had a monitor embedded at the bank - HSBC provided the information that allowed America to apply for the extradition of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer. That cannot have pleased Beijing, and HSBC is reliant on China's goodwill as much as America's. Mr Flint may have been the necessary sacrifice. Commenting on the current environment, HSBC said ""the outlook has changed"". It said that US interest rates were now expected to fall rather than rise and ""geopolitical issues could impact a significant number of our major markets"". It added: ""In the near term, the nature and impact of the UK's departure from the European Union remain highly uncertain."" 'Good leaver' Mr Flint has a 12-month notice period, but it is not clear when his departure date will be, because he has ""agreed to remain available to HSBC"". HSBC has also granted Mr Flint ""good leaver"" status, which means he will be entitled to any stock options that vest after he exits the bank, provided he does not work at a competitor for two years. The bank said it has begun a search to find a new chief executive and ""will be considering internal and external candidates"".","The chief executive of HSBC has stepped down after the bank said it needed a change in leadership to address a ""challenging global environment""."
"By Matthew WallBusiness reporter, BBC News As the company's third chief executive in a year, the 37-year-old faces a string of major challenges as she sets out to revive this Silicon Valley giant. When David Filo and Jerry Yang founded Yahoo in 1994, they just wanted a way to keep track of cool stuff online. But their company quickly grew to become one of the internet's powerhouses and put Sunnyvale, California, on the map. A scattergun approach to development saw it being eclipsed, however, by more nimble and focused competitors, such as Google and Facebook. Analysts thought the founders stayed on too long, unable to translate their entrepreneurial start-up mentality into the more staid, corporate world. Yahoo is now commonly described as ""struggling"" and ""beleaguered"". But this is a company with 700 million users in 25 countries worldwide, 13,700 employees, and the fourth most popular website in the US. It should not be written off. 1. Rally the troops Yahoo started out as one of the internet's first search engines and content finders. Since then, employees have had to suffer the indignity of being overtaken by the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter. A series of embarrassing gaffes from the company has made matters worse. For example, the revelation in May that newly appointed chief executive Scott Thompson did not have the degree in accounting and computer science he claimed he had, earned the company embarrassing headlines and lost him his job. Ms Mayer will have the considerable task of convincing staff they do not work for a Silicon Valley has-been, but a powerful player capable of re-establishing itself in the pantheon of dotcom giants. Employees and shareholders alike are crying out for a period of stability and consistency of vision. 2. Improve financial performance Yahoo shareholders have had a tough time since the heady days of 2006, when the share price topped $43 (£27.50). Just two years later, the price had collapsed to $9. After a modest recovery, Yahoo has been flatlining. It now stands at about $16, still 41% down over the past five years. It was this continued poor performance that got chief executive Carol Bartz fired in September 2011, after two and a half years in the post. While Yahoo still has a chunky market capitalisation of $19bn, it must be galling for shareholders to see one-time takeover target Facebook being valued at more than $60bn, and Google at $187bn. Meanwhile Yahoo's year-on-year net income has fallen nearly 15% to a bit more than $1bn, on revenues down 21.19% to less than $5bn. Ms Mayer will have to restore the company's financials and give shareholders something to cheer about if she is to survive longer than her predecessors. 3. Focus Simon Hinde, former UK editorial director at Yahoo, says: ""Yahoo's main problem was that it didn't know what it wanted to be - a content provider or a software company. ""It went off in all directions and lost focus. The previous chief executive seemed to be positioning it as a media company, but [Ms] Mayer is an engineer, so will they revert to a software focus? ""Whatever direction she decides to go in, she just needs to focus on it and stick to it."" Ms Mayer seems to be hedging her bets, however. ""There's a very uninteresting debate happening around Yahoo between technology and media and it doesn't really make sense to me,"" she says. ""Because [when] you look at most major technology companies, media is a big part of its business."" The fact the Yahoo board describes the appointment as ""product-centric"" implies it wants the company to find its technological edge again, rather than simply repackaging and distributing third-party content. The good news for Yahoo is its brand is still one of the most recognised in the world. 4. Collaborate Ross Levinsohn, the former interim chief executive who was widely tipped to clinch the top job, had been positioning Yahoo primarily as a media company providing ""engaging social experiences"" and premium digital content. But will Mrs Mayer, who is a software engineer by background, decide to continue with this strategy? In July, Yahoo announced an advertising partnership with social-networking giant Facebook, and agreed to settle all patent disputes between the companies. Such content and advertising collaborations could prove to be essential if Yahoo is to catch up with its competitors. Yahoo has already integrated Facebook sharing capabilities on its sites, incorporating a Social Bar feature that 90 million people use to share news and content. It is this kind of collaboration, driving traffic and advertising revenue, that will help drive Yahoo's future success. A merger of the two companies, especially given Facebook's botched flotation in June, which saw $40bn wiped off the social-networking site's valuation in the space of a month, might well be high on Ms Mayer's wish list. 5. Jettison non-core businesses In May, Yahoo reached a deal with Alibaba Group to sell half of its 40% stake in China's biggest internet company for $7.1bn (£4.5bn). The move indicated Yahoo's attempts to refocus on its core business as a media content company and return some funds to its long-suffering shareholders. Yahoo will have to make sure any future acquisitions - if it can afford any, given its depleted resources - add to the company's bottom line and boost profits, not simply internet traffic.","As Marissa Mayer takes the reins at internet giant Yahoo, she inherits a company that has been eclipsed by its rivals and whose financial under-performance has angered shareholders for years."
"Petrol would now be 13 pence per litre cheaper than it would have been had the duty not been frozen over the last two years, he said. ""For a Vauxhall Astra or a Ford Focus, that's £7 less every time you fill up,"" he said. The level of the now-scrapped increase had not been announced. Fuel duty has not gone up since January 2011, when it was raised by 0.76p per litre. It was then cut by 1p in March 2011 and, ever since, planned increases have been postponed repeatedly. ""We've now frozen fuel duty for two years,"" Mr Osborne said. ""This has not been easy. The government has foregone £6bn in revenues to date."" The Chancellor also announced that he would extend a 100% first year tax allowance for buyers of ultra-low emission vehicles, as well as introduce new company car tax rates for the lowest emitting cars. ""From April 2015, two new company car tax bands will be introduced at 0-50g/km CO2 and 51-75g/km CO2,"" Mr Osborne said. Lower takings Fuel duty has risen from 45.82p per litre in March 2001 to the current 57.95p per litre. Hence, about 42% of the pump price ends up in the government coffers as duty. This rises to 59% once value added tax (VAT) has been added, according to the RAC Foundation. As such, petrol and diesel are amongst the main drivers of overall transport costs, according to the Office for National Statistics. In the 2011-12 financial year, the Treasury received £26.8bn from fuel duty, a near trebling of the £9.63bn fuel duty received in 1990-91. The fuel duty takings were lower, however, than they were during the previous year, when they peaked at £27.26bn. This was because 527 million fewer litres of petrol and diesel were sold, as individuals and companies chose to drive less, according to Edmund King, president of the Automobile Association (AA). 'No brainer' Consumer groups and industry bodies have welcomed the freeze. Both say higher fuel prices have curbed many people's driving and hurt the economy. ""This news provides breathing space for families being smothered by the soaring costs of motoring, especially the 800,000 households spending more than a quarter of their income on operating a vehicle,"" said Prof Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation. The AA's Mr King said ""76% of AA members are cutting back on journeys, household expenditure or both, due to the high cost of fuel"". However, FairFuelUK spokesman Quentin Wilson said more should be done. ""Cancelling a rise that really shouldn't happen is not enough. The government needs to cut duty substantially to get the economic growth we all need."" John Lewis, chief executive of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, said: ""This is almost becoming a no-brainer. With the economy flirting with recession and household incomes still falling in relation to inflation, the government just cannot afford to price businesses and households off the road."" Environmentalists were critical of Mr Osborne's approach. ""The driving force behind rising petrol prices is the soaring cost of oil,"" said Friends of the Earth economics campaigner David Powell. ""The sensible long-term plan is to protect motorists from rising fuel prices by weaning our transport system off its oil dependency.""","A rise in fuel duty scheduled for introduction in September has been cancelled, Chancellor George Osborne said in his Budget speech."
"Only £2bn of these £12bn cuts have been outlined so far, said IFS director Paul Johnson, in response to the Budget. Yet all the cuts are supposed to be in place by 2017-18, he said. Mr Johnson added that it was important to know ahead of the general election what ""radical changes"" were planned. 'Frustrating' Spending cuts planned for 2016-17 and 2017-18 would be ""twice the size of any year's cuts over this parliament"", said Mr Johnson, if the £12bn of cuts already announced and the Chancellor's hoped-for £5bn of anti tax avoidance measures failed to materialise. Budget 2015 Planned spending cuts £30bn in cuts by 2017 £13bn reduction in government departmental spending £12bn reduction in welfare spending £5bn tackling tax evasion & avoidance But, ahead of the election, the IFS said it had been left ""guessing"" how these cuts were going to be achieved, said Mr Johnson, admitting that the lack of detail was ""frustrating"". ""You're going to have to do things like further big cuts in child benefit, or really substantial cuts to housing benefit or significant cuts to disability benefits,"" he said. ""He's announced about £2bn [of cuts] and we know nothing about where the further £10bn are coming from."" ""He will have to implement some significant cuts in some significant benefits."" Our economics editor Robert Peston said: ""It won't remotely be easy to find that sum in the next few years. As the IFS points out, he has already made some of the simpler savings."" The IFS said that Labour and the Liberal Democrats would not cut spending as sharply, were they to win power, but government borrowing and debt would be reduced fastest under the Conservatives. Help to Buy ISAs The IFS warned that the new ""Help to Buy"" ISA [individual savings account] proposed by the chancellor could result in a temporary fall in first-time buyer activity in the housing market. This is because would-be buyers may delay property purchases to make the most of government top-ups. Under the proposed scheme, the government will add £50 for every £200 saved towards a deposit in the ISA. Stuart Adam, of the IFS, also speculated that the scheme could have an inflationary effect on house prices. Household incomes Commenting on the economic effect of the recession and the government's tax and benefit changes, Mr Johnson said UK households had experienced ""the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history"". While average household incomes have ""just about"" regained their pre-recession levels, the recovery had not been felt equally by all sections of society, he said. ""Average incomes among pensioners have risen, among those of working age they have fallen, with especially big falls for those in their 20s,"" said Mr Johnson. Earnings, taking the effect of inflation into account, have fallen, but should still be above their 2010 levels, he continued. There was some dispute in the Commons about how much better or worse off families have been in this parliamentary term. The chancellor said that households would be £900 better off in terms of all income 2015 than in 2010. Labour leader Ed Miliband said that people were £1,600 worse off in terms of workers' earnings in 2014 than in 2010. Mr Johnson said that ""there is much truth in both numbers"". ""Real earnings have fallen, as Mr Miliband says. Real incomes should be above their 2010 level as Mr Osborne says,"" he said ""We are for sure much worse off on average than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007 or indeed back in 2010."" The IFS concluded that the richest have been ""hit hardest"" by the government's tax changes over the last parliament. But it said that benefit cuts had ""hit low income working age people"". The chancellor's plan to increase the amount that can be earned before paying income tax - the personal allowance - to £11,000 by 2017-18 would benefit basic rate taxpayers by £48 a year by 2017-18 and higher rate taxpayers would benefit by an average of £72 a year, the IFS said. This plan would not be reversed under Labour.","Chancellor George Osborne needs to spell out exactly how he plans to cut £12bn from welfare spending, says the independent forecaster the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS)."
"By John MoylanIndustry correspondent, BBC News Around a third of former onshore oil and gas wells are leaking methane gas, according to the research led by scientists at the University of Durham. But it found the leaks produced less methane than agricultural use. The industry body said the findings should reassure people. ""What ReFINE has shown is that the public should have no health or environmental concerns about emissions from properly decommissioned wells adhering to current industry standards."" ""Indeed the research has found that in the minority of cases where they have recorded some methane emissions from decommissioned wells, these emissions are typically less than one would get from just a handful of livestock grazing in the same fields,"" said Ken Cronin, Chief Executive of UKOOG, the representative body of the UK Onshore Oil & Gas industry. Around 2000 onshore oil and gas wells have been drilled in the UK. Fracking for shale oil and gas could result in many more. Doug Parr, Chief Scientist at Greenpeace, says that's a worry given the levels of methane leakage uncovered in the study. ""If even an industry-funded study suggests that 30% of conventional wells appear to be leaking, it raises serious questions over the long-term impact of the extensive development of unconventional gas in the UK which is clearly the government's plan,"" he said. Methane Leakage The study sought to clarify how many former or decommissioned wells might be leaking methane. Tests were carried out at wells ranging from 8 to 79-years-old. Levels of the gas were tested at 102 locations which had previously been working oil or gas sites. The sites had all been decommissioned, which involves the wells being cut-off, sealed and buried to a depth of 2 metres. In the majority of cases, the methane levels were either lower than or comparable with that in nearby fields. But at 31 sites methane levels found at the soil surface were significantly higher than those found in control samples taken nearby. ""The point is that even with proper decommissioning you will still have those wells that leak as cement cracks and steel corrodes and so monitoring is important,"" said Professor Fred Worrall, from the Department of Earth Sciences at Durham University, who led the research. ""Overwhelmingly wells are properly decommissioned and our study shows that when methane does leak the levels are low, for example when compared to methane produced by the agricultural use of the land,"" he added. Leaks develop early At one former well at Hardstoft in Derbyshire, gas can be seen bubbling through a puddle at the surface. The Well was drilled in 1917 and abandoned before modern decommissioning regulations were in place. Methane levels here were more than 10 times higher than for average decommissioned wells. The study found that 40% per cent of the most recent wells surveyed showed leaks. This suggests that leaks develop early in the life of a decommissioned well. It also found that methane levels did not increase significantly with the age of the well since drilling. Water supply impact? The research did not examine the implications of methane leaks on the water supplies. In the US concerns have been raised about elevated levels of methane in water near fracking wells. The British Geological Survey is undertaking a National Baseline Methane Survey of groundwaters across the UK. Understanding the current groundwater levels of methane will provide a baseline against which any future changes could be measured. The research into methane leakage, led by the Durham University, is published on Tuesday in the journal ""Science of the Total Environment"". It is part of work carried out by the ReFINE project - which is led by Durham & Newcastle Universities - and which focuses on researching the potential risks of shale gas and oil exploitation. The project has been funded by UK research councils and agencies as well as firms involved in oil and gas exploration and fracking including Shell, Chevron, Ineos and Centrica.

"The protests, triggered by a row over disputed islands, saw Chinese consumers shun Japanese products. Honda's sales in China dipped by 40% in September. The carmaker has forecast a net profit of 375bn yen ($4.7bn; £2.9bn) for the financial year ending 31 March 2013. That is down from its earlier projection of 470bn yen. Honda's shares fell 4.7% to 2,399 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The firm said it expected income at its China unit to decline further in wake of the dispute between the two countries. Japanese firms usually release their earnings after the close of markets, but Honda posted its latest report on its website three hours ahead of schedule by mistake. Earlier this month, Google made a similar mistake and released its third-quarter results early, leading to trading in its shares being suspended for two-and-a-half hours. Further warnings? The protests in China followed Japan's purchase of islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, over which China claims sovereignty and which are also claimed by Taiwan. The protesters targeted Japanese brands and businesses associated with them. As a result, various Japanese firms including supermarket operator Aeon, Uniqlo owner Fast Retailing, carmaker Toyota and consumer electronics giant Sony suspended some of their operations in the country. Analysts said other Japanese carmakers may also lower their profit estimates. ""It's likely Toyota and Nissan are going to cut forecasts in the same way,"" said Fujio Ando, managing director at Chibagin Asset Management. ""A cut was to be expected because the problems with China weren't factored into forecasts."" Disaster recovery Meanwhile, the carmaker continues to recover from last year's natural disasters in Japan and Thailand. It reported a net profit 82.2bn yen in the three months to the end of September. That is a 36% jump from the same period last year. The firm said the recovery was driven primarily by increased car sales in the US and Japan, as well as the success of its new models. However, it warned that its performance in the coming months might be affected by a slowdown of sales in Europe. Several countries in the region have been hit by the debt crisis, which has led to a fall in consumer confidence and demand.","Honda has cut is annual profit forecast after anti-Japan protests in China hurt its sales in the country, its second-largest market."
"Colin Matthews, who apologised to MPs this week for the recent snow chaos at Heathrow, saw his pay rise to £971,000, according to BAA's annual report. BAA said the increase was because Mr Matthews now received pension payments directly, not into his pension scheme. On Monday he faced a Transport Select Committee hearing into Heathrow's failings during December's snow chaos. 'Overwhelmed' ""Colin Matthews' basic salary increased by 3.6% in 2010,"" said BAA. ""The numbers in the annual accounts reflect the fact that since April 2010, pension payments are paid directly to Mr Matthews and no longer to his pension scheme."" On Monday Mr Matthews admitted that Heathrow was ""overwhelmed"" by the amount of snow and accepted that communication with airlines could have been better during four days of huge passenger disruption. He said after the disruption that he would forgo his annual bonus. He still stands to receive a long-term incentive scheme bonus in 2012 if BAA meets performance targets.","The chief executive of BAA, which owns Heathrow airport, was given a £151,000 pay rise for 2010."
"By Ana Nicolaci da Costa Business reporter China is one of the world's top cotton producers and most of its crop is grown in Xinjiang. Rights groups say Xinjiang's Uighur minority are being persecuted and recruited for forced labour. Many brands are thought to indirectly source cotton products from the Xinjiang region in China's far west. Japanese retailers Muji and Uniqlo attracted attention recently after a report highlighted the brands used the Xinjiang-origin of their cotton as a selling point in advertisements. H&M, Esprit and Adidas are among the firms said to be at the end of supply chains involving cotton products from Xinjiang, according to a Wall Street Journal investigation. ""You can't be sure that you don't have coerced labour in your supply chain if you do cotton business in China,"" said Nathan Ruser, researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. ""Xinjiang labour and what is almost certainly coerced labour is very deeply entrenched into the supply chain that exists in Xinjiang."" What is happening in Xinjiang? UN experts and human rights groups say China is holding more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in vast detention camps. Rights groups also say people in camps are made to learn Mandarin Chinese, swear loyalty to President Xi Jinping, and criticise or renounce their faith. China says those people are attending ""vocational training centres"" which are giving them jobs and helping them integrate into Chinese society, in the name of preventing terrorism. What is produced in Xinjiang? The Xinjiang region is a key hub of Chinese cotton production. China produces about 22% of global cotton supplies, according to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). Last year, 84% of Chinese cotton came from Xinjiang, the report said. That has raised concerns over whether forced labour has been used in the production of cotton from the region. Nury Turkel, chairman of the Uighur Human Rights Project in Washington, said the Uighurs were being ""detained and tormented"" and ""swept into a vast system of forced labor"" in Xinjiang. In testimony to US congress, he said it was becoming ""increasingly hard to ignore the fact"" that the goods manufactured in the region have ""a high likelihood"" of being produced with forced labour. Which brands use Xinjiang cotton? Amy Lehr, director of CSIS Human Rights Initiative, said in many cases Western companies aren't buying directly from factories in Xinjiang. ""Rather, the products may go through several stages of transformation after leaving Xinjiang before they are sent to large Western brands,"" she said. Some, like Muji, are very open about sourcing material from Xinjiang. The Japanese retail chain launched a new Xinjiang Cotton collection earlier this year. One of its advertisements boasts ""soft and breathable"" men's shirts made from organic cotton ""delicately and wholly handpicked in Xinjiang"". Another Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo had also touted the Xinjiang region in an advertisement advertisment for men's shirts. In the fine print of the shirt description, the advert said the shirts were made from Xinjiang cotton, ""famous for its superb quality"". That reference was later removed from the advertisement ""given the complexity of this issue"", according to a spokesperson for Uniqlo. ""Uniqlo does not have any production partners located in the Xinjiang region. Moreover, Uniqlo production partners must commit to our strict company code of conduct. ""To the best of our knowledge, this means our cotton comes only from ethical sources,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. According to the Wall Street Journal report which focused on workers at a mill operated by Huafu Fashion in Aksu, Xinjiang, yarn made in the region was present in the supply chains of several international retailers including H&M, Esprit and Adidas. Many of the companies looked into the allegations, including those without clear links to the Huafu mill. In a statement to the BBC, Adidas said: ""While we do not have a contractual relationship with Huafu Fashion Co., or any direct leverage with this business entity or its subsidiary, we are currently investigating these claims."" ""We advised our material suppliers to place no orders with Huafu until we have completed those investigations,"" the Adidas spokesperson said. Esprit, which also does not source cotton directly from Xinjiang, said it had made several inquiries earlier this year. ""We concluded that a very small amount of cotton from a Huafu factory in Xinjiang was used in a limited number of Esprit garments,"" the firm said in a statement. The company has instructed all suppliers to not source Huafu yarn from Aksu, the statement said. H&M said it does not have ""a direct or indirect business relationship"" with any garment manufacturer in the Xinjiang region. ""We have an indirect business relationship with Huafu's spinning unit in Shanyu, which is not located in the Xinjiang region, and according to our data, the vast majority of the yarn used for our garment manufacturing comes from this spinning unit,"" a spokesperson for H&M said. ""Since we have an indirect business relationship with the yarn supplier Huafu, we also asked for access to their spinning facilities in Aksu. Our investigations showed no evidence of forced labor.""","Global retailers are facing scrutiny over cotton supplies sourced from Xinjiang, a Chinese region plagued by allegations of human rights abuses."
"Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said further research on the environmental impact was needed. A decision had previously been promised by the end of this year. Business groups reacted with dismay at the news, with one group describing it as ""gutless"", but opponents welcomed the extra focus on the environment. ""The case for aviation expansion is clear - but it's vitally important we get the decision right so that it will benefit generations to come,"" said Mr McLoughlin. ""We will undertake more work on environmental impacts, including air quality, noise and carbon."" An independent report on airport expansion by Sir Howard Davies in July backed a plan to build a third runway at Heathrow. But he said that the new runway should come with severe restrictions to reduce the environmental and noise effects, and did not completely rule out another runway at Gatwick or doubling an existing runway at Heathrow. This latest development means these two other options are still on the table and opponents argue the delay weakens Heathrow's position. Airport expansion - what are the options? Building a third runway at Heathrow Extending an existing runway at Heathrow Second runway at Gatwick Airport Heathrow Airport: Why the renewed delay? Why is it so hard to decide on major building projects? The government's Heathrow problem The politics of Heathrow expansion Gatwick described the delay as a ""defining moment"" in the airport expansion debate. ""We are glad that the government recognises that more work on environmental impact needs to be done,"" said its chief executive Stewart Wingate. ""Air quality, for example, is a public health priority and obviously the legal safeguards around it cannot be wished away,"" he added. And Heathrow Hub, the group behind the proposal for extending a runway at Heathrow, said the delay ""seemed sensible"". But Heathrow Airport said it had ""full confidence"" its plans could meet ""tough environmental conditions"" and would now ""move into the delivery phase"". Analysis: Richard Westcott, transport correspondent Plenty of business and union leaders will be frustrated at yet another delay to the airports' decision. But the government says it needs more time to pick a winner. Ministers want another six months to drill down into the impact any new runway will have on air quality and the people who'll live under the flight path. A cynic might point out it helps them out of a political hole. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said he would resign and force a by-election if they picked Heathrow. But he'll be tied up with the London mayoral election, which is to be held on 5 May 2016. Still, ministers do need to get this decision legally watertight. Campaigners around Heathrow have already told me they plan to take any expansion plans to court, and they think the impact of a bigger airport on local traffic pollution is their best chance of winning. Business groups reacted with anger at the delay. They argue that a lack of space at airports is damaging the economy. ""Business leaders will be tearing their hair out at the news that, yet again, a decision on expanding the UK's airport capacity has been delayed,"" said Simon Walker from the Institute of Directors. ""Of course this is difficult choice, which is the reason the government set up the Airports Commission to make a recommendation balancing economic needs, environmental concerns and the impact on local residents,"" he continued. ""We have to ask now, what was the point of the Commission if the government still fails to act?"" Meanwhile the business lobby group, the CBI said the decision was ""deeply disappointing"" and the British Chambers of Commerce described it as ""gutless"". But London Mayor Boris Johnson, a vociferous opponent of a third runway, said the Heathrow campaign was now officially grounded. ""The wheels are falling off the Heathrow fuselage and I think that, now the government has hit the pause button, they will begin to understand with ever greater clarity that, due to the environmental impacts, the legal obstacles and the cost to the public purse, this bird will never fly,"" he said. Conservative MP and London mayoral candidate Zac Goldsmith, who threatened to resign if the government picked Heathrow, said: ""We can't afford more dithering over aviation capacity. ""Gatwick stands ready to deliver it sooner, at a lower public expense and without the damaging impact of Heathrow expansion."" The delay means no decision will be made before next year's London mayoral election, to be held on 5 May. Labour's mayoral candidate, MP Sadiq Khan, told the BBC the delay was ""bad news for London's businesses"". ""What we should be doing is agreeing to a new runway at Gatwick Airport. Say no to Heathrow... This dithering and delay will mean problems in relation to growth,"" he added. Friends of the Earth was also among those who applauded the decision, saying it was ""clear you can't build a new runway and tackle London's toxic air pollution at the same time"".","A decision on whether to build a third runway at Heathrow Airport has been delayed until at least next summer, the government has confirmed."
"A study, commissioned by the European Commission, has identified up to 30 appliances including toasters and kettles which could be restricted. The study forms part of the EU's energy efficiency directive aimed at helping to tackle climate change. It follows a ban on powerful vacuum cleaners which begins on Monday. From 1 September, companies in the EU will be banned from making or importing vacuum cleaners above 1600 watts. Retailers said they had seen sales rise ahead of the deadline. Tesco said sales of vacuum cleaners had jumped 44% in the past fortnight, while Co-op Electrical has seen a 38% rise. The EU has now turned its sights to smaller electrical appliances which are not yet covered by existing legislation. ""We haven't got round to these devices yet, we want to curb power consumption,"" the EU energy commissioner, Guenther Oettinger, told Germany's Bild newspaper. 'Ill thought-out' However, an EU Commission spokeswoman said it may end up not regulating hairdryers at all. ""It's a study we have asked consultants to do. In the final report they will reduce 30 products to 20. In January 2015 we will look at these recommendations then select from this list what to regulate and how,"" she said. Industry body, the National Hairdressers' Federation (NHF), has urged the EU to reconsider, saying its plans are ""ill thought-out"". Former NHF president Mark Corary said a ban would not reduce energy consumption as it would mean blow-drying a client's hair would take longer. ""The more powerful, the faster the blow dry - it's as simple as that,"" he said.",High-powered hairdryers are on a list of household electrical items the EU is considering banning in an attempt to curb energy consumption.
"The Munich-based company said that net profits fell to 1.75bn euros ($1.92bn; £1.23bn) in the April-to-June quarter, down from 1.77bn euros a year earlier.

""If conditions on the Chinese market become more challenging, we cannot rule out a possible effect on the BMW Group's outlook,"" the carmaker said.

"House of Fraser (HoF) has said it needs to find fresh funding by 20 August, when payments to concessions in the stores need to be paid. An outcome from the discussions is expected before then. The store chain said all suppliers are being paid. But one supplier told the BBC if HoF went into administration, he would regain a fraction of what he is owed. House of Fraser employs 17,500 people - 6,000 directly and 11,500 concession staff. Around 6,000 jobs - 2,000 from House of Fraser and 4,000 brand and concession roles - will be lost as a result of a restructuring planned announced in June to close 31 of its 59 shops. House of Fraser has already issued a statement to thank ""all of its employees, suppliers and other stakeholders for their ongoing support"". A spokesperson for House of Fraser said: ""Suppliers have and are being paid as per their terms and conditions."" 'Willing to lose £20,000' Nigel Lugg, group executive chairman of Prominent Europe, which supplies Chester Barrie menswear to House of Fraser, said the company was still supplying clothes. Mr Lugg said that if House of Fraser went into liquidation his company would receive between 3p and 4p in the pound of what he is owed. ""And there is nothing you can do."" Suppliers are notoriously reluctant to discuss their relations with the companies that sell their products. The BBC contacted many who would not talk about the situation - even anonymously. Another supplier, who spoke to the BBC on condition he not be named, said he had been in business for 30 years but had never known the state of the retail industry to be so bad. He said he would not have an alternative store to go to if House of Fraser went under, saying: ""Who is there who is left? That is the trouble. Everybody seems to have a problem."" He said that he was sending the retailer one invoice at a time and only supplying more stock when that was paid. He said he was worried his August bill may not get paid. He added: ""I am willing to lose around £20,000 and you have got to take chances in this business, but nobody seems to know what is happening."" Another supplier, who also did not want to be named, said they were ""definitely concerned"", but that the situation was not yet having an impact on its decisions. Possible buyers? A key question is whether the business can be saved without being put into administration first. Among the potential investors in House of Fraser are Philip Day, the owner of Edinburgh Woollen Mills whose retail empire also includes Peacocks, Jane Norman, Austin Reed and Jaeger. Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who already owns an 11% stake in the department store business, is also in the frame. And the investment fund Alteri, an offshoot of US hedge fund Apollo, is said to be interested. House of Fraser's Chinese owners Nanjing Cenbest - also known as Nanjing Xinjiekou - had agreed to sell a 51% stake to the Chinese owner of Hamley's, C.banner. But earlier this month, C.banner pulled out of the deal to take the stake in the 169-year-old department store chain, leaving it and its creditors to seek alternative sources of finance. On Thursday House of Fraser told the Luxembourg stock exchange that ""discussions continue"" with potential investors. The talks are ""focused on concluding as quickly as possible to enable receipt of an investment required by no later than 20 August 2018"".",Suppliers to House of Fraser are among those anxiously awaiting the fate of the struggling department store chain.

The deal is the latest in a string of mergers in the drugs sector. It is also the largest by Roche since 2009 when it bought the remainder of Genentech for about $47bn. Pharmaceutical mergers Roche will pay $78 per share in InterMune, which is a premium of 38% on top of the value of the shares at the end of last week. Recent deals in the drug sector include US drug firm AbbVie's purchase of the UK pharmaceutical company Shire for £32bn. UK High Street chemist Alliance Boots was bought up by US pharmacy giant Walgreens in an agreement earlier this month.

"UK Financial Investments, through which the Treasury owns its four-fifths holding in RBS, may sell a stake worth billions of pounds, should there be enough appetite among City investors. The move is tentative, and could be set back a month or more. The Treasury and RBS declined to comment. The first task would be choosing investment banks to manage the sale. The coming week is seen as a good time to attempt a sale before holidays start in earnest among investors. Should there be too little interest, a sale could be attempted again from September, the BBC understands. Chancellor George Osborne announced in June his plan to sell the bank back to private investors. The government provided RBS with a £45.5bn bailout in 2008. The government paid about 500p a share for the bank, compared with the current price of about 342p. RBS reported a half-year loss of £153m last week after setting aside more money for repaying customers and potential legal settlements. But the bank's net profit rose to £293m for the three months to the end of June.","The Treasury could begin the process of selling part of the government's stake in Royal Bank of Scotland from Monday, according to BBC sources."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter Messy aisles. Missing products. Unhelpful staff. ""Sort it out"" would come the cry from millions of customers. Philip Clarke has even revealed that his dad was regularly on the phone, telling his 54-year-old son what's right and what's wrong with the local store in Liverpool. It would be fair to say that Mr Clarke ""was resigned"" this morning. Sacked is a word rarely uttered in boardrooms and the chairman, Richard Broadbent, was certainly careful not to use it. Party cancelled But the fact that Mr Clarke was preparing for a party to mark his 40th year at Tesco tomorrow night suggests that he did not see it coming. That party has now been cancelled. Mr Clarke told me this morning that he felt an ""enormous sense of relief"" that his resignation has happened. He said that it was clearly an ""emotional"" time but he had ""nothing to regret, only positive thoughts"". Friends had apparently been telling him that the last three years of change had taken their toll. I asked him directly whether it was his choice to leave at this moment, given that in recent interviews he has been talking about his desire to carry on until he was 60. His answer was somewhat Delphic. ""[The date] is not one of my choosing but it is a choice I would willingly make."" Mmmm. 'Heart-breaking' Mr Clarke revealed that the job had been tough. He said that he had found it ""heart-breaking"" to sell businesses in countries such as Japan and the United States' Fresh and Easy franchise. The turnaround programme he had put in place to make Tesco a multi-channel retailer had clearly taken its toll. ""You get attached to things,"" he said of why sometimes a board needs fresh blood. He was sticking to the line that this was good succession planning. Many would agree, but for a different reason. Analysts at Jefferies said this morning: ""In the space of a couple of weeks Tesco has rebuilt a strong management team. The addition of Dave Lewis as CEO to that of Alan Stewart as CFO [chief financial officer] creates more credible conditions for a turnaround of the group."" It is probable that Mr Stewart, who was announced as the new CFO last week, knew about Mr Clarke's departure before he did. Pincer movement When I was speaking to Mr Broadbent this morning, he was keen to say that Mr Clarke had done ""an extraordinary amount"". He also said that a ""fresh pair of eyes"" was necessary, which is where Mr Lewis comes in. I have written regularly before on Tesco's problems. The retailer was trapped in a pincer movement. From above, retailers such as Waitrose and Marks & Spencer had a more compelling offer. From below, Aldi and Lidl were eating Tesco's lunch as the UK's cheapest shop. Tesco appeared to be stuck in a cul-de-sac. The ""everything to everyone"" strategy via whichever shopping channel customers' desire (physical buildings or digital) will take a long time to bed in. In the meantime falling like-for-like sales was certainly making investors jittery. Looking at his time at Unilever, Mr Lewis is not a man afraid of making radical decisions. When he was head of Unilever's UK business he slashed the number of products it made from 1,600 to 400. In an interview with The Grocer in 2009, Mr Lewis said that Unilever, which had been suffering a decline in market share (sound familiar?) was ""old, respected and slightly deferential"". Choosers and users He also said that as a business it simply cost too much to run. Some 40% of costs were slashed, salaries were frozen and travel budgets cut. Mr Lewis is the man behind the launch of Dove and is now in charge of Unilever products such as Lynx and Simple. He certainly knows about the value of ""brands"" in crowded markets. Tesco sources say that the supermarket has to define what it is for. Customers have to want to use it rather than simply go in because it is present on every high street (""choosers rather than users"" in retail parlance). The biggest question for Tesco's shareholders will be Mr Lewis's lack of retail experience. With Mr Stewart, ex-M&S, he has help. But he will still have to prove that he can run such a huge business.",Tesco is Britain's biggest and most profitable retailer. To be its chief executive is to be in a job about which everyone has an opinion.
"Speaking in Beijing, he gave China ""credit"" for working to benefit its citizens by taking advantage of the US. He spoke alongside China's president Xi Jinping on Thursday, as the US leader continued his tour through Asia. The pair also signed $250bn (£190bn) worth of business deals. However, some of the agreements are non-binding, and it was not immediately clear how many represent new or final contracts. The US president, who is visiting Beijing as part of a 12-day Asian trip, has long decried his country's trade deficit with China. The total trade relationship between the pair was worth $648bn last year, but trade was heavily skewed in China's favour with the US amassing a deficit of $310bn. While still characterising the relationship as ""very unfair"" and ""one-sided"", Trump said on Thursday that China was not at fault, instead blaming previous US administrations. ""I don't blame China. After all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the sake of its citizens?"" he said during a signing ceremony for the business deals. ""I give China great credit,"" he added. Light on detail The $250bn of deals signed on Thursday included shale gas, liquefied natural gas and aviation projects. Executives from General Motors, GE and Goldman Sachs were among those at the signing ceremony. However, Deborah Elms, executive director of the Asian Trade Centre, cautioned over the true value of the deals. She said agreements announced on trade missions frequently include ""previously discussed items, things that are potential deals, items that might never come to pass and deals that will materialise in short order"". ""The headline figure is big and sounds good. It makes a splash. The details are less important, perhaps, to leaders,"" she told the BBC. Ms Elms also said the US president's apparent sympathies toward China on trade could fade. ""Trump has a history of being nice in person and immediately reverting to form once he leaves. I do not expect him to abandon his concerns about unfair China trade,"" she added. US-China deals On Wednesday, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross unveiled $9bn of business tie-ups between US and Chinese companies, though many are non-binding. The US-China deals announced this week include:","US President Donald Trump has said he does not blame China for the ""unfair"" trade relationship between the countries, despite long railing against the economic imbalance."
"The move is in line with President Donald Trump's ""America First"" trade policy, which aims to protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. A spokesman said the administration would ""always defend American workers, farmers, ranchers and businessmen"". But China and South Korea, whose manufacturers will be most heavily affected, criticised the move. US officials said more trade enforcement actions would follow. Mr Trump has talked about taking the action ever since coming to office. In his inauguration speech a year ago he promised to protect US borders from other countries ""making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs"". The actions are being seen as the president's most significant trade moves since his decision to pull the US out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal (TPP) and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Why have the tariffs been imposed? The tougher policy was approved by President Trump after the US International Trade Commission (ITC) found local manufacturers were being hurt by cheaper imports. Manufacturing companies - Whirlpool, a US-based maker of washing machines, and the solar firms Suniva and Solar World Americas - had complained to the ITC and it found in their favour. The tariffs set on solar panels were lower than domestic US producers had hoped for, but the duties on washing machines and parts were steeper than expected - adding as much as 50% in some cases, according to US documents. How will the tariffs work? The first 1.2 million imported large residential washing machines in the first year will have a 20% tariff imposed on them, while there will be a 50% tariff on machines above that number. By the third year, these will drop to 16% and 40% respectively. Figures suggest that in 2010, 1.6 million washing machines were imported to the US. Meanwhile, the tariff increase on imported solar cells and modules in the first year will be 30%, falling to 15% by the fourth year, although 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of imported cells - enough for about 11.5 million panels - will be allowed in tariff-free annually. The ITC said that China had been selling ""artificially low-priced"" solar components in the US, assisted by state subsidies. What does it mean for the solar industry? Taylor Kate Brown, BBC News, Washington The Trump administration has imposed these tariffs as part of a larger promise to protect American manufacturing - including the solar industry firms that brought the original complaint to the trade commission. But what the ""solar industry"" means in this context is complicated. The tariffs were opposed by America's largest solar industry group - the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). SEIA said Suniva and Solarworld had used the complaint to cover for bad business practices - and pointed out the two companies are actually foreign-owned even though the produce panels in the US. SEIA's position was also driven by the fact the group represents thousands of solar installers - an industry that's seen explosive growth, driven in part because of the dropping cost of panels. Firms that specialise in larger solar ""farms"" that sell their energy to US utilities are particularly worried about the decision, as they compete directly with coal, natural gas and wind producers. Ironically, the decision could mean more competition for Suniva and Solarworld, as several foreign firms may be interested in moving production to the US. What has the reaction been? US appliance maker Whirlpool, which for years has sought protection against cheaper imports from South Korea and Mexico, welcomed the move. ""This announcement caps nearly a decade of litigation and will result in new manufacturing jobs in Ohio, Kentucky, South Carolina and Tennessee,"" chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. Shares in Whirlpool rose 2.5% on the news, and it immediately announced it would employ 200 more people. Shares in US solar panel manufacturers also went up. Environmentalists argue that making solar panels more expensive risks holding back the development of renewable energy in the country. China and South Korea have reacted angrily to the news. South Korea said it would complain to the World Trade Organization (WTO), calling the tariffs ""excessive"" and ""regrettable"". Its manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, compete in the washing machine market with US firms such as Whirlpool. Samsung called the tariffs ""a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine"". Meanwhile China, the world's biggest solar panel manufacturer, said the move would further damage the global trade environment. China is the US's biggest trading partner and government spokesman Wang Hejun said that Beijing expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the plans. He warned that ""together with other WTO members, China will resolutely defend its legitimate interests"" adding that the plans ""not only aroused the concern of many trading partners but was also strongly opposed by many local governments and downstream enterprises in the US"".",The US has approved controversial tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels.
"French firm EDF, which is financing most of the £18bn project in Somerset, approved the funding at a board meeting on Thursday. The government then said it was ""only right"" to review the project and would make a decision by the autumn. Contracts were supposed to have been signed on Friday. The BBC's political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said because of the change of government and the significance of the project, Number 10 felt it was perfectly reasonable to re-visit the deal. ""As I understand it, the PM's team believe it was not for them to say in advance of the EDF board meeting what their thinking was. ""The company might have wanted the UK government to make its position clear first but Mrs May was not going to be bounced into it. ""I'm being told we should not over interpret the review - there's a sense of reassurance rather than policy being ripped up to start all over again,"" our correspondent added. Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Kamal Ahmed: Why did the chancellor tell me Hinkley 'will go ahead' five days ago? Carrie Gracie: Is China the hitch for Hinkley Point? Somerset hopes for Hinkley jobs boost Hinkley Point: What is it and why is it important? Jean-Bernard Levy, EDF Group chief executive said he remained confident the project would go ahead. ""I have no doubt about the support of the British government led by Mrs May."" 'Dithering and delay' But Justin Bowden, the GMB union's national secretary for energy described Mrs May decision as ""bewildering and bonkers."" ""After years of procrastination, what is required is decisive action not dithering and more delay. ""This unnecessary hesitation is putting finance for the project in doubt and 25,000 new jobs at risk immediately after Brexit"". Labour's shadow energy secretary, Barry Gardiner, said there was a role for nuclear power as part of a low carbon future, but the government's handling of the situation had been ""absolute chaos"". ""At a day's notice they have cancelled the final signing of the agreement that they told the press and everyone they were going to do. ""I'm hoping what they will do is take two to three months to seriously review it,"" Mr Gardiner added. Analysis: John Moylan, BBC Industry Correspondent EDF's decision yesterday to back Hinkley Point was expected to be swiftly followed on Friday by the government and the French firm signing the key contracts that underpin the deal. Instead government sources say with a new leadership in the country it is right to consider this huge infrastructure project. They add that a timetable has been agreed with the stakeholders in the project. But EDF and the government had briefed journalists in recent days that these key contracts would be signed today. Sources have told me that Chinese officials - here to sign up to their stakeholding in Hinkley - will now be returning home. There's no suggestion that the new government is going cold on this long delayed project. But the events of the last 24 hours will send mixed signals about Britain being open for business in the wake of the referendum vote. China concerns One third of the £18bn cost is being provided by China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) which has reiterated its support for the project. But a source close to CGN has told the BBC that everyone in the company was ""bemused"" by the sudden nature of the government's announcement and had been given no real insight into the reason for the delay other than being informed it was something the prime minister wanted. It was also frustrated that the government had allowed speculation about national security concerns to continue. Nick Timothy, who is a close adviser to Mrs May, has previously raised serious concerns about Chinese investment in areas that could threaten Britain's security. Last year, the chancellor at the time, George Osborne, said investment in Hinkley Point could lead to the Chinese designing and constructing a new nuclear reactor at Bradwell in Essex. At the time Mr Timothy wrote on the Conservativehome website that if that happened experts feared China could ""build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will"". 'Enormous deal' Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Conservative MP whose constituency includes Hinkley Point, said Mrs May was doing exactly the right thing. ""We're talking about three countries, we're talking about an enormous deal for the United Kingdom, for France and for China. She (Theresa May) wants to make sure it's the right job and that's what she's doing."" Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. Britain has committed to pay a price more than twice the current market levels for the power generated by the plant over 35 years. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""Theresa May now has a chance to stop this radioactive white elephant in its tracks. ""She should look at the evidence and see that this deal would be a monumental disaster for taxpayers and bill payers. ""The UK needs to invest in safe, reliable renewable power."" But Malcolm Grimston, a senior research fellow at Imperial College London, said the case for Hinkley Point C had not changed and the arguments for it remained strong. ""My own view is gas prices cannot stay at artificially low levels forever on the back of the oil price collapse, as it is at the moment. ""We need to invest in something more rapidly because so many of our power stations are reaching the end of their lives."" 'Yet another blow' Tom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible. ""We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies,"" he said. ""Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments."" Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. During morning trading on the Paris stock exchange, EDF's share price rose 8%. Shareholders appear to have been buoyed by EDF's continuing confidence in the deal. Hinkley Point timeline Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £92.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the time Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.","The government's surprise announcement to delay a final decision on Hinkley Point has been described as ""bonkers"" by the GMB union and ""chaos"" by Labour."
"The purchasing managers' index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS showed activity rose to 55.1 in June, up from 54. IHS chief business economist Chris Williamson said the reading added to signs that the economy rebounded in the second quarter. He said it ""opens the door for an August rate hike"". Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion rather than a contraction. IHS Markit estimated that UK gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 0.4% in the three months to June, compared with a 0.2% rise in the first three months of the year. Mr Williamson said: ""The sharp rise in business costs, linked to surging oil prices and the need to offer higher wages, suggests inflation will also pick up again from its current rate of 2.4%."" Activity in the UK services sector makes up nearly 80% of the UK's GDP. The survey of purchasing managers found that new work increased strongly in June, in particular for business and financial services. Overall, activity grew at the strongest pace since October 2017. It follows better than expected growth in the UK construction sector for June, according to IHS Markit/CIPS, and also a modest increase for manufacturing during the same month. ""Nonetheless, there were again reports that Brexit-related uncertainty had held back business investment, particularly in relation to spending by large corporate clients."" Howard Archer, an economist with the EY Item Club, said: ""The improved services survey completes an overall stronger set of purchasing managers' surveys pointing to the economy warming up in June.""","The UK services sector reported its fastest rise in activity since last October, increasing expectations of an imminent interest rate rise."
"The company said profits for 2017 could drop by £60m and it would cut its dividend for shareholders. ""The education sector is going through an unprecedented period of change and volatility,"" Pearson said. The group will now sell its 47% stake in the book publisher Penguin Random House to bolster its finances. In a trading update, Pearson revealed a sharp and sudden drop in its main business - the sale of printed and online books to higher education students in the US. Pearson said it had suffered a 30% fall in sales in the last three months of 2016, producing an ""unprecedented"" 18% fall for the whole of 2016. ""Our higher education business declined further and faster than expected in 2016,"" it revealed. ""We estimate 2% of this decline was driven by lower enrolment, particularly in Community College and amongst older students; 3-4% by an accelerated impact from rental in the secondary market; and approximately 12% due to an inventory correction in the channel reflecting the cumulative impact of these factors in prior years,"" the company explained. The result was an 8% fall in sales for the whole group during last year. Penguin sale Pearson now expects the downward trend in its educational publishing business to continue during this year with profits for 2017 likely to be £60m lower than last year. One step to stem this trend will be to cut its eBook rental prices by as much as 50% for 2,000 titles. But one eye-catching change will be the sale of its near-half stake in the huge international book publisher Penguin Random House. The company was formed in 2013 with the merger of Penguin - owned by Pearson - and Random House - owned by the German publishing group Bertelsmann, and which still owns 53% of the enlarged book publisher. Bertelsmann may now buy some or all of Pearson's stake in the book publisher. In recent years Pearson has concentrated mainly on educational publishing and in 2015 sold both the Financial Times and its half-stake in the Economist. George Salmon, an analysts at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said the dividend cut was ""startling"". ""With the group fearing that textbooks and other educational equipment would enter terminal decline, Pearson took the bold step of changing tack,"" he said. ""The group pinned its hopes on online and virtual courseware, and in 2015 sold off assets such as the Financial Times and Economist newspapers to generate the cash to hold the dividend steady through the transition. ""Those sales don't look too smart now,"" he added. At midday, shares in Pearson were trading at 567p, down 29.8%.",Shares in the international publishing group Pearson fell nearly 30% after the company warned of a big fall in sales in its US education business.
"Stephen Barclay told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the project was vital for ""levelling up"" the UK's transport network and improving capacity. The Brexit secretary's comments come amid a row over the rising cost of the project, which could reach £106bn. The first phase of the project is due to link London and Birmingham, followed by extensions to Leeds and Manchester. Mr Barclay was asked by Andrew Marr for his ""gut feeling"" about whether the HS2 would be approved. ""Yes"", he replied firmly. He said the government had given a ""clear commitment to level up all parts of the United Kingdom... HS2 plays an important part in that"". That levelling up was not just about improving the speed of transport, but also improving capacity in the UK. Mr Barclay stressed, though, that it was ""important that we also get value for money"". Earlier this month, a leaked government-commissioned review suggested the total cost of HS2 could reach £106bn. The findings of the independent review, conducted by former HS2 Ltd chair Doug Oakervee, have not yet been officially published. The Department for Transport has indicated it will be published soon. Lord Berkeley, a vocal critic of HS2 who was deputy chairman of the Oakervee review before withdrawing his backing, published an independent assessment of the project. He put the cost at at least £108bn, adding that the government should scrap the project to concentrate on improving the rail network in the north of England. That drew criticism from northern political leaders and businesses, who said HS2 should be built in its entirety. Whitehall's spending watchdog said last week that HS2 is over budget and behind schedule because its complexity and risks were under-estimated. The National Audit Office (NAO) warned that it is impossible to ""estimate with certainty what the final cost could be"". HS2 was allocated £56bn in 2015. Phase One between London and Birmingham was due to open in 2026, but full services are now forecast to start between 2031 and 2036. Construction firms have warned that scrapping HS2 would cause major damage to the industry, while several environmental groups say going ahead with the project will have a huge impact on natural habitats and ancient woodland. The Sunday Telegraph reported that former senior figures involved in HS2 have given signed statements to the prime minister's advisers, alleging the government-owned firm behind HS2 covered up spiralling costs on multiple occasions. In a statement, HS2 responded: ""Following the collapse of Carillion, HS2 Ltd recognised the need to engage a healthy industry while continuing to protect value for money for the taxpayer. ""Instead of artificially passing risk back and forth, as has happened on other publicly-funded projects, contractors who do not meet the required performance will lose a proportion of their fee. ""This incentivises good performance and also prevents windfall profits from public money."" The statement said that by revising the terms and conditions, ""contractors have been able to reduce their prices and HS2 Ltd estimates £1bn of savings as a result"". By Peter Saull, BBC political reporter: HS2 is the talk of Westminster at the moment. Will it get the go ahead or come off the rails? Or somewhere in between? Perhaps unsurprisingly, the government is at pains to avoid saying what might happen next. Ministers don't want to pre-empt the findings of the Oakervee review, which despite a series of leaks, is yet to be officially published. Steve Barclay has gone further than any of his Cabinet colleagues by revealing he has a hunch that the project will get the green light. But it's unclear how much insight he has. While the Brexit secretary has a seat at the Cabinet table for now, he might not be there for too much longer. The Department for Exiting the EU will be wound up following the UK's departure this week. Ultimately the decision on HS2 lies with Boris Johnson, in consultation with his chancellor and transport secretary.",A cabinet minister has told the BBC it is his gut feeling that the HS2 high-speed rail line will get the go-ahead.
"For most of this summer I'm on ""worliday"". This is a new word I have just made up to describe something I've been doing for a few years, and now seems in need of a name. Worliday is a bit like holiday and a bit like work. It's the future for most professional workers - and actually, contrary to what most people would have you believe, worliday is really rather nice. Here is the sort of thing I did when I was on worliday 10 days ago in north Cornwall. I would wake up, do a few emails and then go for a walk by the sea. Later, I might write an article sitting under a window with a view of a stream. After that, I'd go outside to light the coals to barbecue a sausage. Cold turkey Most people will tell you that worlidays are psychologically unhealthy. It is surely terrible that we are all chained to Blackberrys and in touch with offices even when supposedly having a break in the sun (or rain). Taking time off completely, stress experts say, is essential if we are to connect with our families and with our souls and recharge our batteries. But in my experience it doesn't work quite like this. A human battery is a funny piece of kit, and doesn't always respond well to a sudden, cold-turkey immersion in idleness with the family in a strange place. Intellectual stimulation charges my batteries more reliably than sitting in the rain with bored teenagers. Back in the old pre-internet days when holidays represented a forcible break from work there was a wild dash to get everything done before you left. Then you arrived at your destination shattered and with a mind stuffed full of work concerns. It used to take the first week to relax and stop worrying about what was happening at work. By the time you had stopped fretting, it was time to go back to work, and then further discombobulating acclimatisation was required in the other direction. No records The first great thing about the worliday is that there is no stark transition between the two states. Better still, the worliday means you should be able to go away more often to compensate for the fact that you are still (sort of) working when absent. However, the mass adoption of the worliday doesn't mean everyone ought to be given longer holiday entitlements. It means that holiday entitlements should be scrapped altogether. The current arrangement only makes sense for people who work fixed hours - they clearly need fixed holidays too. But for professionals who have not worked set hours for decades, fixed holidays seem an anachronism. Netflix, which has a famously groovy culture, worked this out some time ago. Its employees are allowed to take whatever holiday they feel like taking - no-one keeps records. And on that happy note, I'm about to pack my bags and head off cheerfully with my family to Yorkshire for a few days. In my suitcase will be my sunglasses and Wellington boots - as you never know with the weather up there - as well as my Blackberry and computer.","Has the arrival of smartphones, laptops and mobile internet fundamentally changed the way people should take holidays? Lucy Kellaway of the Financial Times thinks it has."
"The statement will set departmental budgets for just one year rather than the usual three years, due to uncertainty over the impact of Brexit. Mr Javid will announce a further £2bn of Brexit funding for the government, as well as confirm additional funds for health, schools and the police. The extra spending will be funded by borrowing rather than tax rises. Independent think-tank the Institute for Government (IFG) says the government is likely to favour vote-winning measures ahead of a ""potentially imminent"" election. But it argues the government should be prioritising other areas of spending, such as social care and prisons which it says are the services most in need of extra money. Here we look at each of the public services, and which needs the most funding, according to the IFG's report. It has graded services, according to need based on which are able to keep up with demand: amber for some concerns and red for significant concerns. Health What has already been announced? Theresa May's government announced that annual funding would rise by £20 billion by 2023. Boris Johnson also announced a one-off injection of £1.8bn, but not all of that is agreed to be new money. Spending on hospitals and GP services in England has risen since 2009-10, although more slowly than in the past. IFG estimates suggest that the workload of GPs has risen faster than spending, meaning they have had to do more for less. Despite practices increasing the number of telephone consultations and pooling resources, patients have been waiting longer for appointments. This suggests that GPs, despite becoming more efficient, have not been able to keep up with demand. However, the amount of work hospitals do has risen faster. While hospitals have made efficiencies, hospitals have not been able to keep pace with the growing cost and demand for care, according to the IFG. The result has been financial deficits and longer waiting times for treatment. The frontline of the NHS knows what its budget is until 2023-24: it was given a five-year settlement last summer. The rises, an average of 3.4% a year, are generous compared to what the rest of the public sector can expect and reflect the fact the health service is constantly among the top priorities for voters and facing rising demand from the ageing population. But there are still question marks around more than £13bn of funding that goes to things like staff training, buildings and healthy lifestyle initiatives, such as stop smoking. Schools What has already been announced? The government has announced that funding will rise by £2.6bn in 2020-21, £4.8bn in 2021-22 and £7.1bn in 2022-23. Schools in England have not faced the same financial pressures as many other public services, according to the IFG. However, after a rise in spending per pupil in most years since 2009-10, since 2014-15 the growth in pupil numbers has outpaced spending growth, meaning the per-pupil spending has fallen in both primary and secondary schools. On top of this, schools have increasingly been paying for services that would have been previously provided by local authorities - such as educational psychology and extra support for special educational needs - following cuts to local authority budgets. There are also signs that this increased workload is putting pressure on the workforce, with schools finding it harder to recruit and retain teachers, the IFG says. But overall, schools have become more productive, it adds, with more pupils per teacher and pupil attainment increasing - particularly in primary schools. School funding in England had become a political headache and vote loser for the government, with both headteachers and parents campaigning. Rising costs such as national insurance and teachers pensions, as well as running costs such as utility bills, have contributed to an 8% real terms reduction in money spent in schools since 2010. The extra money promised for 5-to-16 year-olds' education will almost reverse that squeeze by 2023. But that leaves financial pressures in England in other areas such as early years, and despite some extra cash for colleges educating 16-19 year-olds, an historic legacy under many governments of relative underfunding of further education. Police What has already been announced? The government has promised 20,000 extra police officers over three years at a likely cost of £0.5 billion next year but has not yet confirmed how this will be funded. Spending on the police in England and Wales has fallen sharply since 2009-10, says the IFG. The number of police officers has also declined, with total police reserves now 9% lower in real terms than they were in 2009-10. ""Victim-reported crime has fallen over this period, but police-recorded crime has increased,"" the IFG says. ""Overall police performance - as judged by inspection reports - has improved, although other indicators - such as public confidence in the police and the length of time taken to bring charges - have deteriorated. ""There is evidence that the police are struggling to maintain performance with current levels of spending."" The strength of policing reached a record high at the end of the Labour government that left office in 2010 - and then fell back by 21,000 as older officers left and cuts restricted recruitment. The prime minister's pledge to re-recruit 20,000 officers in the coming three years is a huge task, because natural loss means forces may need to recruit more than double that number to hit the target. Prisons What has already been announced? £0.1 billion pledged to boost security; promise of 10,000 extra prison places, but funding arrangements unclear Prisons have experienced large spending cuts and a reduction in staff numbers since 2009-10. This means prison safety has declined dramatically since 2012-13, according to the IFG. Violence has risen and prisoners are less likely to have access to learning and development activities. The 2016 Autumn Statement saw an injection of extra cash to tackle these safety issues and spending has risen again recently. As a result, staff numbers are starting to rise again. The IFG hailed a pilot programme to curb violence and drug use in 10 prisons, undertaken last year by the then Prisons Minister, Rory Stewart. ""This was largely successful, but replicating it across the whole prison system will require extra spending in every future year,"" the IFG says. The Ministry of Justice was one of the first big spending departments to settle with the Treasury in 2010, when the then Chancellor, George Osborne, demanded major cuts to public spending. Today, it has 25% fewer staff than back then. The departure of experienced prison officers under the cuts coincided with a rise in smuggling of new psychoactive drugs into jails, leading to an increase in violence that the remaining prison officers struggled to control. Adult social care What has already been announced? In a Sunday Times interview, Boris Johnson said he would give councils £1bn for adult social care, but no formal announcement has yet been made. Spending on adult social care in England fell between 2010-11 and 2014-15, but has since seen a rise. The number of adults receiving publicly funded care packages has decreased, according to the IFG, even though an ageing population would suggest that demand is increasing. Local authorities, responsible for providing adult social care, have driven down the price of care commissioned from private and voluntary sector providers following cuts to funding. However, this has not enabled them to meet demand, the IFG says, and unpaid care - such as by family, friends or neighbours - has partially filled the gap. In his first speech from Downing Street, Boris Johnson promised to ""fix the crisis in social care once and for all"". However, the IFG says there are no signs that plans to do so will be unveiled in the Spending Review. Not only has adult social care lost out in terms of funding, the long-awaited reform of the system has also been dodged. Care services for the elderly and disabled simply do not have the profile of the NHS, although that is beginning to change a little as the problems worsen. But the challenge remains what to do about money. Only the poorest and neediest get support from the state. But that means four-fifths of older people who need care go without, rely on family and friends or pay for it themselves. Each of the areas covered by the IFG's report are devolved: the governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland run their own services. So announcements on Wednesday will effect England (or England and Wales for policing and justice). The devolved governments will receive extra money proportionate to the increases in spending, but they will decide how that money is spent. Since 2010, the Westminster parliament has increased health spending faster and cut education and local government spending faster than the devolved governments.",Chancellor Sajid Javid is set to unveil the government's spending plans for the coming year on Wednesday.
"Retail sales plunged by 10% and capital investment fell by 8.4% in the economy's worst performance since 2009. In contrast, Russian GDP increased by 0.6% in 2014. The economy has been hit hard by the extraordinary collapse in oil prices, which have fallen by 70% in the past 15 months. Sanctions imposed by the West after Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014 have also had an impact. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev warned earlier this month that the fall could force Russia's 2016 budget to be revised. President Vladimir Putin said in December that the budget had been calculated based on oil at $50 a barrel. Oil is trading at just over $30 a barrel. Analysis: Steven Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent ""We're not panicking!"" This was one of the headlines in Russian TV's Sunday news review. The words appeared on a giant video screen behind the anchor, along with a picture of rouble coins. Russia may not be panicking, but it's clearly worried. Worried enough for the pro-Kremlin media here to admit there's a problem: a full-blown economic crisis. The state-controlled media blames the crisis, principally, on low oil prices and, to a lesser extent, on western sanctions. What you don't hear on TV is anyone blaming President Putin for the problem. Yet, in the decade and a half that Mr Putin has ruled Russia as president or prime minister, Russia failed to prepare for the possibility of low oil prices and did little to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on energy exports. Russian citizens are increasingly concerned. Inflation is rising, so is the fear of job losses. Meanwhile, real incomes in Russia are falling and social benefits are being cut. Earlier this month senior citizens blocked streets in Sochi and Krasnodar to protest against the scrapping of free travel passes for pensioners. People power persuaded the local authorities to reverse the decision. The longer Russia's economic woes continue, the greater the likelihood that social protest here will spread. Oil prices in reverse amid Opec production call Taxes from oil and gas generate about half the Russian government's revenue. William Jackson, an economist at Capital Economics, said: ""While the worst of Russia's crisis has now passed, the economy is still extremely weak. The latest fall in oil prices and drop in the rouble mean the likelihood of a second consecutive year of recession is rising."" Rouble trouble The rouble fell to record lows against the US dollar last week, before regaining some ground as oil prices recovered slightly. The currency was down more than 1% on Monday at 78.87 after oil prices fell about 3%. Economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev said he expected the Russian central bank to leave interest rates on hold at 11% when it meets on Friday. Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the central bank, said last week that authorities had ""all the means"" needed to keep the economy stable. Unemployment in Russia was steady at 5.8% in December, meaning that 4.4m people were out of work, and real wages fell by 10%. Despite the gloomy economic news, fast food giant McDonald's said on Monday it planned to open more than 60 restaurants in Russia this year. Khamzat Khasbulatov, chief executive of McDonald's Russia, said sanctions and the weak rouble had forced the US company to make ""serious adjustments"" to its business model, but focusing on local suppliers and affordable menus had proved successful. ""We have seen significant growth of our market share as we continued expansion,"" he said. ""The development of local supply has played a big role in supporting our profitability.""","Russia's economy contracted by 3.7% in 2015, according to preliminary figures published by the country's statistics service."
"Adoboli was expected to be put on a charter flight late on Tuesday, but a judge has awarded a last-minute judicial review of his case. The reprieve will last ""until such time as the outcome of the review is determined"", the judge said. Adoboli served four years of a seven-year sentence for a £1.4bn fraud. He was released in 2015 and spent time since in a mixture of paid and unpaid work which his lawyers had argued was aimed at sharing the lessons learned from his experience. He has delivered training to people in the banking industry and to civil servants, and was staying in Livingston, West Lothian, prior to his detention. He is currently being held at Harmondsworth Immigration Removal Centre near Heathrow, but attempts are now being made to secure bail for him. Campaigner and friend Nick Hopewell-Smith said ""common sense"" had prevailed. ""Kweku Adoboli may have been born elsewhere, but he is more British, with more loyalty to Britain, than many people with a passport,"" he said. That loyalty had been ""severely tested"" by the actions of the Home Office, he added. Adoboli left Ghana at the age of four and has lived in the UK since he was 12. Since he was detained on 3 September, almost 75,000 people have signed a petition against his deportation, with more than 130 members of the UK and Scottish parliaments signing a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid asking him to intervene. Immigration minister Caroline Nokes had said earlier in a letter that all foreign nationals sentenced to more than four years' imprisonment were subject to automatic deportation, unless there were compelling reasons for them to remain. The public expected ""robust action"" to be taken against foreign nationals who had committed crimes, she wrote. Adoboli was found guilty for booking fictitious trades to cover up big losses during the financial crisis between 2008 and 2011. He pleaded not guilty, saying his senior managers knew what he was doing and encouraged him to take risks.","Kweku Adoboli, the former UBS trader convicted of fraud, has been given a temporary reprieve from deportation to Ghana, where he was born."
"By Richard AndersonBusiness reporter, BBC News Only time will tell if the care home operator's unilateral decision to cut its rental payments by a third will prove foolhardy, but it had little choice - high rents lie at the very heart of the company's problems. The root of Southern Cross's current troubles lies in its decision, in 2007, to list itself on the London Stock Exchange. In the process, it sold most of its property freeholds and then leased them back - ""a unique business model borne out of credit euphoria"", according to Henry Dixon, fund manager at Matterley. Rents were inflation-linked - and could only rise. ""This looked OK at the time,"" says William Laing at healthcare analysts Laing & Buisson, but with inflation rising sharply in the past two years, Southern Cross has felt the pinch. The result is an unsustainable £180m going out each year in rent, which has undermined the company's ability to invest in its homes. Under-investment The very nature of the business model itself has also impacted on investment, some observers suggest. ""Southern Cross was set up as a [property investment vehicle]; there was no real focus on management and quality,"" says Mr Laing. The resulting under-investment affected occupancy levels as its homes suffered by comparison with those run by competitors, he says. This disparity was highlighted when the Care Quality Commission introduced star ratings of care homes - poor, adequate, good and excellent. ""Southern Cross runs a higher number of poor and adequate-rated homes,"" says Mr Laing. However, the commission says this simply reflects the large number of homes that Southern operates. The company itself simply says that it has made ""significant progress in the operational turnaround of the business"", including investing in new services - such those dealing with dementia. Either way, the business model laid the foundations for the huge rental payments the company now faces. Not only was there less cash left for investment, but Southern Cross was forced to charge higher fees to compensate, again hitting occupancy rates. Fee cuts While Southern was contending with the double whammy of paying out more in rent each year and taking less in fees, another problem, quite beyond its control, struck hard. Arguing that it needed to dramatically cut the UK's budget deficit, the government announced it would introduce swingeing spending cuts. As a result, local authorities were forced to cut the fees they were willing to pay for care home residents. The cuts hit Southern Cross harder than most. Across the sector as a whole, privately-paying residents make up about 42% of all those being cared for, Mr Laing explains. But at Southern, the figure is about 20%. Fee income, therefore, took yet another hit. Lease breach All these factors have pushed Southern Cross to the brink, but the key to its short-term future remains renegotiating its onerous rental payments. Only the 80 or so landlords themselves know whether a deal can be struck, although those with their own loans to service will not be in a position to accede. If a deal can be reached, there is a ""reasonable chance [Southern] can turn it around"", says Mr Laing. If they don't, then Southern will be in clear breach of its lease covenants, and the most likely outcome will be that the operator will be forced out. This does not mean, however, that the residents will follow suit. ""The principal factor that all stakeholders agree on is the delivery of care,"" says Jeremy Tasker, head of healthcare at Colliers International, a company that helps care home operators and landlords negotiate leases. He says there is no way residents will be forcibly moved, but rather a new operator will simply take over the lease. 'Tough times' Nor should residents at other care homes be concerned about a similar fate befalling them. The vast majority of homes, local authority cuts aside, have not had to contend with high rents, because they own the freeholds of their properties. In fact, some care operators such as Care UK and Primary Health Properties have prospered. With the benefit of hindsight, Southern's ""unique"" business model does not seem like such a smart move. As Mr Dixon says: ""You have to own the bricks and mortar when times are tough."" The decision to sell them off could yet be Southern's undoing.",Southern Cross is teetering on the brink of financial collapse due to an almost unique confluence of factors that has forced the company into desperate measures.
"Employees in the Unite trade union are disputing a below-inflation pay rise of 1%, which has been imposed. About 20 union members, including cleaners, security and maintenance staff, are picketing the Bank's headquarters in the City of London. Some are wearing facemasks of the Bank's governor, Mark Carney. They have been joined by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Staff in the Bank's ""parlours"", which are meeting rooms on the ground floor of the Bank's building in Threadneedle Street, have also walked out. It is the first time for more than 50 years that workers at the central bank have been on strike. ""The union balloted approximately 2% of the workforce,"" the Bank said, as only 150 staff work in the three affected departments. ""The Bank has plans in place so that all essential business will continue to operate as normal during this period. ""The Bank has been in talks with Unite up to and including today and remains ready to continue those talks at any time,"" it added. The last time Bank of England staff went on strike was in the late 60s and involved printers at the Bank's printing plant in Debden, who were employed by the Bank of England at that time. Unite said the dispute centred on the ""derisory"" pay settlement that the bank had imposed on staff without the union's agreement. It was the second year running that staff had received a below inflation pay offer, it said. Unite's London and Eastern regional secretary, Peter Kavanagh, said its members had ""been left with no choice but to take industrial action"". ""Mark Carney should come to the picket lines outside this iconic British bank today and explain why hardworking men and women deserve to face years of pay cuts."" ""They are struggling to pay their bills and feed their families because the bank has unjustly imposed a below inflation or zero pay rise,"" he added. Inflation was 2.6% last month, according to official figures.","A three-day strike by some Bank of England support staff has begun, after talks at the conciliation service Acas ended without agreement."
"By Adrian GoldbergPresenter, 5 live Investigates The UK European Consumer Centre (UK ECC) received nearly 100 complaints in the first five months of this year, significantly higher than the same period in 2009. The reports range from being wrongly charged for mysterious bumps and scratches, petrol and even missing seats. The car hire industry says these complaints represent ""a very small proportion of the 55 to 60 million rental transactions that take place annually"" across the EU. However as the UK ECC is not very well known, it believes that the number of complaints it receives represents only a small minority of cases. Credit card charge John Griffiths from Poole in Dorset hired a car last year whilst on holiday in Ireland. A couple of weeks after he returned home he received a letter from the car hire firm informing him that the sum of 450 euro had been charged to his credit card for damage to the rear bumper of his hire car. The damage had been identified in the pre-rental inspection so John Griffiths immediately contacted the company to dispute the charge. ""I was absolutely astounded and in fact very angry. I think it's incredible that they have the right to take money from my credit card without my authorisation."" As is common in many of these cases, John had an early flight so when he dropped off the car the rental office was shut and there was no member of staff to inspect the car. His money was eventually refunded following the intervention of the UK ECC but many holiday-makers are not so lucky. Tip of the iceberg Jed Mayatt, manager of the UK European Consumer Centre said: ""We knew that complaints about car hire were rising, but when we analysed our database I was really shocked at the scale of the problem."" Based on historical trends, the UKECC expects the number of disputes to rise to 400 by the end of the year. Complaints to the UKECC are believed to be the tip of the iceberg with many disputes going unreported. The majority of its cases relate to car hire problems in Spain, Italy, France and Ireland. Customers reported a range of hidden charges, including the cost of refuelling when the car had been returned with a full tank of petrol, extra insurance premiums and some holiday-makers paid for cars online yet on collection discovered their booking does not exist. Jed Mayatt from UKECC commented: ""Of course, not all car hires end in tears, but consumers really do need to wise up and take some basic precautions when they are entering into car rental contracts in the EU. ""Consumers are often at their most vulnerable during tough economic times and, quite naturally, they often have their guard down and are more trusting when they are on holiday"". ""Our general advice to consumers hiring cars abroad is, where possible, to return the car to someone in the office, get them to check the car and sign it off as in good condition. If you have to leave the car, take some photos - showing that it was returned in good condition."" In a statement Leaseurope - which represents car rental companies across the EU - told 5 live Investigates that the number of complaints represented a ""very small proportion of the 55 to 60 million rental transactions that take place annually"". Leaseurope says its members are ""working with the European Commission and consumer centres across Europe to further enhance the industry's handling of complaints"". ""We are currently piloting a European car rental conciliation service to handle this type of issue.""

"By Emily YoungBBC News I'm not sure Mumsnet would be the first place I would think of to advertise for a spy, but it's part of a new strategy by UK intelligence agencies - MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - to try to broaden their appeal to women. Some Mumsnet users joked they would be perfectly suited, since they, as middle-aged women, were so used to being invisible. Others were less sure. ShatnersBassoon wrote: ""Yes, people who can't help but type their every passing thought into an online forum would make great spies"" while iseenodust said: ""I have experience in sitting in cafes and love people watching."" But the agencies believe more women should be encouraged to apply not just for legal or ethical reasons, but because it will make the country safer. As the film industry chatters about the possibility of a female James Bond (Rolling Stone has even mocked up a Jane Bond trailer starring Emilia Clarke), the government is busy looking for a real-life one. But - male or female - what qualities do you need to make it as a spy? 'Ethically flexible' Former MI5 officer Annie Machon says it depends a lot on which of the government agencies you apply for. There are three: At MI5 - or ""the Box"" as it is known inside government - you run the operation, says Machon. You need to be a team leader, you need to be able to influence people easily and you need to be able to gain people's trust. For MI6, it's much more about the ability to operate abroad and alone, often in hostile environments, and perhaps be more ""ethically flexible"". And GCHQ staff tend to be the ""boffins"" - the types that are technically brilliant at things like coding and encryption, but perhaps not brilliant at a party, says Machon. The centre has been known to target internet hacker circles. Machon resigned with her former partner, David Shayler, as part of a whistle-blowing operation in 1996. They wanted to highlight what they felt was incompetent and criminal behaviour at the agencies. Shayler was sentenced to six months in prison for breaking the Official Secrets Act after leaking secret documents to the press. James Bond? But of her recruitment, she says: ""I applied for a job at the Foreign Office and got a letter saying we might have something more interesting for you."" She guessed it might be for the secret service. ""It's a really tough recruitment process. The first interview is about three hours long, covering your life since you were 12. Then there's a two-day course competing against other candidates - you have to analyse written data and role play around the case."" She adds that these are followed by very intense interviews, including with a psychiatrist, so you really need to be able to keep your cool. But if you fancy yourself as James Bond, you're unlikely to get in. ""Those types are weeded out early,"" she says. Prof Anthony Glees, who studies the world of intelligence and teaches at the University of Buckingham, seconds that. He says the key qualities needed are ""clarity, firmness, toughness and the ability to read and understand a file without jumping to conclusions"". And it's not all about chasing baddies, there are less glamorous aspects to the work as well. ""You need to be good at collecting data, analysing data and presenting data. You've also got to be good at acting on it,"" Prof Glees says. And, he reckons, modern-day spooks are generally very concerned about lawfulness and moral duty. Don't lie So is there anything that would stop you being employed? ""If you lied during your interview process,"" says Machon. It seems that it doesn't really matter if you broke the law, or dabbled in drugs, as long as there was nothing that you could be blackmailed with. Historically, it's been a man's world. When the intelligence agencies were set up, in the early 20th Century, recruits came from the military. And then, Prof Glees says, in World War 2, it was decided that the intelligence services needed to be intelligent. That was when tapping up the brightest students from universities began - and of course at that time it was mostly men. But it's changed since then. A recent government report on the issue says that last year 41.6% of MI5's workforce was female, with a target of 45% by 2021. Machon says that in her time there, in the early 1990s, it was 51% women and 49% men. She wonders whether the TV series Spooks, which ran from 2002 to 2011, may have deterred women from applying because it showed MI5 officers' work as so dangerous, much more so than the reality. To work at MI5... All three agencies say they have taken steps to promote flexible working. But logistically it is hard if you have to pick up the kids. If your operation ""goes live"" you need to be available 24 hours a day. Admittedly that might happen only a couple of times a year but the nature of it means that it's impossible to predict when. In some cases, there might be advantages to being a woman. Prof Glees says that one of the biggest problems facing MI5 now is working out why so many women are joining so-called Islamic State. You could argue that a woman might be better suited to gaining the confidence of a female informer, for example. Social media has changed things, with online profiles often providing details about someone's political leanings or if they have a partner - information that previously would have required a lot of man-hours to gather. For security reasons, intelligence officers are required to have a low social media presence - as are their partners (as one former head of MI6 found to his embarrassment). But perhaps the most important quality of all is a certain drive to want to protect your country and make it a better place. Annie Machon says she and her colleagues liked the idea of making a difference. So for those of you who think you've got what it takes, there's an MI5 quiz to get you started. Just don't mention it on Facebook.","Wanted: Tough, intelligent, patriotic person who can keep national secrets."
"The former state-owned phone giant has dropped PwC and will replace them with rival accounting firm KPMG. In January, BT admitted its Italian business had overstated profits, leading to a share price slump. KPMG was called on at the time to investigate what it described as ""inappropriate behaviour"" by managers. Now the firm will be able to get to grips with the accounts more fully once the 2017-18 results are audited by PwC for the final time. BT said it wanted to ""ensure a smooth and effective migration"" and will want to put a line in the sand under a difficult year. Shares hit The scandal at BT Italia emerged after a whistleblower informed executives in 2016 of the problems. An subsequent investigation by KPMG found ""improper accounting practices and a complex set of improper sales, purchase, factoring and leasing transactions"", which meant profits in the Italian business had been overstated for a number of years. Last month, BT revealed that, as a result of the scandal, chief executive Gavin Patterson's pay would be cut from £5.28m to £1.34m. Around 4,000 staff were also axed, although some of these cuts were announced before the scale of the scandal was known. Shares slumped, wiping £8bn off BT's value and remain at four-year lows. New stock market rules have been introduced in an attempt to encourage companies to change their auditors more regularly. Businesses in the FTSE 350 must now put their auditing contract out to tender every 10 years, although they only need to change them every 20 years.

"Nissan's commitment to its Sunderland car plant, the UK's biggest, had been in doubt following the EU referendum. But after government pledges, Nissan is to build two key models in the UK. ""We have seen the press reports regarding Nissan and as a result the Commission... is in contact with the UK authorities,"" a spokesman said. UK Business Secretary Greg Clark has said Nissan was told that the government would seek tariff-free access to EU markets for the car industry. However, the agreement has raised fears that the government might have breached EU rules preventing unfair state aid to companies. The Commission spokesman said: ""The UK authorities have not notified any support to Nissan for assessment under our state aid rules and we've therefore not taken any formal view of this matter."" Depending on the terms of the UK's exit from the EU, Britain may well no longer be bound by EU state aid rules following Brexit. But as long as it remains a member, the UK would not be able to favour particular companies. Mr Clark has insisted that that there was ""no cheque book"" involved in the assurances given to Nissan.","The European Commission says it is in contact with UK authorities after Japan's Nissan said it had been given ""support and assurances"" over Brexit."
"Owner BMW said its summer maintenance shutdown had been brought forward to 1 April to reduce any ""possible short-term parts-supply disruption"". ""While we believe this worst case scenario is an unlikely outcome, we have to plan for it,"" BMW said. The German firm said it ""remained committed"" to its UK operations. The Cowley plant, on the outskirts of Oxford, will remain open in April with maintenance, management and catering staff continuing to work despite no cars being made. It employs 4,500 people and produces 5,000 cars a week. BMW said the downtime would be used to start preparing the plant to make the new electric Mini. Global operation The concern is that in the event of the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the borders and shortages of parts. Hundreds of lorries a day arrive at Cowley with parts from across the world, with 60% of components coming from the EU. Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent Factory shutdowns are common in the car industry. Machinery needs to be repaired or replaced and updates or modifications to production lines carried out. Usually at Mini this happens during the summer and is built into the carmaker's output planning. What BMW has done is simply reschedule that shutdown to coincide with a potential period of serious disruption at the borders after Brexit, if we leave the EU without a deal. If the plant is not actually making cars, then a shortage of imported parts should not be so much of a problem. The company says a no-deal outcome is unlikely, but has to be planned for. Rescheduling the annual shutdown looks like a relatively simple and inexpensive piece of contingency planning. Nevertheless, it does send out a political message. It's a reminder that carmakers are particularly reliant on frictionless borders, to ensure parts arrive where they're needed at exactly the right time. And it shows that BMW is taking the risk of a no-deal Brexit seriously. Add that to comments made by the Jaguar Land Rover boss last week suggesting that the wrong Brexit deal could cost tens of thousands of jobs, and it suggests that people within the industry are getting rather nervous right now. Other carmakers with British operations have warned that a bad or no Brexit deal would be damaging for the UK car industry. Earlier on Tuesday, the head of Honda Europe, Ian Howells, told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. ""In terms of administration, we'd probably be looking at something like sixty odd thousand additional bits of documentation we would have to provide to get product to and from Europe,"" Mr Howells told BBC Radio 5 live. ""And clearly if we end up with World Trade Organization tariffs we'd have something like 10% costs in addition on our shipped product back into Europe, and that would certainly run into tens of millions of pounds."" Last week, Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralf Speth warned the government to get ""the right Brexit"" or it could wipe out profits at the carmaker and lead to big job cuts. On Tuesday the company said about 1,000 workers at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham would move from a five-day to a three-day week from October until Christmas. JLR - the UK's largest carmaker - said it was making ""temporary adjustments"" to its production schedules at the factory, which produces Jaguar cars.",The Mini factory in Oxford will shut down for a month after Brexit at the end of March to minimise disruption in case of a no-deal outcome.
"Assembly Bill 5, as its known, will affect firms like Uber and Lyft, which are based in California and depend on those working in the gig economy. Some estimates suggest costs for those firms would increase by 30% if they have to treat workers as employees. But opponents of the bill say it will hurt those people who want to work flexible hours. The rise of the gig economy, where people accept work on a per job basis, has spawned a swathe of mobile apps, normally putting people in touch directly with drivers or riders. But fears that tech firms like Uber or DoorDash, a food delivery company, are exploiting their scale to erode workers' rights have caused lawmakers to look at how to protect those workers. In California, Assembly Bill 5 would put into law a judgement from the state's supreme court last year that created a new test for whether a worker should be considered an employee. Employee status can entitle them to benefits like health care, minimum wage and paid time off. That would change the nature of the gig-economy, which has been a cornerstone of the model adopted by a raft of valuable new companies. But California state senator Maria Elena Durazo said underpaying workers wasn't innovative. It's not just tech firms in California that are worried about the proposed change in law. Contracting work has taken hold in many industries and California has often led the way in introducing legislation that is adopted elsewhere in the US. ""People ought to be very concerned because what happens here does tend to get copied in other states,"" Joseph Rajkovacz, director of governmental affairs for the Western States Trucking Association, which represents truck drivers, many of whom are temporary and freelance workers, told Reuters. It's still not clear how the bill will be implemented. US Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris have all come out in support of the bill, which is backed by California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose signature is required to turn it into law. But on Tuesday, Mr Newsom told the Wall Street Journal that he planned to continue negotiating with companies hoping to be exempted from the bill. Uber and Lyft have both proposed a referendum on the decision and put $90m aside to lobby for that. In a statement after the bill was passed, Lyft said: ""We are fully prepared to take this issue to the voters of California to preserve the freedom and access drivers and riders want and need."" In the UK, Uber lost its bid to convince the Court of Appeal that its workers weren't staff. It asked the court to overturn an employment tribunal decision that Uber drivers be treated as workers rather than self-employed. The tribunal ruled that two drivers were staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. The business models of gig economy companies are already under strain - Uber lost more than $5bn in the last quarter alone. Some estimates suggest that having to treat workers as employees, rather than independent contractors, could increase costs by as much as 30%. Uber and rival ridesharing service Lyft joined forces to push back again the bill. They suggested a guaranteed minimum wage of $21 per hour instead of the sweeping changes the bill would bring. But that pledge wasn't enough to sway California's Senate, and the state's governor Gavin Newsom is expected to soon sign the bill into law. That paves the way for California's 1 million gig workers to gain added rights next year.",California lawmakers have passed a bill that paves the way for gig economy workers to get holiday and sick pay.
"Profits at Bank of America were $4.35bn (£3.44bn), up 44% from the same period in 2016, with gains across its major divisions. Goldman Sachs profits rose 80% from a year earlier to $2.2bn. But the firm disappointed analysts with a decline in revenues from institutional investors. Shares in Goldman Sachs fell more than 3% after the market opened. Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said: ""The operating environment was mixed, with client activity challenged in certain market-making businesses and a more attractive backdrop for underwriting in our investment banking franchise."" Goldman said revenue in the January to March period was about $8bn. Investment banking revenue rose 16%, but its institutional client services unit - the largest division by revenue - declined 2% from the 2016 first quarter. Total costs at the bank increased by 15%, driven by higher pay. At Bank of America, gains in the global banking unit helped to boost profits in the January-to-March period. The division's net income was $1.7bn, rising 58% year-on-year due to record investment banking fees. Total revenue increased 7% to $22.2bn. ""The US economy continues to show consumer and business optimism, and our results reflect that,"" chief executive Brian Moynihan said. Bank of America, which serves some 46 million households, last year was hurt by losses related to property and the energy industry in the first quarter. Those have declined, but the firm said it saw an uptick in credit card losses from the end of 2016.","Two major US banks have reported increased profits for the first quarter of the year, amid higher interest rates and an energy sector rebound."
"Last year the group made £26.6m in the first half, and blamed heavy investment for this year's expected fall. It also announced it would change the names of its stores to John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners. The retailer said its Waitrose chain would close five of its 353 shops. It also has 50 John Lewis department stores. The name change to Waitrose & Partners and John Lewis & Partners was intended to emphasis the importance of the chain's 85,000 members of staff, known as ""partners"" who are given an annual bonus based on the chain's profits. The aim of the rebranding was to differentiate the group from other retailers, the company said. The rebranding will begin in September with London's Oxford Street store. Two Little Waitrose stores will close in Manchester, one in Birmingham and one in central London. It will also shut its supermarket in Camden in London. In a statement John Lewis said it was widely acknowledged that the retail sector was going through a period of ""generational change"". Its response would be to focus on ""greater differentiation - not scale"" and invest more in developing ""unique"" products and services, as well as placing more emphasis on its own brand. It said it would continue to invest between £400m and £500m per year in the business. Bonus cuts As well as warning it did not expect to make any profit in the first half of the year, it said there were a ""wide range of possible outcomes, for the full year, given the market uncertainty"". It said it was assuming that profits before exceptional items would be ""substantially lower"" than last year's £290m. While profits are expected to grow at Waitrose, the John Lewis department stores are expected to see profits decline this year. In March, John Lewis Partnership announced that bonuses had been cut for the fifth year in a row. Employees got a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since the 4% paid out in 1954. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the group was facing a ""cocktail of pressures"" on its profitability. Many retailers have come under pressure in recent months thanks to the growth of online shopping and lower footfall on High Streets, combined with rising costs and a fall in consumer confidence. Retail experts have said one solution is to offer ""experiences"" that shoppers cannot get online. For John Lewis, one example of that is personal shopping. The new John Lewis store in Shepherd's Bush in west London has a team of six personal shoppers to help customers select fashion items and outfits. Plumbing plans According to a spokeswoman, customers who used the service spent on average 30% more a year following their appointments, than people who had not used it. The six personal shoppers generated one fifth of the total womenswear sales in the store, she added. John Lewis also plans to build a presence in the home services market, offering plumbing and electrical work, as well as financial services. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""For us, the relentless pursuit of greater scale is not the right course. Our plans put differentiation, innovation and partner-led service at the heart of our offer."" However, the group added, the changes it was making relied on ""sustained investment"". It said it would raise £500m by over three years to invest in ""product and service innovation"". It said it would raise the funds by ""rebuilding profitability at Waitrose"", getting more out of its property, by putting space it does not need to other uses, and ""conducting a review of the partnership's pension scheme"" which has an accounting deficit of £731m. Sir Charlie told the BBC the pension fund would ""only change if partners want it to change, but... it's a £6bn pension fund so there may be opportunities for us to make small changes there that could add up to significant amounts of money over long periods of time"". Mr Lim of Retail Economics said John Lewis ""used to be the retailer that everyone looked at as being a success story on the High Street"". But this latest announcement suggests in the current climate it is becoming ""increasingly difficult for businesses to ride out structural change in the industry"", he added. ""If John Lewis is finding it difficult I'm sure a number of other retailers are in a similar situation.""","John Lewis Partnership, which owns John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, has warned that profits in the first half of the year will be ""close to zero""."
"Despite some high-profile reports of executive pay cuts, these were mainly ""superficial or short-term"", it says. Nor have firms addressed a culture of excessive bonuses, says the report by the CIPD, the professional body for HR, and the High Pay Centre think tank. It comes amid huge job cuts as the furlough scheme begins to unwind. Some 36 FTSE 100 firms had made pay cuts, according to analysis of company statements to the London Stock Exchange up to 3 July. ""The most common measure, taken by 14 companies, has been to cut salaries at the top by 20%,"" the report said. ""However, salaries typically only make up a small part of a FTSE 100 chief executive's total pay package."" The report said 11 firms had cancelled short-term incentive plans for their chief executives, while two other companies had deferred salary increases. However, none of the 36 had chosen to reduce their chief executive's long-term incentive plan, which generally makes up half of a chief executive's total pay package. No change ""It doesn't look like the pandemic has proven to be an inflection point for executive pay yet,"" said CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese. ""The bulk of cuts made so far appear to be short-term and don't signify meaningful, long-term change. ""Pay among the FTSE 100 will probably fall next year, but this is more likely to be due to wider economic circumstances, rather than a fundamental change in approach to executive pay. "" As well as examining pandemic-related measures, the CIPD and the High Pay Centre also issued their annual analysis of executive pay, this time covering the 2018-19 financial year. They found that in that year, a chief executive earned 119 times more than the average UK full-time worker. Typically, the boss took home £3.61m, while the average full-time worker in the UK earned £30,353. ""This is broadly the same as the median FTSE 100 chief executive salary for the financial year ending 2018 (£3.63m) and only represents a 0.5% decrease,"" the report said. Pay 'extravagance' High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said: ""Very high chief executive pay undermines the spirit of solidarity that many companies are trying to project as they battle against the impact of the coronavirus. ""More pragmatically, multi-million-pound pay awards worth over a hundred times the salary of a typical worker seems like an unnecessary extravagance during a period of such economic uncertainty. ""If we want to protect as many jobs as possible and give the lower-paid workers who have got the country through this crisis the pay rise they deserve, we will need to rethink the balance of pay between those at the top and everybody else.""","The UK's biggest listed companies have failed to address their bosses' huge salaries during the coronavirus pandemic, a pay report claims."
"The 24-hour walk-out involves staff in Germany, Sweden, Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands. About 50,000 passengers are understood to have been told of cancellations on 400 flights. The action is the largest in a series of strikes over pay and conditions. Ryanair says it has made every effort to resolve the dispute. The company says 85% of its scheduled flights will operate as normal on Saturday and the majority of customers affected have been given places on other Ryanair flights. The Irish airline, Europe's largest low-cost carrier, averted widespread strikes before Christmas by agreeing to recognise unions for the first time in its 30-year history. But there have been protests ever since over the negotiating of collective labour agreements. About 300 Ryanair flights were cancelled in July when cabin crews in Belgium, Portugal and Spain went on strike for 48 hours. 'I'm going to miss my best friend's wedding' Emily Dutton was due to fly to Gothenburg in Sweden for a wedding, with her boyfriend Craig. But the ""once in a lifetime experience"" of being at her best friend Justine's wedding seems impossible now, after Ryanair cancelled her flight with two days' notice. The 27-year-old project manager from Letchworth was due to fly from Stansted Airport, and was told there were no alternative flights for the rest of the day. ""The only reason I found this out was through a reminder email about checking in being sent to my email account. ""Had I not checked, I would have arrived at the airport only to find my flight being cancelled. ""I spent about four hours [yesterday] calling them and trying to find my own travel options to see how to get to Sweden. ""They couldn't find us any alternative flights until Sunday. Great news, the wedding is on Saturday so that was absolutely no use."" She tried to find any other flights to Sweden from other UK airports, and even asked if she could fly to Copenhagen in Denmark, and get a train to Gothenburg instead. ""My only options were to get a refund or to go down the route - which I have done - to claim compensation."" The airline in recent days announced the cancellations of 250 flights in and out Germany, 104 to and from Belgium and another 42 affecting Sweden and Ireland. A Dutch court on Thursday evening rejected a case from Ryanair seeking to block pilots in the Netherlands from joining the strike, affecting about 22 flights. But at about the same time Ryanair issued a statement saying there would be no cancellations. The unions want the contracts of Ryanair employees to be governed by the laws of the nation where they are based, not by Irish legislation. Ryanair has described the strike action as ""regrettable and unjustified"", claiming its pilots are paid more than other budget airlines. It said it has taken every step to minimise the disruption, adding: ""The majority of customers affected have already been re-accommodated on another Ryanair flight."" The airline has maintained that strikes qualify as ""extraordinary circumstances"" and are therefore exempt from EU compensation rules. But the Civil Aviation Authority says that, in the case of strikes by an airline's employees, the airline is responsible for compensation. Consumer group Which? said affected passengers should lodge a claim with the airline. Which? travel editor Rory Boland said the dispute resolution service used by Ryanair had already confirmed it would uphold a previous European ruling that crew strikes are not usually considered ""extraordinary circumstances"".","Ryanair pilots are striking in five European countries, forcing the cancellation of a sixth of the firm's flights during the holiday season peak."
"By Suzanne BearneBusiness reporter It is, though, popular among photographers and magazine editors, who love the retro appearance - and the indoor swimming. Ms Milner is one of a growing number of people hiring their homes for film and photography shoots. It is not without its hassle and disruption, but the money can be good. She hires her house in Streatham, south London, for up to £500 per day, although some homes can be rented for far more. ""We hired it out from the moment we moved in,"" says Ms Milner, 47, who has lived at the property with her family for 13 years. ""The guy who lived in it before had set it up as a shoot location and we basically took over from that."" Working in the advertising industry, Ms Milner knew that running a location house could prove to be a lucrative business. ""I've been to lots of different houses for magazine shoots. I knew that if you had an interesting space, you're likely to get shoots."" Her home is hired out about four times a month for shoots ranging from brand campaigns to magazine editorials. She rents her house through Location Works, an agency with more than 4,000 properties on its books that can be used for location filming and photography. The firm's managing director, Lorna Gatherer-Ford, says: ""There does seem to be a trend, particularly in London, of people buying normal houses and decorating them with shoots in mind. ""For example, people would superficially put in a gas hob in the island of the kitchen so they could be used for cookery shows."" Day rates tend to start from £350 for a small crew and go up to £3,000 for a major feature film. Agencies such as Location Works take a cut of the fees, ranging between 15% to 25%. ""It can be a great earner for people, although like anything else in the creative industry, you never know what the trend might be,"" says Ms Gatherer-Ford. ""Some properties are used all the time, and other places now and again."" Properties featuring bare brick walls, bright colours, or the distressed style are currently in vogue, she says. ""But at the other end, white and modern are popular too."" The opportunity to earn some extra cash is encouraging others to dress up their homes with a little creative magic. After seeing a friend enjoy success with her property, Amy Exton, 29, bought a two-bedroom house in Margate a year ago in order to create her dream, fantasy home, aptly named Margate Location House. The freelance set designer opened her property up for shoots two months ago, and rates start from £500 a day. So far, a handful of fashion stylists and vintage brands have taken advantage of the vibrant and colourful three-floor townhouse, which features a vintage pink bathroom suite with gold fittings and red walls, and pink walls and outlandish sofas in the lounge, and a mural in the outside courtyard. ""Being a set designer, it's basically like creating a set,"" says Ms Exton. ""I'm really into interior design and wanted to move into that direction."" She says she spent £20,000 on revamping the place from its magnolia décor and injecting bright, colourful hues. ""Given that it's outside of London, I needed to offer something different,"" she says. Like many location-house owners, she's promoting her property through a combination of ways including her own website, a dedicated Instagram account. She plans to join agencies such as Location Works, which draw up contracts between the filmmakers and property owners. However, prospective location homeowners need to tread carefully, and check if there are any rules and regulations in place which may hinder hiring out their house for shoots. Ms Milner says her property can only host 52 shoots per year after a neighbour filed a complaint with the council. ""We have worked really hard to make it work so we don't allow crews to park on our little road, for instance. We don't do film shoots anymore. It's about respecting our neighbours, so we are very considerate,"" she says.

'I turned my dad's erotic novel into a hit podcast' If it is a big film shoot, some homeowners may have to let the crew re-arrange furniture. Things can get damaged, although it would be paid for. Occupants may even have to move out, although hotel costs would also be covered. Frances Woodhouse, 57, who has hired out her Cheshire home for more than eight years through UK Locations, warns that it's not for the fainthearted. ""It depends on what kind of shoot it is, but some of them, especially in the past few years as budgets have been cut, try and use as much as the house as possible. It can be extremely disruptive. I don't think people are aware of how disruptive is it,"" she says. Despite this, she does get a thrill out of hiring out her Cheshire home, which has been used for everything from celebrity magazine shoots to dog food adverts. ""I've generally had good experiences as I've worked with a reputable company, and I'm easy-going and flexible."" Ms Woodhouse says the upsides easily outweigh the negatives. ""I quite enjoy seeing how young people work in the industry, and seeing the advances in cameras and computers. Plus, it's an empty house as the children have left, so it's nice to use the space before we downsize."" Ms Milner also agrees that opening up her property isn't just about the money, and that she has met some very interesting people. ""I also think it's been good for my children to live in a creative house,"" she says. She also loves the buzz of seeing her house featured in magazines and adverts.

"Liane Hornsey was head of Uber's human resources department, with the title of chief people officer. She had been in the role for 18 months. Her departure comes just a year after the firm's founder, Travis Kalanick, left under a cloud following reports of gender discrimination and harassment. Since then, new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi has focused on turning around the company's reputation and overhauling what some said had become a toxic corporate culture. The departure of Ms Hornsey, who previously worked for Google, represents another setback for the firm. Uber has also had to wrestle with licensing problems in major cities, including London, and has had to call a temporary halt to its driverless car programme following a fatality. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America business reporter At ""new"" Uber, in the post-Travis Kalanick age, they're taking no chances. As head of HR, Liane Hornsey had survived Uber's well-publicised troubles, despite being at the helm of a firm with some famously deep-rooted people problems. But now, time is apparently up. Officially the company isn't going into the details - but a source at the company confirmed to me the details in Reuters' report: that an investigation into how Ms Hornsey handled racial discrimination complaints was the reason she had to leave. Liane Hornsey came to the company with quite a reputation. The former Googler was seen as a major coup, one of the most well-regarded names in tech industry HR. And Uber really needed her help - it was growing rapidly. It will now need to move on without her. Anonymous whistleblowers at Uber have claimed Ms Hornsey systematically dismissed internal complaints of racial discrimination. They said reports to the firm's internal anonymous tip line were often left unresolved or dismissed, especially if they dealt with issues of race. Unnamed employees also said Ms Hornsey had used discriminatory language and made derogatory comments about two fellow Uber executives. Law firm Gibson Dunn carried out an investigation which substantiated some of the allegations made. A second investigation is expected. Mr Khosrowshahi praised Ms Hornsey in an email to employees as ""incredibly talented, creative and hard-working"". Neither he nor Ms Hornsey gave any reason for her departure. Ms Hornsey, in a separate email to employees, said she realised her exit ""comes a little out of the blue for some of you, but I have been thinking about this for a while"". Uber said the set of complaints over racial discrimination had been properly dealt with. ""We are confident that the investigation was conducted in an unbiased, thorough and credible manner, and that the conclusions of the investigation were addressed appropriately,"" it said.","A senior executive at the ride-hailing firm Uber has resigned, following an investigation into how she handled allegations of racial discrimination at the firm."
"By Nicola K SmithTechnology of Business reporter Would watching a cartoon version of yourself leaping over aeroplanes and buildings, and encountering dancing pandas on a huge screen, convince you to buy a new sports shoe? Sports clothing giant Nike thinks so. It developed a way of inserting lookalike digital versions of customers into a virtual environment called Reactland. Customers run on a treadmill wearing the firm's new React shoe while watching themselves in the game. Launched in Shanghai, China, last year, Nike has rolled out the experience in stores globally, with more installations planned for this year, including in Taiwan, Berlin and Dubai. ""The key element, from a consumer perspective, was to create deep personalisation by building game avatars that look just like the player,"" says Yifei Chai, creative director at Unit9, one of the creative agencies involved in the project. ""From a brand point of view, the game helps players understand the uniqueness of the Nike React shoe in a suitably playful and memorable way."" This is what's known as ""experiential"" marketing - making shopping more interactive and entertaining. ""At the heart of retail's ongoing transformation is a shift in focus from the point of sale to the point of experience,"" says Scott Clarke, chief digital officer at tech consultancy Cognizant. ""Immersive retail experiences are still one of the few realities that retailers can perform better than Amazon."" Augmented reality (AR) - overlaying digital imagery onto the real world - is a key technology in this trend. Last year, Adidas launched its X18 football boot to tie in with the Fifa World Cup. Working with design consultancy Fitch, Adidas created an experiential campaign in 70 retail stores in 22 countries. Shoppers could point an iPad at an image then ""view product videos and explore the boot's technical specifications, which helped them understand the product better and make their final purchase choice easier,"" explains Des Tapaki, digital director at Fitch. ""We found that once they started the activation, a very large number of consumers were immersed in the experience and interacted with all pieces of content."" AR is also valuable in helping retailers showcase their growing product catalogues in-store, and is even being used in supermarkets to help encourage healthy eating. Take Biedronka, for example, Poland's largest discount supermarket chain. In 2017, the retailer introduced floor stickers throughout the store that could be scanned by a smartphone to unlock a group of virtual vegetable characters called the ''Goodness Gang''. ""A core objective was to liven up shopping and promote healthy eating and choices,"" says Malcolm Fogarty, global digital and innovation director at TCC Global, the retail marketing specialist that helped Biedronka with the project. ""AR was the perfect way to achieve both of these goals. Finding the AR codes brings an element of a treasure hunt to the weekly shop, but the placement of the codes ensures shoppers are driven to the categories that are most relevant to the campaign. ""In this case, that's fruit and vegetables."" The Goodness Gang AR app has been downloaded 1.5 million times to date after being launched with several major European retailers, including Lidl Ireland and the UK's Co-Operative Group. Sales at the retailers they have worked with have increased 3%-to-5% over the campaign periods, says Mr Fogarty. And this is the main point. In-store games and experiences are not just about keeping shoppers coming through the doors rather than ordering online, it's about selling more product. Barclaycard research from October 2017 found that retailers who hosted events and provided entertainment in physical stores could boost their annual turnover by an average of 14%. Tech-based experiential marketing also presents opportunities for retailers to capture today's golden currency - customer data. For example, Nike's in-store Trial Zone Basketball areas give consumers the chance to test shoes while doing practice moves as cameras capture their moves. Staff - or ""in-store athletes"" - monitor the performance and advise on the best shoe. More Technology of Business ""Performance data is collected via digital displays and sensors around the stores that customers can later access via the Nike Plus app or online too,"" says Laura Wynch, co-founder of retail technology consultancy, Validify. ""As well as creating an immersive experience, and bridging the online with the offline, they are collating huge amounts of data to deliver up individual product recommendations and advice to their customers."" Trying on clothes in cramped, harshly lit changing rooms can be a stressful business. So fashion retailer, Rebecca Minkoff, has introduced interactive mirrors in the changing rooms of its flagship New York store. Customers can order items in a different size or colour and change lighting schemes and backgrounds with just a few taps of the glass. ""This removes significant friction for the customer as they don't need to go through the rigmarole of getting changed and having to try and find something else they like,"" says Martin Newman from ecommerce consultancy, Practicology. ""This has increased sales and conversion in-store by 30%."" Winter clothing retailer Canada Goose has gone a step further, installing small ""cold rooms"" in a number of its stores where customers can try on jackets surrounded by ice sculptures in temperatures as low as -25C. But could all these tech-based experiences become simply a gimmick? Validify's Laura Wynch warns: ""Technology isn't, and shouldn't, be seen as a silver bullet for retailers' problems. Retailers must first figure out who their customer is, what they value in their brand, and how can they deliver the best possible customer experience. ""The customer should drive tech adoption - not the other way around.""",Retailers are adopting a range of new technologies to help make the shopping experience more fun and interactive. But will this be enough to slow the High Street's demise and Amazon's remorseless advance?
"Its chief operating officer, Niall Wass, told Newsnight it had one million UK customers, of whom 99% were content with the company's lending terms. Wonga's interest rates are typically 1% a day, an interest rate that mounts up rapidly if the loan is extended. Such loans have faced criticism from many, including Church leaders. Wonga, and other payday loan providers, will appear in front of MPs on Tuesday. The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee is holding a one-off evidence session on the regulation of such companies. Their business practices are already being looked at by a range of top regulators, including the Office of Fair Trading, the Competition Committee and the Financial Conduct Authority. Mortgages One of the country's best-known mortgage commentators, Ray Boulger from the advisers John Charcol, told Newsnight that taking out a payday loan could adversely affect any future mortgage offer: ""Our experience is that mortgage lenders will often turn down requests for people who have had a payday loan - the regulator should require payday lenders to display this."" Mr Wass said he had not come across this problem, but he would look into the issue and report back to the Newsnight programme. One customer, Liz Matthews, told the BBC she started with a loan of £300 but now owed £2,000 and was having sleepless nights. Liz Matthews said she told the company she was employed in order to take out a loan, when, in fact, she was out of work. But Mr Wass told the BBC that Wonga was careful about who it lends to. He said his customers' views were not being properly represented by the media and others: ""The perception is that Wonga customers are poor and vulnerable but there are a silent majority of customers out there who are not."" The company released a feature film this week that carries stories from 12 customers, who are broadly positive about the service they received.",Payday loan provider Wonga has told the BBC its business practices are being misrepresented and the vast majority of its customers are happy.
"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter It said 54% of landlords had seen tenants on the benefit fall into arrears in the last year. Debt charity Turn2Us warned universal credit will lead to ""more rent arrears, more evictions and more homelessness"". But the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said landlords had reported seeing fewer claimants in arrears in the last year. Preventative action David Smith, policy director for the Residential Landlords Association (RLA), said it was taking too long for people struggling on universal credit to get the help they needed. ""The system only provides extra support once tenants are in rent arrears. Instead, more should be done to prevent tenants falling behind with their rent in the first place. ""Only then will landlords have the confidence they need that tenants being on universal credit does not pose a financial risk they are unable to shoulder."" He warned that without such changes, benefit claimants would struggle to find the homes to rent they need. Meanwhile, David Samson, welfare benefit specialist at Turn2Us, said the large number of people on universal credit in rent arrears was ""a devastating example of the crippling issues with the benefit"". ""The five week wait for universal credit married with the reality that it is just less generous than previous benefits will only conclude with more rent arrears, more evictions and more homelessness unless the government takes immediate action to fix some of the glaring problems."" 'They're terrified they're going to lose the benefit' Chris Town, who has been a landlord in Yorkshire for 31 years, says his tenants are ""all worried about universal credit; they're terrified they're going to lose the benefit"". He said introduction of the benefit since 2018 had caused many problems. ""You give people time to sort things out, but I'm waiting three months for arrears in some cases."" He said the problem was getting access to information. ""Up to now with housing benefit we've dealt with the local authority directly which means information was easy to access. ""Under universal credit it's not as accessible and you're not really sure what's going on."" Supporting renters Universal credit replaces six benefits, including housing benefit, and merges them into one payment. It's gradually being introduced but there are concerns that some claimants have seen their overall support cut. According to research from the RLA, 68% of landlords said there was a shortfall between the cost of rent and the amount paid in universal credit. The RLA has called on the government to do more to prevent rent arrears occurring in the first place including: ""The best way to help people pay their rent is to support them into work, and universal credit is helping people to get into work faster and stay in work longer than the old system,"" a DWP spokesperson said. ""We continue to work closely with landlords and tenants to make improvements to universal credit where necessary, including 100% advances available from day one of a claim.""","Universal credit is causing tenants to fall behind with rent, according to the Residential Landlords Association."
"By Harry KretchmerYou & Yours V5C log books record a car's ""registered keeper"". However, in some cases they are not being updated for several months after cars are sold, a BBC investigation has found. Some dealers retain the documents to help them qualify for large discounts from car manufacturers. The National Franchised Dealers Association describe the findings as ""concerning"" and say bonuses linked to sales might ""incentivise"" the activity. Small print The cars affected are ""pre-registered,"" excess stock sold cheaply by manufacturers to dealers. They must legally be kept off-road for 90 days before being re-sold. The delays can be even longer if the car was originally registered by a retailer as a business fleet vehicle. However, in some cases the cars are delivered to new buyers immediately, while the vehicles remain registered at a separate address, an investigation by BBC Radio 4's You and Yours has found. Many of the cars are sold on by online car brokers. They commonly disclose the disadvantages in their terms and conditions, explaining that the vehicles will be registered to customers ""in due course"". However, many customers fail to read the small print and some suffer the consequences. ""I couldn't drive the car because it had been declared off-road"", said buyer Andrew March. ""The car log book had been withheld so I couldn't re-tax it."" After asking repeatedly for his logbook, motorist James Laddie applied to the DVLA for a new one. The three-month delay proved expensive: ""The council would not transfer our old parking permit to the new car without proof of ownership. The combined cost of parking tickets was about £200."" Awkward position Experts stress that there can be potentially more serious consequences of a driver and their car being registered to different addresses. For example, police speed camera fines are sent to the postal address linked via DVLA records to a car's registration plate. One driver who spoke to You and Yours lived in London while his car remained registered for several months in Bolton. Insurance companies also require drivers to disclose both the owner and the registered keeper of a vehicle. Roy Rodger, an expert on insurance law who has trained underwriters, warns that drivers' confusion over withheld log books could lead to costly mistakes. ""In a situation where a driver misled the insurance company over registration details and a serious accident occurred, the driver could be in a very, very awkward position. ""They could have to pay the claim out of their own pocket eventually,"" he said. The Association of British Insurers told You and Yours it was not aware of any cases where this had happened, but added that drivers should inform motor insurers if they are not the registered keeper. Incentives The practice of log books being retained by third party suppliers was highlighted in a 2012 court case brought against a competitor by online car broker Richard Sanders, founder of Drive the Deal. The competitor had not adequately warned consumers of the risks involved. Although Mr Sanders won the case, he says the industry has not been fully cleaned up. ""We decided to start looking at this because we were very concerned indeed about the trouble that some consumers would get themselves into,"" he said. ""Unfortunately I think the practice of wrongly registering cars on purpose does continue."" The director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, says she is very concerned by the findings. ""As dealers are required to keep vehicles for 90 days to qualify for some bonuses, that could incentivise this type of activity,"" she said. Autocar editorial director, Jim Holder, says transparency in the car industry has improved but problems remain. ""This part of the industry is poorly regulated and there are still traders out there who ignore the rules,"" he said. ""It's not really a problem that the industry takes seriously and it's really only word of mouth and education that can stop this."" You and Yours is on BBC Radio 4 weekdays 12:15-13:00 GMT. Listen online or download the programme podcast.","Drivers of ""nearly new"" cars are being put at risk of invalid insurance and breaking the law because some motor traders are retaining log books."
"The work of Grameen Bank and others helped many families to raise their income above $1.25 a day, said the US-based Microcredit Summit Campaign. The study follows recent criticism of microfinance, which works by providing small loans to people to invest in generating their own incomes. Some experts argue the report may have missed the bigger picture. They say the success stories are comparatively few compared to the overall number of borrowers. 'Progress' The report drew on a survey of more than 4,000 households by the Economic Research Group in Dhaka. Alex Counts of Grameen Foundation said: ""This survey reminds us that even in difficult circumstances, major progress can be made."" Floods in 1998 and the food crisis of 2008 caused millions of families to fall below the $1.25 threshold. However, even with these setbacks, nearly 10 million people rose above the poverty level. But Dr Qazi Kholiquzzaman Ahmad, the chairman of PKSF which loans money to microcredit agencies in Bangladesh, says that his studies in 2006-2007 showed that only 7% of micro-borrowers were able to rise above the poverty line. ""Many borrowers remained where they were, while others suffered setbacks,"" he told BBC World Service's World Business News. ""In this latest study, only 10% of people have moved up, leaving the other 90% where they are. We cannot conclude that a whole lot has been achieved,"" he added. Conflicting data This news comes at a time when microfinance has come under close scrutiny over recent months. Serious charges emerged about microfinance borrowers taking on multiple loans and too much debt, coercive collection practices by microfinance staff, and even suicides among borrowers who were unable to meet their payments. India's multi-billion dollar industry was on the brink of a mass default until all the major banks in the country agreed to continue lending to microfinance firms. The evidence for microcredit lifting people out of poverty remains highly contested. ""Bangladesh is the capital of microcredit being used to tackle poverty,"" said Alun Doran at Oxfam, ""but the numerous studies about its effectiveness are conflicting."" He said there was a distinction between poverty alleviation and poverty reduction. Poverty alleviation involves mechanisms which can help people get out of poverty - and stay out. ""Secure savings are the preferred financial instrument rather than credit,"" Mr Doran maintained.","Microcredit lifted 10 million Bangladeshis out of poverty between 1990 and 2008, according to a report."
"Borrowing money from a peer-to-peer lender or changing currency with an online firm can be cheaper. But the lure of free bank accounts, and hidden risks associated with peer-to-peer are muddying the waters. And, for customers without debts, old-fashioned banks may come out on top. Meanwhile, these traditional banks also have an eye on the competition. Best return? Alternatives to bank loans come in the guise of peer-to-peer lenders, who connect lenders with borrowers directly. That means you can earn a better rate of interest, but there is no expensive pile of capital owned by bank share holders to bail you out if borrowers default. BBC research suggests that while borrowing from a peer-to-peer lender may cost less, who to deposit your cash with for the best return is less simple. A £2,000 peer-to-peer loan typically costs £7 to £27 a month compared with as much as £123 for a bank overdraft or £50 with a credit card. Free bank accounts while you are in credit, and the protection of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme, which guarantees deposits of up to £75,000, means comparing bank deposits with investing in peer-to-peer is tricky. While a 7% peer-to-peer interest rate clearly trumps the 1.5%-or-so top bank rate, you don't have deposit protection and may be constrained on when you can withdraw your money. Warren Mead, a financial technology analyst at KPMG, said banks still have big customer bases and ""despite everything, a degree of customer trust in banking"". 'Inefficient' banks Meanwhile, banks are setting up their own funds to invest in smaller peer-to-peer competitors. They are also trying to develop their own financial technology, or ""fintech"". But they are at a disadvantage compared to the newer entrants. ""Retail banking is relatively inefficient"" because of old computer systems dating in some cases back to the 1970s, said Mr Mead. They are spending billions of pounds to try and right this through mobile applications for phones and tablets, but still rely on elderly computer ""plumbing"". 'EBay model' The newer firms have a lot to offer, they say. Giles Andrews, founder of Zopa, a peer-to-peer lender, says his business model relies on efficiency to be cheaper. ""Customers know where their money is going"" and it goes to ""lots and lots of people"" to spread risk, he says. His business gathers data about borrowers to price the loans, he says. ""We were inspired by what eBay had done to retail,"" he says. ""We thought well, that was a really interesting inspiration, let's see if we can apply similar technology to the world of lending and borrowing."" But comparing them with a bank directly is hard. They don't have as much capital as traditional banks, he says. Regulators don't require it. ""Banks are regulated to take deposits and protect their depositors and hold a lot of regulatory capital to do so. Because we connect our lenders and borrowers directly"" that capital isn't required by regulators, he says. He identifies a way banks can muscle in, however. Big banks may well partner with smaller challengers similar to his, although many will stay independent, he adds. The challengers will also struggle so long as there is free banking - current accounts with no regular, or transparent, fees. Prototypes for business Taavet Hinrikus, of transfer service Transferwise, says ""keeping your balance is something where banks are in the best position to do"", but on everything else, they are being challenged. The BBC found changing currencies with a newer online firm was less than half the price of an average bank transaction. And there are opportunities for firms like his to grow. Only about a third of consumers have used non-banks for financial services, he says. But traditional banks are fighting back in more ways than one. As well as buying up the competition and offering guarantees, they are trying to win over customers by helping them with their businesses in less traditional ways. Barclays, for instance, is using vacant space above branches to offer its customers work space and coding lessons. People can come in and get business advice. Jon Paterson runs a 3-D printing service, which prototypes design ideas at a bank branch in Brighton. ""We are cutting down on time spent sending things to China, sending to overseas,"" he says. The facilities are open to everyone, with the bank offering free trials on Fridays to lure in new customers. But it is in the bank's interests to have successful businesses with a need for financing and burgeoning deposits under its roof. It is also an attempt to put banks back at the heart of economic growth, says the lender.","New lenders may struggle to prise customers from traditional banks even though their borrowing and lending rates can often be much better, research from the BBC suggests."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance Reporter, BBC News But when Benny and the band reflected on the passing memories and the tears, they forgot to mention the practical dilemmas faced by separating couples: how to divide the money, and what to do about the children. And in the last six months sorting out those issues has got even harder. Dozens of centres designed to help couples split up amicably are in danger of closure. Indeed some are already in the process of shutting their doors. The closures are an unintended consequence of cuts to the legal aid system, which the government introduced in April. Since then mediators have seen far fewer couples coming through their doors. In May last year 2,800 couples attended sessions, according to the government. By May this year that had more than halved to 1,200. 'Hidden service' For most people, mediation is a much less stressful process than going to court. It is also cheaper. The mediator will take it for granted that the couple is splitting up, so his or her job is simply to help divide the financial assets, and arrange access to the children. Lawyers are not involved. ""It gets sorted a lot quicker. You both still have your say. And there are no arguments,"" says 23 year-old Sinead Harris from Guildford in Surrey. She spilt from her partner earlier this year, and needed help with arranging access to her two year-old son. ""Going through the courts would have meant more stress and more arguments,"" she says, ""which is not good for a child to be around."" So why are fewer people using the service? Since April, most couples no longer qualify for legal aid for divorce or separation. When they did receive legal aid, lawyers would often refer them on to mediators. Now that process no longer happens. ""Because there's no legal aid, people don't look at mediation,"" says Eileen Pereira, of National Family Mediation. ""Ours has become a hidden service,"" she adds. 'Hiccup' Eight mediation services, including some based in Sussex, Wiltshire, Hertfordshire and Lancashire, have already announced their intention to close. Eileen Pereira believes three or four times that number are also under threat. If the closures continue she worries that many more families will be forced to use lawyers instead. ""That means they will be spending more,"" she says. ""But also the emotional impact on the family will be much greater because the families will not be supported through this process."" The government, which had hoped the legal aid changes might actually encourage more people to use mediation, has been taken by surprise by the fall-off in demand. Lord McNally, the Families Justice Minister, admitted that it was a ""hiccup"". ""We've noticed the dip,"" he told the BBC. ""We're looking at how we can address the issue, and hope to help them promote more mediation more vigorously in the future,"" he said. But in the meantime much of the £25m set aside as legal aid for mediation has remained unspent. Advice From April 2014, a new law will require those separating in the courts to at least have tried mediation. The government believes that will re-invigorate demand for the services. National Family Mediation, which represents mediation services around the country, cannot be certain how many services will still be in existence by then. In the meantime the government is doing its best to encourage people to go ahead and find a mediator themselves, without being referred by a lawyer. Couples can go via a Ministry of Justice website to locate a mediator based near them, or via National Family Mediation. Those interested are also being reminded that in many cases legal aid is available. Anyone with income below £31,884 might be eligible, depending on some property-owning criteria as well. In addition the government has produced a video, to give people further advice. When they sang, Knowing me, knowing you, Abba also suggested, ""There is nothing we can do."" However, that is a sentiment that advocates of mediation might well challenge. Even though some break-ups are inevitable, there are ways in which the practicalities, and the costs, of separation can be made more tolerable.","As Abba once sang so wistfully, breaking up is never easy."
"By Anna MeiselRadio 4 Money Box The firms, which operate at the fringes of the law, target key workers drafted in to help with the coronavirus crisis, a BBC Money Box investigation found. Social media adverts push workers toward some umbrella companies that take a hefty cut of their salaries. In return, these companies hide a portion of their pay from the taxman. But Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has said signing up with these firms, which it described as ""unscrupulous"", could leave key workers facing large, unexpected tax bills. One advert on Twitter says: ""If you've been drafted in to reinforce the NHS response to the #coronavirus pandemic, we want to assist you."" When operating legitimately, working through an umbrella company can make it easier to take on jobs for multiple employers at once. The worker has their salary paid to the umbrella company, which then pays tax, National Insurance and other deductions on their behalf. After taking a fee, the umbrella company will then pay the worker what is left. But one company told Money Box that it was possible to save thousands of pounds a year legally by hiding a large chunk of a worker's salary from the taxman. Posing as a healthcare worker on a salary of £145 a day, our reporter was told by Dark Blue Professional, a UK-registered umbrella company, that they could take home 78% of their salary, which is more than they would have made through a standard umbrella company. Kay from Dark Blue Professional explained how the scheme works: ""You receive one payment which is a PAYE [pay as you earn] salary payment, that's taxed and you receive a payslip - and the residual balance is then paid as an investment payment."" ""You receive your second amount into your account…and because it's done that way there is no tax liability on the second proportion,"" she told us. As a result, a healthcare worker earning £725 per week would be able to pocket £60 more than if they used a standard umbrella company. But what Kay did not say is that Dark Blue Professional would take £80 a week in fees, four times the industry standard, and that the government would be cheated out of up to half the tax that it should have received. Kay insisted the scheme is tax compliant. But similar types of scheme have been challenged by HMRC in the past, which has left thousands of workers with crippling tax bills. Some even faced losing their homes, leaving their finances in tatters. Responding to the findings of Money Box investigation, Judith Freedman - professor of taxation law and policy at Oxford University - said: ""There's a strong likelihood that HMRC will challenge them [the schemes] successfully. ""Not only could the individual taxpayers be left with a big tax bill and a lot of hassle, but they have already paid relatively large fees to the promoters, so they are much worse off than they would have been doing things in a straightforward way,"" she said. ""It is distressing that people are trying to sell these schemes with…minimal explanation of the risks. Everything possible needs to be done to stop the firms doing this before ordinary taxpayers get caught up in it."" 'Government doesn't like it' Money Box also spoke to a broker from Contracting Scout, which actively targets key workers with adverts on Twitter and LinkedIn. ""Tim"", from Contracting Scout, offered to sign us up with an umbrella company also offering 78% take home pay. He explained that the umbrella companies he works with ""are taking advantage of a few tax loopholes"" and admitted that ""the government doesn't like it"". ""They [the government] do try and legislate against it, but legislation is extremely slow, so once the new legislation moves in there's a hundred different umbrellas that pop up next week with a different type of payment structure which doesn't get captivated by the law. ""So the goal posts are always moving and the providers are always trying to cater to that,"" he said. Neither of the two companies responded to the findings of our investigation. An HMRC spokesperson told Money Box ""it is shocking that unscrupulous promoters of tax avoidance schemes are targeting returning NHS workers during this difficult time. HMRC published [advice] on 30 March warning returning workers about this very issue. ""Our advice has always been to steer well clear of such schemes, and to report them to us in confidence for investigation"". There are more details of this story on Money Box and you can follow Anna and Money Box on Twitter.","""Unscrupulous"" firms are promising NHS workers big savings through tax dodging schemes that could leave them out of pocket."
"The Job Support Scheme, which will replace the furlough scheme, will see workers get three quarters of their normal salaries for six months. It aims to stop mass job cuts after the government introduced new measures to tackle a rise in coronavirus cases. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was part of a wider ""winter economy plan"". Nearly three million workers - or 12% of the UK's workforce - are currently on partial or full furlough leave, according to official figures. The current furlough scheme ends on 31 October. Mr Sunak said the new scheme would ""support only viable jobs"" as opposed to jobs that only exist because the government is continuing to subsidise the wages. At a press conference, Mr Sunak declined to comment on what defines a job as ""viable"". ""It is not for me to sit here and make pronouncements on every individual job,"" he said. ""What I want to be able to do is to provide as much support as possible given the constraints we operate in. We obviously can't sustain the same level of things that we were doing at the beginning of this crisis."" The government's contribution to workers' pay will fall sharply compared with the furlough scheme. Under furlough, it initially paid 80% of a monthly wage up to £2,500 - under the new scheme this will drop to 22%. ""The primary goal of our economic policy remains unchanged - to support people's jobs - but the way we achieve that must evolve,"" Mr Sunak said. ""I cannot save every business, I cannot save every job."" The new scheme begins on 1 November and will cost the government an estimated £300m a month. Companies who use it can also still claim the Job Retention Bonus, where the government pays £1,000 for every furloughed employee who comes back to work until at least the end of January. Mr Sunak said a similar scheme for the self-employed would be available. How will the Job Support Scheme work? New cliff-edge Business lobby group the CBI welcomed the government's plan. ""It is right to target help on jobs with a future, but can only be part-time while demand remains flat. This is how skills and jobs can be preserved to enable a fast recovery, ""said CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn. However, Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank said that the new jobs scheme on its own ""will not encourage firms to cut hours rather than jobs because the one-third employer contribution means it is much cheaper for firms to employ one person full-time than two people part-time"". ""But interaction with the £1,000 Job Retention Bonus is really important here,"" he said. ""When this new scheme is combined with that we've now got a big incentive for firms to retain workers part-time until you qualify for the bonus, i.e. the end of January is the new end of October cliff-edge."" 'I'm frightened' Tracey Sheppard is a cleaner at a leisure centre in Essex who's been on furlough since the end of March. She said she hoped the new Jobs Support Scheme will help her, but there are no guarantees. ""They're a very big company that I work for … but I don't' know whether they'd be able to afford to keep me on… I just don't know,"" she told the BBC's World At One. She said she feels ""frightened"" because her family only recently moved to the area and this is the only job she can fit in around childcare. ""I've just heard nothing [from my employer]. The last time I heard from them was the beginning of lockdown."" A cut in VAT for hospitality and tourism companies will also be extended until March. The cut from 20% to 5% VAT - which came into force on 15 July - had been due to expire on 12 January next year. However, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said this and the new jobs plan did ""not go far enough"" in helping the industry which has been hit by the government's new restrictions to stop coronavirus cases from rising. From Thursday, pubs and restaurants will have to close from 10pm in measures that could last for six months. FDF chief executive, Ian Wright, said: ""Only by continuing a targeted furlough scheme while the current restrictions remain will we avoid mass long-term unemployment and the decimation of a sector that could otherwise support our economic recovery once the pandemic is over."" Loan repayments Mr Sunak also announced that businesses that have borrowed money through the government's loan scheme would be given more time to repay the money. The chancellor said that small businesses who took out ""Bounce Back"" loans can use a new Pay as You Grow flexible repayment system. It means borrowings can be repaid over 10 years instead of the original six year term. The longer repayment time also applied to small and medium-sized firms who borrowed under the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme. Businesses will also have more time to apply for these loans, as well as the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme and the Future Fund. Application dates for the various schemes had been due to end in October and November. The furlough scheme was a bridge to carry livelihoods through the crisis. But the bridge needs to reach the other side of the gap to be effective. The chancellor's wage subsidy scheme is a continuation of that support - but it's of a different, less generous type. As employers will have to pay more than before, and employees will have to be working, it's aimed only at those businesses and posts that are viable. So some workers will slip through the gap: the government is keen that those in unsustainable jobs are spurred to think about their next move. And that means unemployment will still rise - although not as far perhaps as the four million some economists previously feared. The cost of the chancellor's new plan will run into billions, adding to the shortfall of £320bn the Treasury is already facing. At some point, taxes may have to rise to help plug that but there was no mention of that today, for it may be some time before the economy will be strong enough to take that on. But the bill facing the chancellor now is likely to be far smaller than the ultimate cost to the economy of doing nothing. Will this scheme benefit you? Do you have any questions about the scheme?

"The job cuts are on top of 6,000 roles already announced by Australia’s flag carrier earlier this year. Qantas announced a $2bn (£1bn) loss in August due to Covid-19 and associated border restrictions. “Unfortunately, Covid has turned aviation upside down,"" said Andrew David, the airline’s domestic and international chief executive. ""Airlines around the world are having to make dramatic decisions in order to survive and the damage will take years to repair,” he added. Qantas hopes to save about $74m annually, based on pre-Covid levels of flying, by switching to third-party providers instead of handling its own ground services. It also expects to save $59m over five years by avoiding new spending on ground handling equipment such as aircraft tugs and baggage loaders. Affected employees will be entitled to a redundancy package and given support to transition to new jobs, the airline said. Turbulence ahead There has been some good news for the airline’s recovery, with domestic routes starting to recover as state governments lift interstate travel restrictions. But Qantas is still predicting bleak times ahead, with more losses next year due to a drop in revenue of $7.4bn. It does not expect to fly internationally until late in 2021 - with the exception of a potential travel bubble with New Zealand. The airline has also taken on an additional $1.1bn debt in order to keep operating. It’s not alone. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) predicts airlines globally are on course to lose $157bn this year and next. Passenger numbers are expected to drop to 1.8bn this year from 4.5bn in 2019. IATA says those numbers will recover only partially to 2.8bn next year.","Qantas will outsource more than 2,000 ground staff roles in an effort to limit its financial losses."
"The travel company said pre-tax profits fell to £42m from £50m last year. It said the fall in demand for holidays in Turkey had been offset by the rise in popularity of other destinations.

""We have had to follow the demand of our customers, who are choosing to go to the Spanish islands and mainland."" Questioned about the impact of the falling pound on the company's future profits, Mr Fankhauser added: ""We don't see a noticeable impact so far and don't expect one next summer."" The company's underlying earnings fell by £2m to £308m, but the board recommended a dividend payment, of 0.5p a share, for the first time in five years. Its UK market continued to strengthen while it made record profits in northern Europe. Thomas Cook said it was ""a cautious approach to the year ahead"". It added that trading for the winter was in line with expectations, while bookings for next summer had made ""an encouraging early start"".","Thomas Cook's profits have fallen after a tough year for the tourism industry, with trading affected by terror attacks in Europe and political instability in Turkey."
"The British Bankers' Association, which fought the case, said it would not appeal after losing a court challenge against new rules on mis-selling. Barclays said it had set aside £1bn to pay compensation, and HSBC £269m, while RBS added £850m to the £200m it had already paid or provided for. Last week, Lloyds Banking Group made a £3.2bn provision for possible claims. Peter Vicary-Smith of the consumers' association Which? said the banks had now seen sense. ""It was a colossal error of judgment by the BBA to have brought this case in the first place, which has even further diminished the banking industry's reputation in the eyes of consumers,"" he said. ""PPI was mis-sold and complaints about it mishandled on an industrial scale for well over a decade. ""There could still be huge numbers of people out there who were duped into buying PPI and unaware they can make a claim,"" Mr Vicary-Smith added. Mis-sold The banks' decisions mean that several million people may now be eligible for a compensation payment. PPI policies are supposed to cover loan repayments if someone falls ill, has an accident or loses their job. But 16 million have been sold since 2005 alone and many are thought to have been mis-sold. In some cases they were sold to self-employed people who would not have been able to claim, to borrowers who were wrongly told that taking PPI was a condition for being granted their loan, and even to consumers who did not realise they were taking out a policy. Last month the High Court ruled that the banks had to obey the new rules of the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which require them to go back over all their past sales to see if the customers have a claim for mis-selling. 'Important step' In a statement the BBA said: ""In the interest of providing certainty for their customers, the banks and the British Bankers' Association have decided that they do not intend to appeal."" RBS confirmed on Monday that it would also be addressing customers' complaints, and in a further statement put the total expected loss at over £1bn. ""Although the costs of PPI redress and its administration are subject to a degree of uncertainty, RBS will record an additional provision of £850m in the second quarter of 2011,"" the bank said. ""To date, RBS has paid compensation to customers of [about] £100m, and has an existing provision of [about] £100m."" Adam Scorer, of Consumer Focus said the banks should ensure users received their money ""quickly and efficiently."" ""The entire episode is an embarrassment for our High Street banks - it is now time to wipe the slate clean, pay up and look to learn lessons for the future,"" he said. ""Refunding billions of pounds to millions of people will be a mammoth undertaking and to get it wrong would add insult to injury."" 'We apologise' Barclays' chief executive Bob Diamond said the bank would now begin the process of compensating customers. ""We don't always get things right: when we get them wrong, we apologise and put them right. ""We have taken this decision because it is in the best interests of our customers, as well as for Barclays and its shareholders,"" Mr Diamond said. The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) welcomed the banks' decision to deal with the mis-selling. ""Consumers should come to us at the ombudsman if they're unsure about what to do next,"" said chief ombudsman Natalie Ceeney. ""Meanwhile we will be working with the banks, over the coming weeks, to ensure that consumers' complaints are dealt with fairly and promptly."" Better record One leading mortgage lender, the Nationwide building society, distanced itself from the banks that tried to challenge the FSA. It said it had continued to process new PPI complaints while the High Court case was being heard. It pointed out it expected to pay only £10m in compensation and had a much better record of dealing with such complaints. ""Looking at the FOS complaints league table (for the second half of 2010) the society is ranked 102 out of 106 firms based on fewer than 650 complaints,"" said a spokesman for the society. ""Thirteen per cent of the society's complaints were upheld by FOS in favour of the customer, compared to an industry average of 63%."" FSA scrutiny The FSA has previously estimated that the banks will have to pay up to £4.5bn to settle tens of thousands of claims. That now appears to be an underestimate. The regulator requires the banks and other PPI sellers to look at all past sales and, if there is any evidence of ""systemic"" mis-selling, to write to the affected groups of customers and invite them to make a claim. This means that not all past customers will be contacted directly, as not all policies were mis-sold in the first place. However, any customer who has a concern is encouraged to lodge a complaint first rather than wait for the bank to take the initiative. An FSA spokesman explained that the regulator employs teams of supervisors for each individual institution, and also has a special team looking at just the PPI problem, which would ensure that the banks and other sellers of PPI did not dodge their responsibilities. Although the FSA can only enforce its rules on sales made after January 2005, when it took over regulation of PPI sales, customers can still complain to a bank about sales before then.",The banking industry has abandoned a legal fight over the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI).
"By David WolmanAuthor and journalist Last week, Canada minted its last penny. Eurozone countries are working to restrict cash payments. Bitcoin is all the rage. Payments start-ups such as Square and iZettle are on a cash-killing mission, while non-profit organisations, governments, the World Bank, small businesses, multinational corporations, app developers, hippies, libertarians, liberals, right-wingers all have agendas that can be advanced by alternatives to cash, and they're all pushing to bring them about. But like forecasts of flying cars, predictions of a cashless future have a history of failure. This is in part because progress is incremental, and in part because physical money is a time-tested technology. It's fast, widely accepted, anonymous and useful for old-school budgeting and when the power goes out. Yet powerful forces are aligning against cash. Together, they provide a glimpse of what a cashless or mostly cashless future might look like, and illuminate the promise of digital money, irrespective of whether cash is ever kaput or just increasingly marginalised. Faster and cheaper The battery against cash is coming from three fronts - new technologies, scepticism about the stewardship of sovereign currencies and increased enthusiasm for alternative currencies, and greater scrutiny about cash's myriad costs. (Think anti-counterfeiting cops and armoured trucks, bank security, tax evasion, terrorists using 200-euro or $100 notes to buy explosives, and every cash-related crime ever.) Digital money innovations, particularly tools anchored to mobile phones, offer faster and cheaper ways to pay bills, buy and sell goods, send and receive money and make bank transactions. Alternative currencies, meanwhile, are moving from the fringe to the centre, as more and more people worry about the long-term value of coin of the realm. Angst about government currencies has traditionally sent people flocking to gold, and for many devotees of the shiny stuff, gold remains the one and forever answer. But gold is not value incarnate. It's just another commodity, albeit a historically pivotal and impressively hefty one. Those who grasp that fact, yet still distrust central bank-issued currencies, are turning to local and online options, barter exchanges, and the crypto-currency Bitcoin. But the most consequential aspect of this monetary revolution is growing recognition that the costs of cash fall disproportionately on the poor. When was the last time you saw a wealthy person patronise a cheque-cashing service, use Western Union or visit a payday lender (for an above-board transaction, I mean)? Cash is expensive not merely because of the risk of being robbed at the cash machine or losing your savings to a fire, flood or abusive spouse. It's also expensive because of steep prices paid in time, fees and opportunity costs. For you and me, those costs are, by and large, nominal. But for the billions of people who subsist on $2 (£1.28) a day, they are anything but. Going mobile Digital tools are already providing millions of people worldwide with the opportunity to avoid cash. And avoid it they do. They are storing value and transacting by way of electronic accounts ""on"" their mobile phones. For the first time, people who were trapped in the informal economy can steer clear of usurious local moneylenders, save precious time and money, and benefit from the basic financial services that you and I take for granted. And no, looping people into the formal economy isn't a clandestine Valentine to banks and bankers. The fact is that a bank account, online bill, person-to-person payment, access to credit, insurance - all of these tools for building economic stability depend on money in electronic form. If you don't have that, it's far more difficult to climb permanently out of poverty. The truth is that it doesn't matter all that much whether cash's further marginalisation ever leads to extinction. What matters far more is the potential for digital money innovations to improve the welfare of so many. David Wolman is a contributing editor at Wired and the author of The End of Money, due out in paperback this autumn.",Cash has been taking a beating lately.
"The 100-year-old Strutt & Parker (Farms) Ltd is up for sale for an estimated £200m and includes more than 30,000 acres of East Anglian farmland. Land prices have been falling since 2015 amid uncertainty over the continuation of subsidies for farmers. The government has guaranteed farming subsidies at the current EU level only until the 2022 election. The privately owned Strutt & Parker received £1,267,000 in subsidies through the rural payments agency in 2017. The whole business generates income of about £21m a year. The price of prime arable land peaked in 2014 at around £10,000 per acre and is now close to £9,000. Farmers have also said that the falling number of migrant farm workers is ramping up costs and reducing farms' profitability. This month, the government introduced a temporary visa scheme for up to 2,500 workers for the period immediately following the UK's departure from the EU in March next year. Diversified business The land, which stretches across Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, also contains commercial and residential units, as well as renewable energy projects. The farming business includes four main farms, contracting and joint ventures, a sheep enterprise across Ministry of Defence land in Norfolk, a farming enterprise in Cambridgeshire and Lavenham Fen Farms. Last year, the company converted 34 acres of farmland into a natural burial site, Old Park Meadows near Chelmsford, which is included in the sale. The sale is being handled by Savills real estate agents and Deloitte. David Jones, a corporate finance partner at Deloitte, said: ""In our experience, interest is likely to come from a number of sources, due to the scale and diverse asset base, and we anticipate there will be interest from both domestic and overseas high-net-worth individuals. ""For the overseas buyer, the current weakness of the pound against the dollar adds to the attraction. We also anticipate enquiries from institutions looking for long-term asset-backed investments."" Strutt & Parker (Farms) is separate from Strutt & Parker estate agents, although they were both founded by the same two families in the 19th Century.",The sale of one of the country's largest farming operations is to test Brexit's impact on farmland prices.
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter ""When China comes calling it's not always to the good of your citizens,"" he said. ""When they show up with deals that seem too good to be true, it's often the case that they, in fact, are."" The reference to deals was a thinly veiled attempt at punching holes in Beijing's One Belt One Road programme - a $124bn Chinese project aimed at facilitating trade and investment links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond. It was first unveiled by President Xi Jinping in 2013, and has largely been seen as his baby - but is seen by critics as part of China's plan to increase its global influence. The programme has come under fire recently for what some have called ""debt diplomacy"" - implying that when you do a deal with China, you end up in debt. Analysts say the US pressure on Beijing has empowered other countries to speak up against China when in the past they would have kept quiet. Sri Lanka, Malaysia and even Pakistan have all expressed concerns about the programme. And China isn't just facing American criticism on the Belt and Road programme. Read more from Karishma: Take the comments from the US Defense Secretary James Mattis at this weekend's Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) defence meeting, for instance. The US typically criticises China's operations in the South China Sea at these summits, but this time he went a step further. ""We will not be intimidated, and we will not stand down, for we cannot accept [China's] militarisation of the South China Sea or any coercion in this region,"" Mr Mattis said, according to the Hill, whilst reaffirming the US's commitment to the region and to the freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. The comments by Mr Pompeo and Mr Mattis should not be seen in isolation. They are part of what many observers have told me is an increasingly aggressive narrative on China from the Trump administration on pretty much every front. It's a narrative we should not be surprised by. It's been consistently signalled, and perhaps nowhere more blatantly than in the US Vice-President Mike Pence's recent speech at the Hudson Institute on the US administration's policy towards China. He said ""Beijing is employing a whole-of-government approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its interests in the United States"". Mr Pence is due to attend the APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) summit in Papua New Guinea next month, where he is likely to come face to face with China's President Xi Jinping who is also expected to attend. Papua New Guinea is the latest country to join China's One Belt One Road programme and it is yet another arena where you can expect the battle for influence between the US and China to play out. While the US sees the trade war as an opportunity to right the wrongs it believes it has suffered at the hands of China for decades of unfair trade, Beijing sees the trade war as the Trump administration's attempts at curbing China's rise. So even if the two sides come to some sort of a resolution on trade - which in itself is highly unlikely at this point - this is not a conflict that is going to disappear. Neither side is going to give in quickly. This is just the beginning.","If you needed any further evidence that the trade war between the US and China is not just about trade, consider what US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said about the world's second-largest economy during a recent trip to Latin America."
"The biggest increase in cash payouts came from US firms at $52bn. Henderson said global dividends would rise by just 1% this year because of lower oil prices and slowing economies. Another factor acting as a drag on dividends would be the recent rise in the value of the dollar, the firm said. This will depress the value of dividend income from around the world once it has been translated into the US currency. ""2014 was a superb year for income investors, with developed markets leading the charge,"" said Alex Crooke at Henderson Global Investors. ""After such a strong performance in 2014, we now expect a pause for breath in 2015."" Compounding growth About one-third of global dividend income came from firms on the US stock market. In 2014, dividend changes varied considerably from region to region: Global dividend income has now risen by 60% in the five years since 2009, far outstripping inflation and savers' interest rates in the UK, and also the growth of economies around the world. That underlines the vital importance to investors of dividend income, especially when share prices have stagnated, as reinvesting the dividends increases the value of a shareholding in a similar fashion to compound interest. Changes ahead? Dividend payments are not evenly spread among companies, nor are they necessarily predictable despite firms often saying they aim to offer their shareholders steadily rising payouts. Just 10 firms accounted for 11% of all global payouts in 2014, and the top 20 accounted for 18% of all dividends. They were led by Vodafone whose huge special dividend early last year meant it was responsible for 20% of all UK dividend payments. Other giant payers in the past year have been oil firms such as Shell, banks such as China Construction Bank and HSBC, and technology companies such as Apple and Microsoft. By contrast, mining firms cut their dividends for the the third year in a row. ""This was a result of commodity companies suffering from lower prices of their products in the face of slowing global demand,"" said the Henderson report. With the recent big fall in the oil price, Mr Crooke added: ""We don't expect developed market oil companies to reduce their dividends in 2015, but there is a strong likelihood that emerging market producers will pay out markedly less this year as their profitability comes under pressure."" The research was compiled by adding up the dividends paid by the 1,200 biggest firms whose shares are traded on stock exchanges around the world. The rest of the dividend income from smaller firms was estimated.","The total dividend income paid to shareholders around the world rose by 11% last year to $1.167 trillion, according to investment firm Henderson Global Investors."
"Falls in clothing and food prices were the main contributors to the change in the rate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS said the rate was also affected by a smaller rise in air fares in June than a year ago. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said he expects inflation to remain low in the immediate short term. But the Bank expects it to start picking up around the turn of the year. The rate of Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation - which includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax - was 1% in June, unchanged from May. ""Inflation has continued its pattern of recent months, when prices have been very little changed on the previous year,"" said Philip Gooding from the ONS. ""The headline rate for June has dropped very slightly on May, back to zero, thanks to small downwards effects from movements in clothing and food prices and air fares."" The CPI rate has been hovering around zero since February, and moved into negative territory in April for the first time on record, dropping to -0.1%. 'Rude health' Howard Archer, chief UK economist at Global Insight, said the latest figure was good news for consumers. ""With earnings growth currently seeing clear improvement and employment high and rising, purchasing power is currently in rude heath,"" he added. While flat or low inflation can be good news for consumers, a prolonged period of negative inflation is generally perceived as harmful to an economy. The fear is that people will defer spending in the hope that goods or services will become cheaper later. The current inflation figure is well below the Bank of England's target of around 2%. 'Questions' Core inflation, which excludes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, fell last month to 0.8%. That was down from 0.9% and the joint-lowest rate since 2001. ""The data therefore raise questions over the whether underlying price pressures are really picking up to the extent than the Bank of England is anticipating,"" said Chris Williamson, chief UK economist at Markit. He said that attention would now turn to Wednesday's wage growth data, ""The Bank of England needs to determine whether pay growth will continue to accelerate as firms compete for staff, or whether low inflation will keep the overall rate of increase below levels that would normally worry the monetary policy committee into hiking interest rates,"" he added.","The rate of UK Consumer Prices Index inflation fell to 0% in June, from 0.1% in May, official figures show."
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter Millions of Hong Kong citizens have taken part in pro-democracy protests that have drawn the ire of many in mainland China. Just this past weekend, thousands of people took to the streets to mark the fifth anniversary of China's government banning full democratic elections in Hong Kong, despite police outlawing the protests. And on Sunday, demonstrators aimed to block access to the airport by suspending transport links in the city. Business is counting the cost of the damage these protests have inflicted on the reputation of Hong Kong as a global financial hub, but far more worrying for companies is what many say is the strong-arming by China of companies in Hong Kong. Cathay Pacific provides the strongest example yet of how perceived missteps in Beijing's eyes can harm businesses in the territory. Dressed in black and carrying signs, hundreds of protesters gathered at a rally last week to support staff from the airline who say they lost their jobs because they supported the protests. No gas masks or tear gas here, just ordinary workers trying to make their voices heard. Many at the rally told me they were worried they could lose their jobs too - simply for thinking or saying something Beijing may not like. ""It's become more like China,"" one woman told me. ""These are tactics used by Communist governments to silence people. Like allowing colleagues to tell on each other, just because they see something that is not in favour of the government. They could report that to the authorities and get that member of staff to be fired for no other reason."" 'Difficult tightrope' It's not an unrealistic fear. Earlier this month Cathay Pacific saw the high-profile resignation of chief executive Rupert Hogg, who said he had to take responsibility for the controversy over some of his staff joining pro-democracy protests, angering Beijing. But many speculated Mr Hogg was forced out, because that's what China wanted. ""I've never seen anything quite like this,"" said one prominent businessman in Hong Kong, who didn't want to be identified. ""We have to walk a difficult tightrope now,"" he said. ""No multinational is leaving yet, I've not seen any evidence of capital outflows, but companies are going to have to tell their staff to be far more careful about what they say and what they do. The Cathay Pacific example was a warning from Beijing."" Pressure mounts Many in this city don't see themselves as part of China. They value being distinct and separate. One country two systems has meant the rules have always been different here, and that's what's helped Hong Kong thrive. But the sense now is that's changing. Many in Hong Kong's crucial financial industry are reluctant to talk about how they're reacting to the political shifts, fearful of being singled out by China. But sometimes actions speak louder than words. Take, for example, the full page ads in newspapers that banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered took out to condemn the violence in Hong Kong. Analysts say for companies that make most of their revenue from China, it is now more important than ever to be seen as supportive of Beijing's position on the protests. Transport shutdown And there's already evidence that some businesses are bowing to pressure from Beijing. Hong Kong's MTR Corp runs the subway system in the city. It's used by the majority of Hong Kongers and is seen as a world class transport service. It's also the main way protesters have been making their way around the city during the weekend demonstrations. That's led to harsh editorials in China's government mouthpieces the People's Daily and Global Times which have slammed MTR Corp for allowing them on board. Subsequently the railway operator closed down stations on two of its main lines over a weekend when protests were being held, in a move that was widely seen as giving in to China's demands - which it denied. While MTR Corp doesn't make as much money from the Chinese market as Cathay Pacific does, it does operate some lines on the mainland and saw revenues from China grow by 44% in 2018. The harsh reality is that companies will have to ""bend like bamboo"", and do what Beijing wants if they want to keep servicing the Chinese market, says Steve Vickers who runs a political risk consultancy in Hong Kong. Mr Vickers says in the future Hong Kong-based firms may have to employ government liaisons the way they have in China, to navigate the increasingly tricky political landscape. ""At the end of this, I think we will see further control from Beijing,"" he told me. ""Does toeing the line with Beijing now damage my [standing in the] global market?"" he said, referring to the decision businesses based in Hong Kong have to make and the difficult position they're in - whether to side with pro-democracy protesters, or against them. ""Or do I kowtow now and protect my position on the mainland? That's the big decision that people are making."" But it's a contract that veterans in Hong Kong have always understood. In the city's iconic entertainment district Lan Kwai Fong, I met Allan Zeman, the man who helped to build it. Dotted with bars and restaurants, and people spilling out onto the streets enjoying the midweek revelry, you can almost forget that this is a city beset by protests. Mr Zeman told me that doing business in China means understanding the culture, and that all Beijing wants is some 'respect.' ""I've been in China for more than 35 years, I've done business there for 35 years,"" he told me. ""I understand it. These are the rules. If you want to do business there abide by the rules."" It sounds simple enough, but it's at the root of the conundrum now facing Hong Kong.","Foreign companies face a new business reality in Hong Kong. There's a rising sense of uncertainty washing over the corporate world here, as firms confront a shifting political landscape after months of unrest."
"The west London Conservative authority will reduce the tax by 3% in April, the sixth year out of seven it has done so. It shares many of its operations with neighbouring boroughs Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea. But, Labour's Stephen Cowan, at H&F, accused the Tories of recouping losses, by ""bringing in big hikes in more than 500 council stealth taxes"". According to the BBC's Local Government Correspondent, Mike Sergeant, Rochdale and York are among the few councils across England who may increase council tax, with most expected to freeze the fee. 'Lean and agile' Communities secretary Eric Pickles has called on other councils to follow H&F and adopt innovative ways of protecting frontline services and keeping council tax down. H&F, which said its ethos meant it was more ""lean, agile and in tune with residents concerns than ever before"", said it would also be freezing parking charges. Its leader, councillor Nicholas Botterill, said: ""While council tax is falling year after year, our parks have never been greener, our streets are cleaner, our schools have never performed better and residents are noticing the improvements."" He said the top three factors to improving front-line services while delivering savings are to strip out duplicated layers of management, reduce debt repayments to the banks and drive down accommodation costs and overhead. Meanwhile, Labour Group leader Mr Cowan said: ""I welcome the £25 total reduction off the yearly council tax bill but am against to the silly ways they waste public money. ""Two years ago the Conservatives increased parking charges by 55%, they added £220 to child care charges in one year and voted through new charges for residents who use a personal trainer in local parks."" He also claimed they had wasted £70m on new Town Hall offices. A Hammersmith and Fulham Council spokesman said Mr Cowan's claim about the £70m was incorrect. He said the authority's planners had approved the King Street regeneration project for the area around Hammersmith Town Hall in November 2011, and the proposals were referred to London mayor Boris Johnson. The council then withdrew the application because the Greater London Authority had concerns over the proposed height of two of the residential blocks. The spokesman said the plans would not have had any cost to the taxpayer as they would have been financed by the developers selling flats. He said plans for a new scheme were likely to be put forward at a later date.","Hammersmith and Fulham (H&F) has become the first authority in England this year, to announce a council tax cut."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter It said that a ""small number of coins"" were affected when they were struck at a rapid rate during production. The Royal Mint is striking 1.5 billion new 12-sided £1 coins, introduced to help crack down on counterfeiting. Out of shape versions of the coin, considered collectors' items, are appearing on internet auction sites. The Sun newspaper has spoken to a number of people reporting warped coins, although doubts have been raised about the cause of reported highly-damaged coins. A spokeswoman for the Royal Mint, which produces three million new £1 coins a day at its headquarters in Llantrisant, South Wales, said: ""The Royal Mint produces around five billion coins each year, and will be striking 1.5 billion new £1 coins in total. ""As you would expect, we have tight quality controls in place, however variances will always occur in a small number of coins, particularly in the striking process, due to the high volumes and speed of production."" The Mint has claimed the new £1 is the ""most secure coin in the world"", replacing the previous £1 coin, of which about one in 40 are thought to be fake. 'I got a badly minted pound coin from a Chinese takeaway' Kristofer Bramwell from Kegworth in Derby tells the BBC: ""I paid for my food with a £20 note and it was in the change. I received it with a pristine minted new 1 pound coin. ""After getting home and eating the takeaway, I took the change out of my coat pocket and I found the badly minted pound coin. ""The edge of the £1 coin is partially 12 sided and rounded where it clearly has not been pressed correctly by the machine."" Philip Munsell, director of Coin News magazine, told the BBC that only a tiny minority of these new coins would be affected, but that fact made them highly collectable. ""The thing about the Royal Mint is that they are very, very good with their quality control, so therefore if you have something that has passed through without being quality checked then it is likely to be collectable, it is likely to therefore be worth more than one pound,"" he said. He said that if the middle of the two-piece £1 coin was missing, it would not get through the quality checks. The new coin has a string of anti-counterfeiting details, including material inside the coin itself which can be detected when electronically scanned by coin-counting or payment machines. Other security measures include an image that works like a hologram, and micro-sized lettering inside both rims. However, it is not the first currency launch to have hit problems in recent months. Vegans and some religious groups have voiced concerns about the new polymer £5 note introduced in September last year, as it contains a small amount of tallow, which is derived from meat products. Meanwhile, the old £1 coin remains as legal tender until 15 October this year, after which shops are under no obligation to accept it. The new £1 coin: Vital statistics Thickness: 2.8mm - thinner than old coin Weight: 8.75g - lighter than old coin Diameter: 23.43mm - larger than old coin Number to enter circulation: 1.5 billion - about 23 per person. Old £1 coins will be melted down to make new ones Outer ring: gold-coloured, made from nickel-brass Inner ring: silver-coloured, made from nickel-plated alloy","Some new £1 coins - introduced into circulation last month as the ""most secure coin in the world"" - may be defective, the Royal Mint has admitted."
"After weeks of politicking, lobbying and vote-trading, the Republican-controlled Congress is set to vote on the plan. If it passes it will give President Donald Trump an early Christmas present - his first major piece of legislation since taking office. Republicans say the tax cuts for businesses and families will unleash investment, spending and growth. But critics say it will result in a huge transfer of wealth from poor to rich, and future generations will have to pay for it. So what are the key points in the plan? Lower corporate taxes It's being described as the biggest single drop in corporation tax in US history. Under current law, businesses face a range of tax rates, starting at 15% and rising to 35% on taxable income over $10m. The new plan creates a single 21% corporate rate, effective in 2018. That is low, but not quite as low as the 20% rate included in earlier versions of the plan. No health insurance requirement Current law requires people to carry health insurance or face a tax penalty. That mandate is eliminated in the new code, a provision that the Joint Committee on Taxation projects could raise $318bn, since it is expected to lead to 13 million fewer people with insurance coverage. Lower individual rates, temporarily The US currently has seven tax brackets ranging from 10% to a top rate of 39.6%, which applies to income above about $418,000 for individuals and $471,00 for couples. Under the new plan, some of those rates fall, including the top rate, which would be 37%, applicable to income over $500,000 for individuals and $600,000 for couples. The lower rates expire after 2025. Less inheritance tax Under current law, inheritances worth more than about $5.5m for individuals and roughly $11m for couples are subject to a 40% tax. The new plan roughly doubles the amount of inheritance exempt from tax. That provision expires after 2025. Larger standard deductions, but fewer targeted perks Under current law, taxpayers can either claim a standard deduction or opt to deduct specific items. The new plan roughly doubles the standard deduction to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples. In exchange for that boost - which expires after 2025 and is intended to make the itemising option less attractive - the plan eliminates a slew of targeted benefits, such as deductions for moving expenses and tax preparation costs. More oil drilling Republicans in the Senate attached a measure that will open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. That made it into the final version. An expanded child tax credit The Republican plan eliminates the personal exemption, which was worth roughly $4,000 and could be claimed for each member of a family. To offset that move, the plan expands a tax credit for children. That is currently worth $1,000 per child for families who make less than a certain amount. Under the new plan, it would be worth $2,000 and available to more families. Debate over how much the child tax credit would be worth almost killed the bill, after Senator Marco Rubio, Republican from Florida, said he wanted the provision structured to be more generous for low income families. The benefit expires after 2025. Lower taxes on overseas profits Multinational companies currently pay US taxes on income earned abroad. The new plan changes the code to a so-called territorial system, making companies responsible for income earned in the US. It also creates new rules to prevent companies from unfairly taking advantage of the shift. The plan also imposes one-time, ultra-low tax rates for corporate profits currently being held offshore, charged at 15.5% on liquid assets and 8% for illiquid assets. Lower pass through taxes Under current law, owners of businesses organised as so-called pass through entities pay taxes on profits based on the personal rate (since the profits ""pass through"" to the owners). The new bill allows for 20% of that income to be deducted for households making less than $315,00. After that, the perk is only available to some businesses. Some business 'loopholes' stay Republicans had threatened to eliminate a number of industry specific benefits. But the final version is less aggressive than earlier proposals. For example, the bill preserves tax perks for wind energy. Other changes The plan caps the deduction for state and local taxes at $10,000. Preserving some kind of deduction was important to Republicans from high-cost states such as California, New Jersey and New York. It also retains the mortgage interest deduction, a priority of the powerful property lobby, while lowering the cap on what new mortgages are eligible for the perk from $1m to $750,000. The bill does not subject graduate school tuition waivers to taxes, as had been proposed. The plan also maintains, and temporarily expands, deductions for certain medical expenses.",US lawmakers have unveiled the final draft of a bill set to be the most significant overhaul of the US tax code in a generation.
"Six planes are up for sale on the Ebay-style consumer-to-consumer shopping portal. The cheapest plane on offer, the Jabiru J160C, has received 23 bids so far, the highest being 1m yuan (£103,000; $163,000). Bidding for the most expensive unit, a helicopter, starts at 16.8m yuan. But it has not received any bids as yet. There have been no bids for the other four planes on offer as well. Bidders have to put down a deposit of 50,000 yuan for each plane, except the J160C which needs a deposit of just 2,000 yuan. The buyers will need to obtain a certificate of airworthiness for their craft from China's Civil Aviation Administration. China's robust economic growth in recent years has seen the rise of a large number of millionaires in the country. That has seen the private jet market take off and some aircraft manufacturers have predicted that the country is likely to become one of the biggest markets for the industry in coming years.","Alibaba, China's biggest e-commerce group, has started selling aircraft on its shopping website Taobao."
"She sold the fashion company that bears her name back in 2004, and it's now been put up for sale again by the bank that currently owns it. Karen Millen still has an interest in retail though and told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Money programme that for the High Street to survive, ""we have to step back and look where it's going"". This year has been particularly tough for retailers, with businesses such as Topshop and Debenhams having to battle with their creditors to approve Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs) which have allowed them to close some stores and cut rents on others. The High Street has also seen chains going into administration, including the fashion chain Select in May, while figures from the British Retail Consortium this year indicated that one in 10 shops are lying empty in town centres across the UK. But Ms Millen says High Streets need to make themselves attractive destinations as ""it's still about experience"". ""People are looking for combining shopping with an experience and social time, a place you can eat, meet friends and shop,"" she says. ""It's a place where you won't be rushed, and you can find something that is destination-based, whether it's for entertainment, food, products or the environment, and walk away with a gift for the home."" Karen Millen the company is now up for sale. ""I think it was inevitable,"" she says, ""it's been owned by a bank for several years now. ""In 2008 when things went crash, it was taken into the ownership of Kaupthing Bank. They don't run businesses, they fund them. We've seen the change in that time. it lost its direction, and I'm surprised they hadn't sold it sooner."" Although Ms Millen parted ways with the store that bears her name, she hopes it does survive. ""I'd like to think it could. I'd like to leave a legacy behind, it's something I'm very proud of, or was proud of, and it does need a new home now."" ""Whoever buys it needs to put it back where it needs to be. The structure right now is not working, and it's the same across many High Street stores working on an old model that no longer works. ""Stores need to close, changes need to happen."" 'I'm a resilient tough person' Karen Millen was dealt a blow by HMRC in 2017 when she was declared bankrupt at the High Court over an unpaid tax bill of £6m. The bill came from her involvement in a tax planning scheme, the validity of it was successfully challenged by HMRC in 2010. Karen said the bankruptcy was due to poor advice from her accountants. ""By having professionals advise me, I believed and listened to them - that's what I paid them to do,"" she says. ""I thought I was taking care of my affairs, I was advised wrongly and it was unfortunate it ended in bankruptcy. It wasn't a case of the HMRC, it was the advice I got initially, it was the case that the banks were bankrupt - where all my money was invested - so I lost it all, and I couldn't pay the tax."" Karen Millen said she was able to bounce back from the decision. ""It was tough; I'm a resilient tough person though,"" she said. ""I don't like having regrets, I believe in focusing on the future and learning from your mistakes.""","""Retail isn't dead - it's taking a new direction,"" says designer and retail entrepreneur Karen Millen."
"By Stephen EvansBBC News, Berlin All the same, Mr Toft, the head brewer of a tiny brewery in Bavaria, in the south of the country, politely preaches that Germany's beer-makers should be more adventurous. In a nation very proud of its beer, he is an outsider who thinks the natives could do better. Not that Mr Toft looks like an outsider. With his curly fair hair, and the fact he almost always wears lederhosen - the traditional Alpine leather shorts - he could pass for a Bavarian. Mr Toft, who first went to Germany to study brewing and ended up staying, is brew master at the 234-year-old Schonram brewery, based in the village of the same name near the border between Germany and Austria. He is passionate about beer, and although he works within the constraints of the Reinheitsgebot, the country's beer purity law, in addition to more traditional German brews he makes British-style beers, such as India Pale Ale (IPA). While such a state of affairs may make many Germans cough into their helles or dunkel lager, Mr Toft says other smaller German brewers should also explore new flavour possibilities while not breaking the law. After all, sales of his newer recipes are rising strongly, at a time when overall beer consumption in Germany is now at a 20-year low. Unesco appeal The Reinheitsgebot was first applied to Bavaria in 1516, before subsequently covering the whole of Germany from 1906. In its original text, the law stipulated that beer could only be made from water, barley and hops. Yeast was later added to the list when its vital role in brewing became understood, and wheat was subsequently also allowed. Yet the practice in other countries of adding cheaper ingredients to beer, such as rice, maize, and sugar is forbidden. As is fruit, which is often added to Belgian ales, or - heaven forbid - anything artificial. So revered is the Reinheitsgebot that the German Brewers' Association applied in December of last year for the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) to give it protected ""world heritage"" status. It used to be that Unesco only accorded monuments and other physical sites World Heritage status, but recently it's been widened to include ""intangible"" treasures. The tango dance and French cuisine are already on the list, and the German brewers want the Reinheitsgebot to follow suit. Marc-Oliver Huhnholz, spokesman for the German Brewery Association, says the law means that when people drink a German beer they know it is ""absolutely pure"". ""We made a survey [in Germany], and asked people if they wanted to have beer brewed under the purity law, and more than 90% said they wanted to stick to the purity law. ""There are some things that Germany stands for and one of them is German beer... we want to show the world that we have a very old tradition."" But there is no doubt the Reinheitsgebot is also a constraint. As already mentioned, it means German breweries cannot flavour their beer with fruit, something their counterparts in Belgium routinely do to much acclaim. At a time when sales of beer in Germany continue to fall, Mr Toft thinks the ancient regulations make many German brewers believe - wrongly in his mind - that they have to keep to the same old ways, and the same old beers. ""For a lot of brewers, it's an easy excuse to say, 'I can't think outside the box, so we'll carry on business as usual,'"" he says. ""But, actually, the Reinheitsgebot ought to be an incentive to be creative, because we are forced to think of ways of making different flavours within the law."" Popular with women Salvation comes in the main from the not-so-humble hop flower, which gives all beers a level of bitterness. While most hops grown in Germany are mild and subtle ones used for making lager, hops from the UK - and especially the US - can also impart a distinct fruitiness to beer, with flavours like orange, grapefruit, and peach. Such fruity hops are now starting to be grown in Germany, and mean that brewers such as Mr Toft can increasingly produce brews that taste more like a British real ale or American craft beer. The result is that sales of the new fruitier beers are selling very well, especially among women, and that they have discovered new foreign markets. Mr Toft says: ""We found these beers appeal to women who previously claimed they didn't like beer. And from that, it's become popular with their husbands."" He is also successfully marketing the beers to young people in Italy. Thorsten Schoppe, owner of the Schoppe Braeu microbrewery in Berlin, is using fruity hops to brew strong American-style craft ales. ""In Belgium they produce cherry beer,"" he says. ""If you produced it in Germany you would have to call it 'alcoholic beverage made with cherries', and that wouldn't be a beer. You have to write that on the label."" While Mr Schoppe says most people in German are pleased with the Reinheitsgebot because it means they don't have ""rubbish"" or ""artificial chemicals"" in their beer, he says it does limit small breweries that want to be creative and stand out from the crowd. In the past he has experimented with adding things such as herbs, honey, cinnamon and chilli to beer - all unacceptable in Germany. But at Schoppe Braeu Mr Schoppe is conjuring up new flavours, and higher sales, while sticking to the brewing law.",Eric Toft is on a mission to improve German beer - which is odd because he's an American.
"Members of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) expect prices to go up by 1.5% over the next 12 months, its latest survey found. This comes after a prediction of static prices at the start of the year. Over the next five years, they predict a 4% a year average increase in property values. At the beginning of 2013, they said there would be a 2.5% rise. 'Long wait' The Rics survey follows data from lenders and house builders suggesting that activity and house prices have risen in the last few months. Last week, the Halifax said that house prices were rising at their fastest annual rate for nearly three years. The lender said prices in the three months to the end of June were 3.7% higher than in the same quarter last year. This rise in prices had mainly been fuelled by increasing numbers of prospective buyers returning to the market, Rics said. ""After what has seemed like a very long wait we are finally starting to see what looks like the beginning of a recovery in the housing market,"" said Peter Bolton King, global residential director for Rics. ""It is important to remember that activity levels still remain depressed by historic standards but the various initiatives designed to encourage the provision of finance into the market do appear to be paying dividends."" These schemes include Funding for Lending, under which banks and building societies are able to borrow money cheaply from the Bank of England, as long as they lend it out to individuals and businesses. Although prices are rising on average, according to these surveys, the increase has been driven by London and the South East of England. Other areas have seen significant falls in property values in recent years, leaving some ground to make up. Housing market commentator Henry Pryor said the sentiment of the Rics survey should be treated with caution. ""Estate agents are optimists from birth and their glass is always half-full,"" he said. ""Government support for the housing market is clearly providing firm foundations for prices to build upon in many areas, but for the time being, schemes like Help to Buy are concentrated on new-build properties. We do not yet have a feel for how the second-hand market will fare.""",Surveyors are expecting house prices to keep rising as the UK housing market starts to record some momentum following a sluggish few years.
"The main financial indexes in the US closed down by more than 7%, while London's index of top shares ended the day nearly 8% lower. Similar drops took place across Europe and Asia as a row between Russia and Saudi Arabia saw oil prices plunge. Shares were already reeling from fears of the impact of coronavirus. Analysts described the market reaction as ""utter carnage"". In the US, the major stock indexes fell so sharply at the start of trading, that the buying and selling of shares was halted for 15 minutes, as a so-called ""circuit breaker"" aimed at curbing panicky selling came into effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average sank by 7.8% or more than 2,000 points - the biggest points-drop in history and the largest decline in percentage terms since the financial crisis. The S&P 500 fell 7.6%, while the Nasdaq dropped about 7.3%. The declines in London wiped some £125bn off the value of major UK firms. The UK and US falls were mirrored by similar declines in Europe, with the main stock market indexes in France, Germany and Spain all closing over 7% lower. ""There is panic setting into the market right now,"" said Andrew Lo, professor of finance at MIT's Sloan School of Management. ""Things are going to get worse before they get better."" Oil output disputes The dramatic drops were triggered by a row between Saudi Arabia and Russia over oil output. Saudi Arabia said it would slash prices and pump more oil, sparking fears of a price war. This came after Russia rejected a proposal by oil exporters to cut supply to cope with lower demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. Analysts said Saudi Arabia was ""flexing its muscles"" to protect its position in the oil market. On Monday, the price of international oil benchmark Brent fell almost a third in its biggest drop since the Gulf War in 1991 before recovering slightly to trade 20% lower. The price of oil had already fallen sharply this year as the coronavirus began to spread internationally, with demand for fuel expected to decline. 'Surprising' decision Those conditions make Saudi Arabia's decision to increase output ""extremely surprising"", said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""This is not the first time that we've had a shock to the oil market, but it is the first time that I can recall that you've had a supply shock and a demand shock at the same time,"" he said. ""The craziness that you're seeing in the oil prices today, and companies related to oil and gas, is a reflection of this being pretty unprecedented."" In the US and UK, oil firms led the market declines, with shares in Shell, BP and Chevron down about 15% or more. Premier Oil saw its shares more than halve in value. In Frankfurt and Paris, banks were hit hardest, while the Russian rouble tumbled about 8% to its weakest level since 2016. In Brazil, steep falls in morning trade also triggered a temporary pause with shares ending the day down 12%. Earlier, Asian markets had also fallen sharply, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index down 5% while Australia's ASX 200 slumped 7.3% - its biggest daily drop since 2008. In China, the benchmark Shanghai Composite fell 3%, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index sank 4.2%. Elsewhere on the markets, the price of gold hitting a seven-year high at one point, trading at $1,700 per ounce. Gold is often seen as a desirable asset to hold in times of uncertainty. And in a historic moment, demand for benchmark UK government bonds for two-, three-, four-, six- and seven-year maturities pushed prices so high that yields - or the rate of return on the bond - briefly turned negative for the first time. A negative yield means investors will lose money from holding the bond. Why should I care if stock markets fall? Many people's initial reaction to ""the markets"" is that they are not directly affected, because they do not invest money. Yet there are millions of people with a pension - either private or through work - who will see their savings (in what is known as a defined contribution pension) invested by pension schemes. The value of their savings pot is influenced by the performance of these investments. So big rises or falls can affect your pension, but the advice is to remember that pension savings, like any investments, are usually a long-term bet. Read more here. 'Far-reaching economic effects' While people have in the past responded to lower oil prices with making travel plans and other spending, the coronavirus is likely to curb that response, said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. And economists have said that if the decline in oil prices continue, they are likely to have far-reaching economic effects. This could potentially raise risk in debt markets or hurt investment in the energy sector, which plays an important economic role in many parts of the US. With uncertainty about the economy driven by questions about the coronavirus outbreak, leaders have a ""limited window of opportunity to contain the panic"", Prof Lo added. ""We can ask the public to be as confident as we want, but that's not going to restore confidence unless they see real progress,"" he said.","Shares around the world had their worst day since the financial crisis with the dramatic falls leading to the day being dubbed ""Black Monday""."
"The figure amounts to about three-quarters of all UK banknotes in existence. The cash is not used in transactions or held as savings, but may be overseas, tucked away in homes unreported or being used in the ""shadow economy"". The issue was first identified by the National Audit Office (NAO), which highlighted it in September. Now the Public Accounts Committee has said the Bank should ""get a better handle"" on the currency. The committee said there were ""implications for public policy and the public purse"" if a material proportion of that large volume of banknotes was being used for illegal purposes. However, the UK is not the only country to face this problem - and other major global currencies could well be more seriously affected. A Bank of England spokesperson said: ""It is the responsibility of the Bank of England to meet public demand for banknotes. The Bank has always met that demand and will continue to do so. ""Members of the public do not have to explain to the Bank why they wish to hold banknotes. This means that banknotes are not missing."" 'Stashed somewhere' However, the figure of £50bn is not disputed, even if the terminology is. The money ""is stashed somewhere, but the Bank of England doesn't know where, who by or what for - and doesn't seem very curious"", said Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee. ""It needs to be more concerned about where the missing £50bn is. Depending where it is and what it's being used for, that amount of money could have material implications for public policy and the public purse. ""The Bank needs to get a better handle on the national currency it controls."" Demand for banknotes has steadily gone up, although their use is in decline, but the Bank of England does not ""appear to have a convincing reason for why the demand for notes keeps increasing"", says the committee in a report. Recent debate over cash has centred on whether vulnerable people - who might struggle with digital payments - will have access to notes and coins in the future. MPs on the committee say that means little attention is being paid to the whereabouts of banknotes today. There is nothing wrong with stashing cash rather than spending it, assuming it is secure. But that makes little sense for your average saver who could get some interest, however small, by keeping it safely in a bank or building society. That is why MPs have their suspicions that many of these banknotes are being hidden for less innocent reasons instead. Ill-gotten gains This rising demand is ""a trend being seen with other major currencies"", as the committee itself admits. It particularly affects the dollar and the euro, which are widely held as reserve currencies around the world. In the case of the dollar, only about 15% of the US currency supply can be accounted for - a significantly lower proportion than for the UK. Both those currencies are more attractive to criminals because they have higher-denomination notes which make it easier to smuggle or stash ill-gotten gains. For instance, there are more $100 bills out there than any other denomination of the greenback, with 80% of them estimated to be held outside the US. As for the euro, the European Central Bank in Frankfurt no longer issues the €500 note because of concerns it could facilitate illegal activities. However, it remains legal tender, while €100 and €200 notes are still in production. By contrast, the highest-value note issued by the Bank of England is £50.","The Bank of England should be trying to track down £50bn of ""missing"" UK currency, a committee of MPs has said."
"By Fiona GrahamTechnology of business reporter, BBC News But since 2007, Kenya has been leading the way with an innovative mobile phone technology that has transformed the lives of millions of people and businesses. Mobile money transfer allows those without a bank account to transfer funds as quickly and easily as sending a text message. The most successful of these systems, and the first to operate on a large scale, is M-Pesa, a joint venture between mobile phone giant Vodafone and Kenya's Safaricom. The M stands for mobile, and Pesa is Swahili for money. Over 50% of the adult population use the service to send money to far-flung relatives, to pay for shopping, utility bills, or even a night on the tiles and taxi ride home. Try to do this in London, New York or Paris and you'll find yourself with a very upset cab driver. Coca Cola experimented with vending machines that let you pay by text message in Finland as early as 1997, however until recently mobile payments were largely limited to the online environment in the developed world. And they would normally require either a credit card, bank or PayPal account. So can the developing world teach us a thing or two about the mobile wallet? ""The bank in my phone"" To use the service, customers first register with Safaricom at an M-Pesa outlet, usually a shop, chemist or petrol station. They can then load money onto their phone. The money is sent onto a third party by text message. The recipient takes the phone to their nearest vendor, where they can pick up the cash. For business, the technology has revolutionised cashflow. John Makusi Simiyu's Nairobi shop is the same bright green as the product it sells. His staff at this M-Pesa outlet are busy helping customers send and receive money. The businessman also owns a transport and real estate company. M-Pesa has fundamentally changed the way it works. He pays his crews, and transfers money to customers using the service. When one of his lorries breaks down, he no longer needs to go to the bank, and then travel miles by bus to reach the stricken vehicle. ""Today I don't need to do that. Just call me, tell me your problem and how much you need and I will text it through M-Pesa system."" ""I don't need to go the bank when I have the bank in my phone"" One of the other great benefits is increased security. Mr Makusi says he no longer has to worry about being mugged while carrying cash. ""The work is done. Security-wise your money is intact, and you have your spare parts."" The success of the technology lies in necessity, according to Seema Desai, director of the Mobile Money for the Unbanked (MMU) programme. In the developed world between 96-98% of people have bank accounts. ""In rural Kenya it is completely different. My bank is hours away and I don't have internet access. But I do have access to a mobile phone. ""Even if you could get to a bank branch you'd need to prove your address with a utility bill. To be very practical about this not everybody in developing markets will pay utility bills, they may not even have a permanent address."" The MMU estimates over 80 similar services globally, with more in the wings. ""It's not just for customers at the end of the chain. We've seen businesses adopt mobile money to offer various business to business services, for example suppliers collecting payments from distributors via the mobile channel."" Helping money move Nick Hughes and Susie Lonie are the people responsible for M-Pesa. The service has been so successful they recently picked up an Economist Innovation award. Ms Lonie says it's been a big hit with small traders. ""They were very quick to pick it up. For example people with market stalls paying for the produce to be delivered by M-Pesa rather than carrying cash. Carrying cash in emerging markets is a very risky thing to do."" ""What it's done is increased the ease at which money can move around, not just individual consumers but small and medium-sized enterprises as well."" says Mr Hughes One of the big problems in the milk industry in Kenya has been how to get payment to the thousands of small one or two-cow milk producers, many of whom are women. A group of them got together and decided to create a payment system using M-Pesa. ""It's a really great example of how people out there in the market place who are struggling to move cash around, are saying we can use this tool to help us smooth our own business challenges."" Although not the first mobile money transfer system in the world - Smart and Globe were active on a smaller scale in the Philippines in 2002 - it is arguably the most successful, with over 13m customers. In March 2010 28.59bn Kenyan Shillings (KES) (£220m, $351m) was transferred using the service. Originally funded in parts by a grant from the UK government, it was supposed to be a microfinance loan repayment system. ""After running the pilot for about nine months we started to see customer behaviour that said actually, this is much more useful as a person to person money transfer system,"" says Mr Hughes ""At that point the lights went on and we realised where the scale opportunity was."" The service has also been launched in Tanzania, Afghanistan and now South Africa, with trials underway in India. Mobile wallet So where does this leave the developed world? Change is happening, although the ways in which we use the mobile wallet in the developed world differ significantly from services like M-Pesa, according to Howard Wilcox of Juniper Research. ""In the developed world mobile payments are made using slightly different technology, so typically we're looking at mobile payments on the web, payments for goods and services onto your bill, or we're looking at premium rate SMS payment."" Mobile payment online is fairly well-established, but what has really pushed the technology mainstream is the success of smart phones. ""We've seen the launch of PayPal's app enabling you to send money from person to person. ""Those sorts of payments are going to be more social payments, sharing the cost of a meal for example, or paying someone a small amount of money you might owe them that by bumping your iPhones together. One company that does let you pay with your mobile is Boku. They provide the mechanism to allow, for example, people to buy virtual money to use in games on social networking sites like Facebook. European managing director James Patmore says they are looking to capitalise on how easy it is to use a mobile phone as a payment mechanism. ""All the consumer needs to have is a mobile phone with either a pre-paid account or post-paid account, and the ability to remember their telephone number."" Users don't have to be registered to use the service, which takes payment from either pay as you go credit or your carrier, with a limit on how much you can spend each day. The company operates in 65 countries, with customers typically spending less than $10 (£6.30) per transaction. Don't touch Near field communication (NFC), a contactless payment technology, is also changing the way we pay for goods in shops. In Japan and South Korea it's been in use for several years, having developed from smart card technology. Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and T-Mobile plan to roll out a mobile payment NFC system called Isis by 2012, and Google's Eric Schmidt says his company's new phone will include an NFC chip. Mobile banking company Monitise is working on a pilot. In the UK, Barclaycard, which already offers contactless payment by credit card are in partnership with Orange to do the same for phones. Overall, it seems the mobile phone becoming ever-more central to our finances, according to Juniper Research's Howard Wilcox. ""We're forecasting that nearly half of all mobile phones users worldwide will use mobile payments by 2014. This could be paying for a digital good like a music track, or it could be physical good which we're seeing increasingly."" So will we see M-Pesa vendors appearing on street corners from Madrid to Montreal? Susie Lonie thinks not. ""We're often asked, would we launch M-Pesa in Europe, and the answer is no, there is not the market need for it."" Orange is the latest entrant to the Kenyan market, and Safaricom has launched M-Kesho, a savings account, in partnership with Equity Bank. A variety of mobile financial services are on offer, and you can even pick up your money from an ATM. Ms Lonie says ""I guess ideally what we're looking for is to take cash out of the economy and replace it with electronic money"". The mobile wallet is here to stay.","Think of the developing world, and the first thing that springs to mind probably isn't cutting edge technology."
"Volkswagen will be fined 17.8bn Korean won ($16m; £12m), in addition to a 14bn won fine from last year, the ministry of environment said. Europe's largest carmaker admitted last year that it had falsified emissions data in its diesel vehicles. The firm has since suffered a global setback in sales and reputation. The sales ban in South Korea affects 32 types of cars - including the VW Golf and Jetta - but a total of 80 models, which include different size engines or trimmings of each type of car. The measures, which affect VW, Audi and Bentley models, come as the result of an extensive probe into the company which saw VW offices in South Korea raided by investigators. South Korea's environment ministry also revoked certification for an additional 83,000 cars, bringing the total number of cars de-certified to more than 200,000. That is about 68% of the 300,000 cars sold by VW in Korea since 2007, Yonhap news agency said. The country is an important market for VW, especially for the firm's luxury brands Bentley and Audi, and the company had more than tripled its sales before it was hit by a slump in the wake of the emissions scandal. Analysis: Steve Evans, South Korea correspondent The South Korean authorities are going for Volkswagen with a vengeance. Not only have they fined the company and banned sales of its brands but prosecutors want to put executives on trial. There may be those who say that the vigour of the Korean response stems partly from the fact that South Korea is one of the world's strongest car-making economies. Korean brands compete bumper-to-bumper with VW's. South Korea itself is not that big a market for VW but tarnishing the rival's brand might help sales in China. All the same, figures out recently showed that VW remains the world's biggest carmaker. Sales were down 7% in the United States in the first six months of the year - but up by the same percentage in China. What is the firm accused of? VW admitted it had installed a cheating software in diesel cars which detects when they are being tested for emissions and then runs the car below normal power to achieve better results. Which countries are affected? It's a global scandal but the problem was first uncovered in the US. The German carmaker said that some 11 million vehicles were affected worldwide. What's VW doing now? The company has launched an internal inquiry and has begun recalling millions of cars worldwide. VW also set aside billions of dollars for fines and compensation costs.",South Korea has suspended sales of 80 Volkswagen models and fined the German carmaker over allegations the firm rigged emissions test data.
"By Max FlintBBC Radio 4, The Report In 2010, the chief executive of BAE Systems, Ian King, was paid over £2.3m, a rise of 8,000%. Yet BAE is making up to 3,000 workers redundant, which under government defence procurement rules, the state will pay for. So is it fair to pay Ian King millions while the taxpayer bears the cost of sacking the workers? Alan Johnson is the MP for Hull West and Hessle where many of the BAE workers live. He says executives are being generously rewarded for making the wrong decisions. ""I think it would be unacceptable even if BAE were making the right decisions. And if you look at their performance they haven't done that. ""They made a decision to get out of civil aviation,"" he adds. ""It was completely the wrong call and workers in this country are suffering as a result of that."" BAE begs to differ. ""Our CEO's pay is performance-based and in 2010 our performance against targets was good,"" it says. ""Pay is set at the right level to enable the company to attract, motivate and retain the highest calibre of executives."" Executive pay used to be 30 or 40 times the wages of the lowest paid worker, now it is more like 300 or 400 times. Rubbing backs In what one could call an arms race for pay, how has executive compensation gone from large via massive to excessive? By committee is the answer. Executive pay in the biggest companies is set by a remuneration committee of non-executive directors. They have been criticised as being a cosy club of like-minded people. At BAE, in common with other companies, the remuneration committee of three non-executive directors votes on the chief executive's annual pay and bonus. And the CEO, in this case Ian King, sits on the committee that decides the non-executive pay levels and bonuses. In effect they decide on each others' pay. Les Wegg is one of the thousands of BAE workers facing redundancy. ""It's a nonsense isn't it? It smacks to me as a bit of a club, if you're going to be genuine about it you need properly independent people,"" he says. BAE Systems say their remuneration committee's ""report last year was highly commended for its transparency"", and that the committee ""seeks independent advice and uses externally validated data"" to set policy. Too much? One of the main tasks of any remuneration committee is to make sure the chief executive does not leave. The wider question of how much is too much is not their problem says remuneration consultant, Vicky Wright. ""Too much in relation to what? We need to recognise that some executives are really producing very, very good results and a lot of good executives create a hell of a lot of value. ""The question for a remuneration committee is have we really got a good chief executive?"" If the committee sets a pay award at 10% and a competitor company sets it at 11%, then next year, to keep their executives happy, the remuneration team might choose to raise pay by 12%. It is a ratchet effect, whatever the company's performance. Alan MacDougal from the Pensions Investment Research Council says that explains why over a 12-year period chief executive pay has quadrupled while share prices have been flat. ""There's a genuine bubble at the heart of our corporate culture. Several thousand people do not exist in the real world like the rest of us. ""Their lifestyles, their leisure, their socialising is not done in the same way as the rest of us. ""It develops a certain arrogance that we've seen displayed in relation to shareholder accountability,"" Mr MacDougal said. Shareholders have the power to vote down executive pay awards at company annual general meetings, but in the last decade there have only been 18 such revolts in the UK. Other priorities With the exception of a minority of investors, most shareholders tend to vote on return on their investment and not on pay and bonuses. As long as share value is increasing, a revolt is unlikely, whatever the level of executive pay. Business Secretary Vince Cable now wants to give shareholders more power to vote down excessive pay deals. His proposals could mean private and institutional investors will only need a 25% vote to defeat a pay deal. At the moment it is 51%. That will make it easier to achieve a majority amongst pension and hedge funds, asset managers and other investors to vote down a pay award. That is a significant change. Take the travel agent Thomas Cook. Former chief executive Manny Fontela-Novoa took the company's share price from 350p to just 50p in four years. He was given a bonus of over £1m when he left. Just three months after his departure the company was forced to borrow £200m to keep trading. Even then only 39% of shareholders voted against the company's pay proposals. Frank Meysman is the new chairman of Thomas Cook. He took over the day after Manny Fontela Novoa left. Mr Meysman says shareholders are the wrong people to control pay, companies like his have to introduce bonus claw-backs and effective performance targets to manage salaries. ""A company should be run by the company. We should look much more at how can we limit the amount of money that somebody can receive when he or she under-performs,"" he told The Report. While more shareholder power might help stop high pay for poor performance, Vince Cable's proposals are less likely to convince shareholders to take on high pay itself.

"Its entire stock of Bitcoins stored on-line, in its so-called ""hot wallet"", were stolen. Coins held in ""cold storage"" or in servers not connected to the internet were not taken. Last week, the world's biggest Bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, filed for bankruptcy protection after it suffered a $500m theft. Bitcoin is a digital or crypto-currency which is bought and sold online, but not backed by any country's central bank or government. Flexcoin called itself the first Bitcoin bank. It provided centralised storage and enabled instant free transfers between Flexcoin customers. It said in a statement: ""On 2 March 2014, Flexcoin was attacked and robbed of all coins in the hot wallet. The attacker made off with 896 [Bitcoins]. ""As Flexcoin does not have the resources, assets, or otherwise to come back from this loss, we are closing our doors immediately. ""Users who put their coins into cold storage will be contacted by Flexcoin and asked to verify their identity. Once identified, cold storage coins will be transferred out free of charge."" Flexcoin and Mt Gox are not the only casualties in Bitcoin's battle with security. On Tuesday, Poloniex, another exchange, also admitted that 12.3% of its reserves had been stolen by hackers. The Slovenia-based Bitstamp had to halt business temporarily after a cyber-attack in February. Hacked The payment processor Inputs.io was hacked in October to the tune of $1m. The Bitcoin market has shrugged off the latest thefts. Since the beginning of March, the value of a Bitcoin has risen from $561 to $668. There are plans by several governments to regulate Bitcoins. A Japanese government spokesman said talks on Bitcoin guidelines were in progress. The Nikkei Business Daily reported on Wednesday that the government would tax Bitcoin transactions and ban banks and securities firms from handling the digital currency. US Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the US Congress should look into legal options for regulating virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. But in the UK, tax authorities published a briefing on the taxing of Bitcoins, dropping plans to charge value added tax (VAT), or sales tax, on Bitcoin trading.","Flexcoin, the Canada-based Bitcoin bank, is to close after losing $600,000 in a hacker attack."
"In the top 100 public companies, women made up 12.6% of executive directors, little changed from last year's 12.2%. Taking into account all 600 companies quoted on the London stock exchange, the figure falls to just 5%. The findings, from headhunters Egon Zehnder, come as the US prepares to introduce boardroom quotas for women and ethnic minorities. The US is finalising the Dodd-Frank Bill, a sweeping range of financial reforms that also contain a provision for firms to meet ratios on gender and race. Section 342 of the Bill, which, if passed on Thursday, could face its final vote on Saturday, requires federal agencies involved in regulating financial institutions to set up a new Office of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI). Each of those offices must try to promote ""racial, ethnic and gender diversity"". Under-represented A UK Treasury Committee report earlier this year highlighted the lack of women in senior positions in the financial services sector. Women make up 44% of employees in the banking, finance and insurance sector, but are significantly under-represented at senior levels throughout the financial services. It stopped short of saying more women on boards would have lessened the impact of the finance crisis, as some of its witnesses had maintained. But it concluded that ""not wasting a large proportion of talent seems more than sufficient to conclude that increased gender diversity is desirable"". The government this week responded to the Committee's findings, pledging to ensure that talented women were not being denied the opportunity to contribute to business and commercial decision-making. Quotas The UK has so far not proposed quotas to ensure better female representation at boardroom level. But Egon Zehnder's managing partner in London, Andrew Roscoe, said other countries' insistence on affirmative action could have an impact in the UK. ""There may not be enough senior women in other markets to meet quotas and the risk is that a limited pool of female talent in the UK will be targeted, making it harder to achieve a better balance in Britain's boardrooms."" Norway has legislation ensuring women make up at least 40% of company boards. Egon Zehnder said that with other governments across Europe - notably in Spain, France and Germany - also looking at affirmative action to speed the pace of change.","Women remain a minority in UK boardrooms, according to research by a recruitment company."
"Net profit for the three months to the end of March was $23m (£14m), compared with an $84m loss a year earlier. Revenue was down 69% at $966m. Cost-cutting and higher profit margins helped the company offset the big drop in revenues. Blackberry is trying to fight back after losing market share. This week, it agreed a deal to license Android applications from Amazon's app store. Excluding a one-off accountancy gain and restructuring charges, the company made an adjusted loss of $60m during the quarter. Gross profit margins were 46.7%, up from 33.9% a year ago. 'On track' Under new boss John Chen, the company has embarked on a turnaround plan aimed at focusing more on its services arm, while putting a renewed emphasis on its keyboard devices. ""Our performance [in the quarter] demonstrates that we are firmly on track to achieve important milestones, including our financial objectives and delivering a strong product portfolio,"" said Mr Chen, who took over the company in November last year. ""Over the past six months, we have focused on improving efficiency in all aspects of our operations to drive cost reductions and margin improvement. Looking forward, we are focusing on our growth plan to enable our return to profitability."" 'Still relevant' Analysts were pleasantly surprised by the latest results. ""The numbers certainly aren't great, but they could have been much worse,"" said investment research firm Morningstar's Brian Colello. Colin Gillis at BGC Partners said the new boss was doing all the right things. ""He's right-sizing the business to fit demand, focusing on the areas where [the company] is still relevant. He's cut partnerships to shore up weaknesses,"" he said. ""If they can get this business where they are selling a million phones a month, they'll be a nice little niche. It will be a nice little profitable business."" The company sold 2.6 million smartphones during the first three months of this year.",Shares in Blackberry closed up 9.6% on Wall Street after the troubled smartphone maker reported a surprise profit.
"Under the deal, all the group's retail customers will be moved to Virgin Money over the next three years. It will be the UK's sixth-largest bank, with about six million customers, but 1,500 jobs are likely to go. CYBG said it had agreed with Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group to license the Virgin Money brand for £12m a year, rising to £15m later. Virgin Group is Virgin Money's biggest shareholder with a 34.8% stake in the business. Don't bank on it: why we fail to switch our accounts Under the terms of the deal, Virgin Money shareholders will get 1.2125 new CYBG shares for every Virgin Money share they hold, and will end up owning about 38% of the combined business. CYBG said the combined group would have about 9,500 employees, but it intended to reduce that total by about a sixth, suggesting about 1,500 jobs would go. It said some of those job losses would be achieved through ""natural attrition"" as there was little overlap in customer-facing roles. The Unite union expressed ""deep unease"" at the prospect of the takeover, adding it was ""vital that the skilled and experienced workforce are given assurances that branches and contact centres will not be closed"". Virgin Money, which was founded in 1995, expanded its business in 2011 when it bought the remnants of Northern Rock for about £747m. Analysis: Kevin Peachey, BBC personal finance reporter Nimbleness and the ability to attract customers through new technology have been seen as challenger banks' main attributes. That is why the Open Banking scheme - opening traditional accounts to specialist services from smaller players - appeared to be a potential game changer for fintechs and banking upstarts. But the TSB fiasco may well have damaged consumer confidence in these companies being able to provide more customer-friendly tech than the big banks. With this deal, the focus shifts to a more traditional form of competition - growing a business to a sufficient size to take on the incumbents at their own game. CYBG said the takeover would ""bring together the complementary strengths of two successful challenger banks to create the UK's first true national competitor to the large incumbent banks"". Its chief executive, David Duffy, told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We're going to become a competitor of scale."" He added that ""technology and agility"" were the factors that would decide the future of banking. ""I think we have sufficient scale - the brands, the product and the technology,"" he said. ""We can be agile enough to deliver a much better deal for the customer."" Mr Duffy will retain his current position in the combined group, as will CYBG chairman Jim Pettigrew. Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia has agreed in principle to stay on as a consultant for a limited time after the deal goes through. The newly enlarged bank will be headquartered in Glasgow.","The owner of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, CYBG, has agreed to buy Virgin Money for £1.7bn."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter Until now, advance fares have generally only been available up until midnight on the day before. Eight train operators are offering the service, claiming that the cheaper tickets can be bought as little as 10 minutes before the train leaves. But advance fares are for a limited number of seats and often sell out. When they are available, they can offer substantial savings. For example, a single fare on the 10:03 from London to Birmingham for 5 July would have cost £52 if bought online on the day of travel. The same fare bought eight weeks in advance currently costs just £11. Advance tickets can potentially be bought on the day with CrossCounty, Grand Central, Greater Anglia, Northern, Transpennine Express, Virgin Trains East Coast, Virgin West Coast and Caledonian Sleeper. They are not being offered on Arriva Trains Wales, South West Trains, Southern, Southeastern, ScotRail or First Great Western. Customers of all long-distance services can now see online how many fares are left at cheaper prices. Last year 27% of all long-distance rail fares were bought as advance tickets. They can be purchased either online or at ticket offices.","Millions of rail passengers can now buy cheaper ""advance"" tickets on the day of departure, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has announced."
"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News Globally, military spending grew just 1.3% in 2010 - a notable slowdown compared with the previous decade. This was partially a result of a ""delayed effect of the global economic crisis"", Sipri said. Spending rose by 5.8% in South America, 5.2% in Africa and 4.1% in Oceania. In Europe, military spending fell by 2.8%, data in the Sipri yearbook revealed. The US remains the world's largest spender on the military arena, accounting for 43% of the global total of $1,630bn (£995bn) 'Upward trend' The Sipri yearbook also highlighted how the world's 10 largest defence and security companies gained the most from military spending. Seven of the 10 firms were based in the US, one in the UK, one in Italy, and one was trans-European. These companies sold arms worth between $11bn and $34bn each during 2009, according to the most recent data. ""Arms producers and military services companies continued their upward trend in arms sales,"" Sipri's Susan T. Jackson observed in the yearbook. The world's largest 100 defence and security companies, as per Sipri's ranking, clocked up sales of more than $400bn last year.","Military spending by major developing countries grew faster than the global average last year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri)."
"Liverpool venues, which are in the strictest ""tier 3"" zone, have been instructed to close from Wednesday. Kate Stewart, who runs The Sandon pub next to Liverpool FC, said: ""The amount of uncertainly is just crippling. ""I've got women who are working for me who are coming in and actually sobbing to me because they don't know whether they are going to have a job."" Mrs Stewart told the BBC she wasn't sure whether to open at all: ""Is it going to be worth me even opening the doors because people are going to be so scared and so worried they probably aren't going to come out anyway? ""The amount of uncertainly and unknowing is just crippling, and it's crippling people's mental health as well."" 'Worst of both worlds' Industry body UK Hospitality (UKH) said that many were already ""reaching the point of no return"". New rules announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday divided the country into three zones. Venues in ""tier 3"" will receive financial support. Those in the ""tier 2"" areas, including large parts of the North and Midlands, will lose custom, with households no longer allowed to mix indoors. And these businesses would experience ""the worst of both worlds"", not being eligible for the extra assistance outlined last week, the industry group said. Nick MacKenzie, chief executive of the Greene King pub chain, which has about 2,700 pubs across the country, told the BBC his employees were working flat out to adjust: ""We are going to do everything we can to get our pubs back open, but it's getting harder and harder. ""We need further support from government for those pubs in tier 2."" He said some of his staff faced losing their homes, as they lived in the pub. UKH has warned a lack of support for hospitality businesses in tiers 1 and 2 could threaten more than half a million jobs. The chief executive of Best Western hotel Group, Rob Paterson, said the ban on households mixing meant his firm was now bracing itself for ""some pretty difficult times"". ""With each restriction, it feels like death by a thousand cuts, because each strikes at the confidence of customers,"" he said. ""Even with a curfew of 10pm and groups of six, bookings haven't happened. We've started to write off a big amount of trade. Work office parties can't have a table of six. It's only going to get worse and worse. We've written off Christmas."" The government's new three-tier system of restrictions mean in parts of England worst hit by the coronavirus bars will close, although restaurants may remain open. In ""tier 2"" areas, which include Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham and many other cities, socialising is restricted to members of your own household or bubble. Tier 1 areas continue with lighter restrictions: the rule of six and the 22:00 curfew. ""For those businesses in tier 3 areas, forced to close their doors again, things look bleak, but the support announced last week for closed businesses will hopefully give them the breathing room they need to survive another lockdown,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""There is currently a concerning lack of support on offer for hospitality businesses in tier 2, and to a lesser extent tier 1, despite their facing restrictions that is seeing trade down by between 40% to 60%."" 'Percolating effect' Bars, gyms, casinos, leisure centres and betting shops across Liverpool must close from Wednesday, leaving businesses there ""bewildered, frustrated and angry"", according to Liverpool Chamber of Commerce Chief Executive Paul Cherpeau. But it wasn't only those businesses that will feel the impact, he said. ""Whilst our visitor economy will bear the brunt of these new restrictions, the percolating effect on supply chains is hugely concerning."" Firms from taxi companies to food and beverage suppliers are likely to feel the impact of the new measures. ""Brewery sales have collapsed because of the uncertainty of further restrictions, as pubs fear they will be closed,"" said Ian Fozard, chairman of the Society of Independent Brewers. ""While pubs that are legally closed are being offered financial support, this does not seem to apply to small breweries that will lose more than 80% of their sales."" Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood, which supplies food to a range of outlets from pubs and cinemas to schools and hospitals, said the government had failed to recognise the knock-on impact on firms like his. ""They have supported hospitality and it's warranted, because hospitality is under pressure. What they haven't done is give any support to the supply chain that supports hospitality, education and healthcare. We've had no direct grants, no business rates relief, no rent assistance.""",Bars and restaurants across much of England are working out how to operate amid new coronavirus restrictions.
"The Edinburgh-based oil exploration company is contesting the claim. It has has been trying to exit India's oil market, where it made a fortune for shareholders, for over a year. The firm still owns a 10% shareholding in its Indian subsidiary, Cairn India, which the Indian tax authorities insist it retains. Most of the rest of the company was sold to the Indian mining company Vedanta. Retrospective tax law Due to the falling oil price, the value of that stake in Cairn India has fallen from $1bn to £700m (£660m to £465m), and the Edinburgh firm intends to claim for that loss. Cairn Energy hit an oil prospecting jackpot in Thar desert in Rajasthan in 2004. It was to be India's biggest oil field. Having sold most of the subsidiary, the company has distributed much of the profit to shareholders, while retaining some for new exploration, in Greenland, the North Sea and off the west African coast. The Scottish firm had thought it was resolving the dispute over tax, having contested the use of a retrospective tax law introduced by the Delhi government. But on Monday, just after releasing its annual financial results, the company received the tax bill for $1.6bn plus interest and penalties. It covers the tax year 2006-07, when it was preparing to float Cairn India on the Mumbai stock exchange. Since first hearing of the claim 14 months ago, Cairn said it has confirmed, through its advisers, that it has been ""compliant with India's tax legislation in force in each year"". Its response to the new tax bill is to lodge a Notice of Dispute under the terms of the UK-India trade treaty, saying it has detailed legal advice on the strength of its case under international law. The Indian government and Cairn are now required to negotiate to seek a resolution to the dispute. If there is no agreement, an international arbitration panel will adjudicate. Simon Thomson, chief executive of Cairn Energy, said the new bill is ""very disappointing"" after regular engagement with the Indian government over the past 14 months. ""Cairn has consistently confirmed that it has been fully compliant with all relevant legislation and paid all applicable taxes in India and we are confident of our position under the UK-India Investment Treaty,"" he added. New wells He also raised wider concerns about the Indian government's treatment of foreign investors in the country, implying that this case will damage the country's interests. ""Since the election of the BJP, senior government ministers have consistently commented on the negative impact the issue of retrospective taxation has had on international reputation and investor sentiment towards India,"" said Mr Thompson. The heightening of the dispute came hours after the annual results showed Cairn's loss last year fell to £252m - less than the previous year. In its annual results, it announced plans to drill at least three new wells in Senegal, West Africa, this year. The exploration firm has no revenue because its focus is exploration work. However, it reports a cash balance of £576m, which analysts said puts it in a solid financial position ahead of expected first sales in two years' time.

"By Bill WilsonBusiness reporter, BBC News They say the figure has been hit just four years after passing £2bn, and that revenues have doubled in seven years. ""A remarkable achievement in isolation, but phenomenal in the wider economic context of that same period,"" said Dan Jones, head of Deloitte's sports team. He said the battle between TV firms for Premier League rights was key to driving the league's revenues higher. ""The entry of BT Sport into the market to compete with BSkyB has applied huge upward pressure to broadcast revenue - from the 2013-14 season onwards each domestic live game on average generates broadcast revenue of £6.5m,"" said Mr Jones, in Deloitte's Annual Review of Football Finance. ""It is clear that BT Sport's entry is not a passing fad but a serious, focused, long-term commitment."" In 2013-14 top flight clubs benefitted, on average, from an extra £25m in broadcast revenue. 'Razor thin' margins While providing a snapshot of the 2013-14 season, the Deloitte report looks at the 2012-13 season in greater depth. There were positive signs in the Premier League, with revenues rising to £2.5bn for the first time, but the perennial issues of high wages and debts remained. Premier League operating profits decreased slightly, and Deloitte said clubs were operating on ""razor thin"" margins. Wage costs as a percentage of revenues hit a new high of 71%. Clubs' aggregate net debt grew by £139m to a total of more than £2.5bn by summer 2013. Deloitte says this was largely driven by an increase in interest-free ""soft loans"" from owners of £228m. In fact soft loans totalled £1.6bn, up from £1.4bn a year earlier, represented close to two-thirds of total net debt. Some 90% of this figure was attributable to four Premier League clubs - Chelsea, Newcastle United, Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers, However, Deloitte expects Uefa's Financial Fair Play break-even requirements - which saw Manchester City punished last month for breaching the rules - to focus clubs' minds on balancing their books. ""The signs are that most clubs are adopting a more financially robust and balanced approach to the way they run their businesses, and they must continue down this path if they are to safeguard the long term financial health of the game,"" Mr Jones said. 'Global perspective' Meanwhile, the growing global appeal of the English Premier League could be seen in the fact that during 2012-13 half of the clubs had foreign owners, compared with only one 10 years earlier. International owners have ""also influenced the increasingly global commercial perspective driving clubs' business plans, as well as helping the overall export of the Premier League brand around the globe"", say Deloitte. It says it is only a matter of time before there is an owner or major sponsorship deal from China, where the Premier League is a major consumer brand. The drive to achieve promotion to the Premier League saw Championship clubs gamble heavily in 2012-13. Wage costs exceeded revenues in the Championship for the first time in 12 years, leading to a record wage-to-revenue ratio of 106% and record operating losses of £241m. Big clubs dominate Looking more broadly at the ""Big Five"" European leagues - England, Germany, Italy, France and Spain - revenues grew 5% to 9.8bn euros. That represented almost half of the overall size of the European football market of 19.9bn euros. Much of the growth was at a limited number of big clubs, such as Juventus. In Italy, revenues grew by 97m euros in 2012-13, three quarters of which was down to Juventus. Broadcast revenue continued to be the key source of income for Italian clubs, contributing 59% of their total revenues. Germany's Bundesliga continued to be the only big five league where income from TV rights was not the largest revenue source. Instead, commercial revenue, which accounted for 46% of the total, dominated. The Bundesliga also remained the league with the strongest cost control, with a wages-to-revenue ratio of 51%. In Scotland, generated by top tier clubs fell by £4m in 2012-13. The impact of Rangers competing outside the top flight was largely offset by additional revenues generated by Celtic's run to the last 16 of the Champions League.","Premier League clubs' revenues broke the £3bn mark in the recent 2013-14 season, say analysts at Deloitte."
"Kantar Worldpanel said that the value of sales fell by 0.2% for the 12 weeks to 9 November compared with the same period last year. That was the first decline since the market research company began tracking the industry in 1994. Price competition has pushed down grocery prices by 0.4%. Price war Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, said the fight to attract customers had sparked a price war that meant the average basket of staple goods now cost less than it did last November. The fall in grocery inflation was another record low since Kantar began tracking prices in October 2006. ""This is bad news for retailers, but good news for shoppers with price deflation forecast to continue well into 2015,"" Mr McKevitt said. The fall reflected the impact of discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as lower prices of staples such as vegetables, milk and bread. In a separate report, investment bank Goldman Sachs said that Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Tesco were ""totally addicted to space"". If they want to return to profitable growth they need to cut their selling space by 20%, which could involve closing some stores altogether, according to Goldman. It says that Tesco, with the largest amount of store space and the biggest stores, would benefit the most from cutting back. Discount challenge The Kantar report showed that for the 12 weeks to 9 November, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons continued to suffer from falling sales. Kantar said that Asda's sales were down 0.2% from a year earlier, while its market share remained steady at 17.2%. Sales at Sainsbury's were down by 2.5%, with a market share 0.4 percentage points lower at 16.4%. Morrisons' sales fell 3.3% compared with the same period last year, and its market share was 11.1%, down from 11.5%. Tesco recorded the worst sales slide, down 3.7%, with a 1.1 percentage point fall in market share to 28.7%. In contrast, Aldi sales have jumped by more than 25% from a year earlier - slightly less stellar than the 32% growth recorded in the 12 weeks to 20 July. It now has a record market share of 4.9%. Lidl also did well, with its market share hitting 3.5% following a 16.8% rise in sales - also slightly lower growth than the previous three months. Waitrose had another good result, with a 5.6% rise in sales and a 5.1% market share, up from 4.8% in the same period last year.","UK grocery sales have fallen for the first time in two decades, a survey suggests, underlining the challenge faced by supermarkets."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said that prices rose by 0.1% in June to August compared with the previous three months. Few properties are changing hands with the political and economic situation leading people to stay put. However, the lender said the market was still ""resilient"" amid the uncertainty. It estimated the price of the average UK home is now £233,541. The Halifax said that average UK house prices rose by 0.3% in August compared with July, with prices now 1.8% higher than they were a year ago. The annual change has accelerated slightly compared with recent months. Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax, said that prices had effectively been flat since March. Caution among buyers and sellers had put the brakes on price rises despite strong employment and relatively affordable mortgages. ""Although the housing market will undoubtedly be influenced by events in the wider economy, it continues to show a degree of resilience for the time being,"" he said. ""We should also not lose sight of the fact that the single biggest driver of both prices and activity over the longer-term remains the dearth of available properties to meet demand from buyers."" Sales falling There were 86,630 home sales in July, according to the latest figures from HM Revenue and Customs, which was a 12% fall on the same month a year earlier. ""Brexit has slammed the door on the property market's fingers, leaving a crack through which only modest price growth can be achieved,"" said Lucy Pendleton, director of estate agents James Pendleton. The Halifax survey is based on its own mortgage lending data, and the methodology has just been updated for the first time in more than 30 years to reflect the modern housing stock. It also creates a UK average which might not be reflected regionally, with some areas seeing steady house price growth while others see property values falling. Where can you afford to live?

"Mr Bailey is the former boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). He has been criticised by Dame Elizabeth Gloster for his role at the FCA in regulating London Capital & Finance, which collapsed in 2019. Mr Bailey said responsibility and culpability were not the same thing. Before becoming governor, Andrew Bailey was chief executive of the FCA, which was criticised in a report by Dame Elizabeth for failing to supervise and regulate LCF. Her report named Mr Bailey as responsible for that failure and said he had made legal representations to prevent responsibility for the FCA's failings being attributed to him by name. Before the Treasury committee of MPs last month, Mr Bailey said he was ""angry"" and ""disturbed"" by her criticisms, adding it was ""not correct"" to say he did not want his name mentioned in the context of personal responsibility and that his apology for the failure had been misrepresented. That prompted Dame Elizabeth to write to the committee releasing extracts of representations from Mr Bailey's legal team, revealing that they had asked for him not to be named on a number of different grounds. Savers suffered More than 11,000 savers lost money in investing £238m in LCF, which went bust in 2019. BBC Radio 4 Today programme host Martha Kearney asked Mr Bailey about LCF during a wide-ranging interview. He replied: ""I never said that I was not responsible for everything that went on at the FCA. That was my role as CEO. ""The particular issue… was that the first draft of the report introduced responsibility and culpability together in an inseparable way and they're not the same thing."" Separately, Mr Bailey has come under new criticism following a report that he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in a scandal that saw thousands of bank customers mistreated. The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) was accused of benefiting as it left some of its customers in financial ruin. Now it is reported that Mr Bailey did not reveal his role in the scandal. The Bank of England said there was no interest to declare. 'New tools' During the same BBC Today interview, Mr Bailey said he was ""not out of firepower"" in defending the UK economy as it recovers from the pandemic. He said he was looking at ""new tools"" to deal with the UK's biggest economic shock in 300 years. These could include negative interest rates, but ""that's not a view on whether we will use them or not"". ""The economy will actually get back at the end of this year to where it was at the end of 2019,"" he said. However, that was ""not much more than getting back to where we were pre-Covid"". Mr Bailey said the Bank expected inflation to start rising towards its 2% target in ""the next two or three months"". But he added that the Bank's rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee would need to see ""a lot more evidence"" that the inflationary trend was sustainable before acting, given the ""huge uncertainty"" over the economic effects of Covid. ""We are not out of tools, we are not out of firepower,"" Mr Bailey said. Although he did not commit one way or the other on the use of negative interest rates, he said it was ""appropriate to have that tool in the box"". The Bank governor's comments follow months of public speculation about the possibility of negative rates, with several former and current Bank policymakers weighing in with their views. At the same time, other commentators have been warning that the economy could overheat as the end of lockdown unleashes pent-up consumer demand, with a surge in inflation as a result. Mr Bailey said he had seen ""no evidence"" to support fears that inflation could hit 4% or 5% as the recovery gathered pace. He said the UK's vaccination campaign had been ""a great achievement"" and he was now ""more positive"" about the recovery, but he wanted to add ""a large dose of caution"". Mr Bailey warned that new variants of the virus could still pose a risk to the recovery. He also said the economic effects of the pandemic had been ""very unequal"". ""Covid has affected the low-paid more. There are more women in that section of the labour force,"" he said. Ethnic minorities were also disproportionately affected, he added. But he said it was ""very helpful"" that the furlough scheme was now projected to extend beyond the lifting of Covid restrictions, which should ""help to smooth that transition"".",Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has defended himself after a former appeal court judge criticised evidence he gave to MPs over a scandal in which thousands lost their life savings.
"By Ian PollockPersonal finance reporter, BBC News People will also be able to find out from HM Revenue and Customs if their partners receive child benefit, or earn above £50,000 a year. The changes are part of the forthcoming taxation of child benefit in households where someone earns above £50,000. Experts say the changes will breach key tax confidentiality principles. ""This is a chip away at independent taxation and taxpayer confidentiality, because there is no other way of going about it,"" said John Whiting, of the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT). Chas Roy-Chowdhury of the ACCA accountancy body said: ""I think the Treasury have devised a bad tax that HMRC are having to implement. ""It is a bad idea to tax an individual who is not receiving the benefit."" Checking each other The new tax starts on 7 January 2013 and will affect 1.2 million families. It is going to be levied on those in a household whose ""adjusted net income"" is more than £50,000 a year and who claim, or whose partner claims, child benefit. HMRC says it will ""expect"" couples to discuss their tax and benefits with each other, to find out if the higher earner is liable for the tax, despite the policy of separate taxation of married couples being in place since 1991. HMRC will also let taxpayers ask for rudimentary information from its records to see whether or not their partners receive child benefit, or have an ""adjusted net income"" above £50,000, and should be paying the new tax. This runs counter to the general principle of taxpayer confidentiality, which has been a formal part of the income tax system since 1803. Revealing someone's tax records is currently a criminal offence for HMRC officials. The relaxation of the two principles is going to happen because otherwise high earners who should pay the tax would be able to claim they were unable to find out if their partner received child benefit, and vice versa. ""In stable relationships you can see this carrying along smoothly,"" John Whiting said. ""But what about relationships that break up during the year? ""There are so many practical questions [about how the new tax will operate],"" he added. 'Best of a bad job' Responsibility for paying the tax will lie with the high earner in the household. HMRC also administers the child benefit system, which pays out to nearly 7.9 million families, with 13.7 million children. So the Revenue could cross-check its list of high earners with its list of child benefit recipients, to see where they coincide. But it hopes that taxpayers who have to pay the tax will save it the trouble and identify themselves when they are sent forms, as part of an enlarged self-assessment tax system next year. An HMRC spokeswoman explained how the Revenue expected the new arrangements to work. ""HMRC would expect couples to discuss their tax or benefit details with each other,"" she said. ""However, for taxpayers unable to discuss their financial affairs, we will develop a process with appropriate security checks so HMRC can provide 'yes/no' answers to simple questions about whether child benefit is paid to the taxpayer's partner or about the level of a partner's income,"" she added. Despite the implications of the emerging policy, HMRC said: ""We are committed to protecting the principle of individual taxation and confidentiality. These principles will be at the centre of our child benefit compliance procedures."" Chas Roy-Chowdhury said: ""It is making the best of a bad job. ""The person paying has to comply with the system so there has to be a way they can get the information."" £700m saving Currently, a parent can claim £20.20 a week in child benefit for their eldest or only child, and £13.40 for each subsequent child. The money is not taxed and the system is geared towards paying the mother. The payments apply to all children aged under 16 and in some cases until they are 20 years old. The policy of withholding child benefit from families where there is a high earner was first suggested by the coalition government in 2010. In this year's Budget the plan was refined so that it would not apply, as first suggested, to all those who pay 40% income tax on any of their incomes. Instead, the tax will apply gradually at £50,000 of income, with the child benefit being eroded completely once someone's income is £60,000 or more. It is expected to save the government nearly £700m a year. If the high earner is also the person claiming child benefit for their children then they can simply stop claiming it in order to avoid the tax charge. But if a parent with a high-earning partner claims the benefit, their partner will have no power to tell them to stop claiming it so the new charge can be avoided. Penalties The government estimates that 1.2 million families receiving child benefit will have to pay the new tax; 70% will lose all their benefit and the remaining 30% will lose just a portion. The affected families are expected to lose £1,300 a year on average. The Revenue said that if it suspected that individuals were not paying the new tax charge when they should, it would be able to cross-check its income tax records with its child benefits records. ""HMRC will apply existing risk assessment techniques to identify where, for example, income has been understated or the liability has not been reported,"" said the Revenue spokeswoman. ""Existing penalties will apply to non-compliant taxpayers,"" she pointed out. That means fines or possible prosecution.",New child benefit rules mean that some high earners and their partners will be expected to disclose their finances to each other from next January.
"By Ian PollockPersonal finance reporter, BBC News These are policies which promise to pay out a supposedly fixed sum to the policy holder's inheritors when the customer eventually dies, with the payment coming from the investment proceeds of the person's monthly premiums. Some people have been aggrieved to find that many years down the line, the bank or insurer that originally sold them their policy has decided that things have changed. Either the customer must pay more by way of monthly premiums or must accept that the eventual payout will be significantly lower than first thought. The typical explanation is that investment returns have been much poorer than first anticipated many years ago, when the policies were first sold. The main reason for the rising number of complaints - to banks, insurers and then the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) - is that the possibility of this sort of change was sometimes not made clear in the first place. Yoga Kissoon, a semi-retired maths teacher from Norwood in South London, has had exactly this experience and has been pursuing a complaint with Barclays bank. Her husband had taken out a whole-of-life policy in 1984 and she took out another one in 1990. ""We were looking for a policy where the sum assured stayed the same, and the premiums stayed the same, "" Yoga explains. ""When we took it out we were on a tight budget. They assured us that the premium would stay the same throughout our life and the sum assured would stay the same. ""The problem is, exactly 20 years later for each of us, Barclays bank wrote to us saying that if we don't increase our premiums they will reduce our sum assured."" Policy value cut In 2004 Yoga's husband, Mahesh, suffered a cut in the payout value of his life insurance from £30,000 to just under £25,000, and then in 2009 to £20,600, rather than pay more. Telephone complaints to Barclays about this process got nowhere. But when Yoga's policy suffered a similar cut in its payout value in 2010, to just under £24,000, she took up her complaint more vigorously with Barclays. She failed to convince the bank that it had been guilty of some sort of mis-selling. Barclays pointed out - accurately - that the possibility of a regular review of her policy, with attendant cuts in insurance value or increases in premiums, was referred to in the marketing brochure it supplied. The brochure said: ""In the event that the return is less than expected, existing cover can be maintained by increasing the premium. Alternatively the amount of cover can be reduced."" Crucially, the bank also refused to accept Yoga's claim that separate payment schedules had given the impression of permanently fixed payments. Nor did it accept her assertion that when a Barclays salesman from the local branch had gone to her house to sell the policy, he had said that the premiums and payouts were guaranteed to stay fixed, as she wanted. Unfortunately for Yoga, she waited too long before trying to take the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS). She waited more than six months and is now out of time. However her original problem is not uncommon. The number of complaints about these policies that went to the FOS rose by 26% in the last financial year, to 1,828. Fresh surge The most common complaint was that it had not made clear at the point of sale that the policies could be reviewed at regular intervals, with premiums rising or benefits being cut. ""The review process has started to bite in lots of the policies that were sold 10, 15 or more years ago,"" said Tony Boorman, deputy chief executive of the FOS. ""[Our decisions] are usually about what we think really happened all those years ago when the policy was sold. ""Was it really made clear in the documentation to the customers, in the key facts, that this review could take place?"" he said. Now there has been a fresh surge of complaints to the FOS. There were 1,187 in the first six months of the current financial year, though this was partly due to claims management firms drumming up speculative complaints on behalf of their customers. In the end, only about a third of the whole-of-life complaints taken to the FOS in 2011-12 were upheld. That was a much lower uphold rate than for many other types of complaint. And among the more recent cases the uphold rate has dropped to just 23%. The total number of whole-of-life insurance complaints is nowhere near as many as those about payment protection insurance (PPI), which have now reached half a million since they first started coming in a few years ago. But Tony Boorman told the BBC that his organisation was keeping a close on eye on how they develop. ""It is not a red-flag problem but it is on the one-to-watch list,"" he said.","An increasing number of people have been complaining about the apparent mis-selling of ""whole-of-life"" insurance policies."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter The Switch Guarantee service was launched exactly three years ago, but the numbers using it have fallen consistently. In the year to the end of June 2016, the number of switches averaged 88,031 a month. That compares with a monthly average of 92,448 in the previous year. Most account holders have steadfastly refused to move, despite incentives worth up to £220 being offered by banks and building societies. Bacs, the organisation responsible for the switching service, will launch the new advertising campaign in newspapers, social media and online this weekend. New entrants The adverts will feature a man reading a newspaper with a headline claiming that more than three million people have moved account since September 2013. Official figures show there have been 3.2 million switches over the period, including those who have moved more than once. There are as many as 68 million current accounts in the UK. There will also be a new website to show people how to switch within seven days. As part of its recent inquiry into current accounts, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) required that there should be a publicity campaign to persuade more people to move their accounts. The government has been keen to encourage greater switching levels, to encourage new entrants into the banking market.",A new advertising campaign is being launched to persuade more people to switch bank accounts - because not enough people are doing so.
"Chinese authorities said Google must keep its mobile software, Android, free for other device makers for up to five years. The acquisition is Google's biggest to date. The internet search giant has also named a new management team for the phone handset maker. Motorola is a leading manufacturer of smartphones and other devices. Google's takeover of the business allows it to move into the manufacturing of phones and tablet computers for the first time. History Google's chief executive, Larry Page, said in a blog post that there were people using devices now who may never use a desktop machine: ""The phones in our pockets have become supercomputers that are changing the way we live. It's now possible to do things we used to think were magic, or only possible on Star Trek- like get directions right from where we are standing; watch a video on YouTube; or take a picture and share the moment instantly with friends."" He added that Motorola had a long history in technological development: ""Motorola is a great American tech company that has driven the mobile revolution, with a track record of over 80 years of innovation, including the creation of the first cell phone."" He said he saw the new business producing ""the next generation of mobile devices that will improve lives for years to come"". The purchase gives Google access to more than 17,000 of the company's valuable patents. The Chinese authorities cleared the deal on condition that Google keeps its mobile software, Android, free for other device makers for up to five years. The European Commission also approved the deal, but it did not conclude there was an issue with Android, saying it was unlikely that Google would restrict the use of Android solely to Motorola, which is a minor player in the European Economic Area. US approval has also been granted.",Google's $12.5bn (£7.9bn) purchase of US phone maker Motorola Mobility has been completed days after it received approval from the Chinese government.
"Some 305 of Primark's 389 global stores are shut - including all 190 UK outlets - but unlike rivals it has no online arm to fall back on. Customers have said they would welcome the retailer setting up an online shop. But Primark, which saw a 30% sales fall to £2bn in the 16 weeks to 2 January, says the cost would mean price rises. It contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020. On Thursday, consumers called on Primark to embrace e-commerce with one tweeting: ""Online sales are thru the roof during the pandemic. You're missing out on a LOT of money."" But the retailer tweeted back: ""We prefer to sell our products in our physical stores but thanks for the suggestion."" Since March last year, non-essential shops in the UK and overseas have faced strict curbs and prolonged closures and all are currently shut in England. In a statement, Primark said that if all of its stores stayed closed until 27 February 2021, it expected to miss out on £1.05bn of sales - up from a previous estimate of £650m. The retailer said it would partially mitigate this by cutting its costs, but did not say if that would mean job losses. It added that it only expected to break even in the first half of the financial year, after seeing healthy operating profits of £441m last time around. Why won't Primark sell online? In the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices. ""As a fast fashion retailer they are on a low margins anyway - they have to be very competitive on price,"" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC. He said pure online players like Asos and Boohoo could make it work because they were ""geared up for it in terms of logistics"". ""But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly."" Can the retailer survive offline? Despite this Mr O'Brien said the retailer was still likely succeed, pointing to the surge in sales it saw when its shops reopened after the first lockdown. But Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of ""potentially alienating its customers"" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. ""They have very loyal customers who love the brand, but they are crying out to be able to access it online. ""The longer they are not online, the more disruptive it is. The more their customers are discovering new brands and ways to shop."" Associated British Foods also owns food and agriculture businesses. Sales across the group were down 13% in the 16 weeks to 2 January at £4.8bn. The changing online dial There are always winners and losers in retail but this Christmas the picture is more polarised than ever thanks to the effects of the pandemic. Just contrast the fortunes of Primark, which doesn't sell online, with Boohoo and Asos which have both reported soaring growth in sales. All our big supermarkets have now reported bumper Christmas trading, too, which is no real surprise given we can't go out to eat and so many of us are working from home. This growth has also been driven by an extraordinary rise in internet orders. While Primark is bracing itself to lose £1bn in business as a result of store closures, Tesco says it added £1bn of extra sales online this festive quarter. It's been very tough for many traditional non-food retailers, big and small, who've been unable to make up for all the lost sales from their High Street shops. Looking ahead, the big question is where the online dial will settle when our lives eventually return to normal.",Primark says it has no plans to sell its clothes online despite warning that lockdown store closures could cost it more than £1bn in lost sales.
"By Nick Garnett and Helen ThomasBBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live has been speaking to people in Buckshaw Village, near Chorley in Lancashire. It's a place that didn't exist 20 years ago, but which relies on Northern. Buckshaw was built on land which was formerly one of Britain's largest munitions sites, Chorley's Royal Ordnance Factory. More than 4,000 people now live there, and many of its residents commute into Preston and Manchester during the day. The village was designed to be sustainable, and cycle lanes and public transport were integrated into the building plans. A new train station, Buckshaw Parkway, opened in 2011. 'Negative mood' Ian Smith, 47, is a civil servant who lives in Buckshaw Village. He takes the early train every morning to Manchester Victoria. Ian says he loves Buckshaw and its ""fantastic facilities"", but says the train service into Manchester is ""lacking"". ""We're running old trains,"" he says, ""and for the money that you pay for a ticket to go to Manchester, I think the actual service is atrocious."" For Ian, the main issue is the late running of trains, which delays him arriving at work. He says the information on platforms and apps is incorrect. ""It puts you in a negative mood before you start your day,"" he says. Stacey Worthington lives in nearby Chorley, but commutes out of Buckshaw Village to Manchester where she works in banking. She takes the early train to avoid the rush hour and allow herself to get back in time to pick her children up from school. ""The past two years have not been great,"" she says, ""I get a half six train and you just turn up and it's cancelled. Next one's 10 past seven so immediately then I'm 40 minutes late for work."" ""It's been better recently with newer trains and more carriages."" Stacey has a young family and says having to make up the time at work is tricky: ""If the train's late or it's cancelled, I'm knackered. So I've got to then start trying to get after-school care, which instantly costs me £20."" ""I'm paying £1,900 a year for a season ticket from Buckshaw to Manchester. You might get a seat, you might not. You might get a train, you might not."" Alexandra Evans, 38, lives in Buckshaw and is the regional manager for an international telecoms company. She travels a lot with work and her husband works locally - primarily for childcare reasons as Alexandra never knows if her train will get her back in time. She estimates about 90% of journeys she takes are delayed. ""You have the anxiety of getting to the train station, finding a car parking space, finding a seat… and then walking into the station. ""I'll be honest the first thing I do in the morning is walk to the board to see if my train is actually on time. ""They don't understand the impact on somebody's work day and the stress that's caused before you even start work."" 'Massive effect' Paula Murray, 34, is the manager of the village nursery. She lives nearby but has to be on hand to stay late if any parents are delayed getting home. The nursery opens early to allow people to get to work but it's pick-up that's a problem, because people often don't have family living nearby. She said: ""Last night when someone was late, we just stayed as long as we needed to really... it can have a massive effect. ""We've had [staff] in the years before who've missed driving lessons, meals with family."" Paula is a mum herself and nearly missed a parents' evening because another parent was late picking up their child: ""It can have a massive, massive knock-on effect."" For Sam Holt, 44, there's a ""feeling of dread"" about his commute from Buckshaw Village. He runs a music and DJ management company and goes in to Manchester three times a week. ""It's a nightmare,"" he says, ""You can't rely on the information."" Sam says when a train arrives on time ""there's almost a collective clapping on the platform because it's like, hey, it got here!"" He says he now sometimes allows an hour extra to get home, ""that's a decent chunk of your day if you add that up across a working year. That's a lot of time"". The unreliability has a knock-on effect for business owners. John Quinton-Barber, 49, owns a PR agency in Manchester city centre with about 30 staff. He's put everyone on flexitime, allowing his workers to start from home or clock on later in the day, because he couldn't rely on people arriving on time due to the late running trains. He says the policy's been a huge success. ""I don't want my colleagues being worried that their train is delayed and they have to get in a certain time. I see every day a message from one of my colleagues 'I'm going to be 10/15 minutes late, because Northern haven't arrived or because there's issues with the trains.' ""As an employer, we are taking the heat because of our dysfunctional railway."" He feels frustrated having ""to pick up the pieces of a broken Network Rail network in the north"". Congested tracks A Northern spokesperson said: ""Our customers deserve the best possible rail service and we are working hard, alongside our partners, to improve industry performance. ""We have delivered on our commitment to increase the number of train services… and yet there has been no real increase in track capacity since 2016, which has led to more congested railways across the North. Infrastructure issues and the additional congestion have taken their toll on punctuality. ""Arriva and Northern remain fully committed to delivering the transformation of the North's railways and improving customers' experience. ""We are delivering the biggest transformation of local rail for a generation, with 62 of our 101 new trains now in service.

"In the UK, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) plans to investigate the scandal and will require HSBC's former head to give evidence. There have also been calls for action in the US, Belgium, France, Argentina and Switzerland itself. HSBC said it is ""co-operating with relevant authorities"". The BBC learnt that HSBC helped wealthy clients evade hundreds of millions of pounds worth of tax. Panorama has seen accounts from 106,000 clients in 203 countries, leaked by whistleblower Herve Falciani in 2007. In the US a member of the Senate banking committee has asked the government to reveal what it knew about the documents. In Belgium, a judge is considering issuing international arrest warrants for directors of the Swiss division of the bank, while France has launched an investigation and its prime minister has promised more action both at home and at a European level. Swiss politicians are asking for a regulatory investigation. Analysis by Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor This morning, Martin Wheatley, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), appears before the Treasury Select Committee. One question he should be asked by MPs is what the FCA has done and is doing about the HSBC leaked data which shows the bank allowed wealthy customers to evade taxes. Let's not forget, this information has been available to the authorities since 2010. Speaking to the FCA yesterday, it said the main issue was tax - and therefore a matter for HMRC - and that its jurisdiction over Swiss banking was limited. But given the FCA's remit covers banking conduct and that HSBC is headquartered in the UK, it is now important to hear Mr Wheatley's opinions on what has been revealed over the last two days. And, more to the point, what the FCA is going to do about it. The PAC's chairman, Margaret Hodge, said late on Monday: ""The Public Accounts Committee will be launching an urgent inquiry to which we will require HSBC to give evidence - and we will order them if necessary"". The PAC has a routine meeting scheduled on Wednesday at which the head of HMRC, Lin Homer, will appear. Peer pressure One of HSBC's most senior figures, Stephen Green, who was made group chief executive in 2003 before going on to become the group executive chairman of the bank in 2006, was made a minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013. Now Lord Green, he told the BBC's Panorama programme: ""As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present."" But Mrs Hodge said: ""Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. ""Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer."" John Mann, a Labour MP who sits on the Treasury Select Committee, has written to the chairman of the committee, Andrew Tyrie, and asked him to recall Lord Green: ""I've asked for him to be brought in front of the committee so he can put the record straight. If we call him he'll have to come."" Treasury minister David Gauke defended Lord Green's appointment on BBC's Radio 4. ""I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that Lord Green was involved in this sort of activity"", but said he did not know whether anyone asked him about HSBC prior to his government appointment. 'Control failures' HSBC admitted that it was ""accountable for past control failures."" But it said it has now ""fundamentally changed"". ""We acknowledge that the compliance culture and standards of due diligence in HSBC's Swiss private bank, as well as the industry in general, were significantly lower than they are today,"" it added. The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina, but not in the UK, where HSBC is based. HSBC said it is ""co-operating with relevant authorities"". Offshore accounts are not illegal, but many people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. And while tax avoidance is perfectly legal, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is not. The French authorities concluded in 2013 that 99.8% of their citizens on the list were probably evading tax. HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers 106,000 clients with Swiss bank accounts 203 countries involved $118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts 11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn 9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn 7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bn Joint investigation The thousands of pages of data were obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde. In a joint investigation, the documents have now been passed to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian newspaper, Panorama and more than 50 media outlets around the world. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and has identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. One person has been prosecuted. HMRC said £135m in tax, interest and penalties have now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. But Ms Hodge said: ""I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, brave enough, tough enough in securing for the British taxpayer the monies that are due."" In some cases, HSBC broke the law by actively helping its clients. The bank gave one wealthy family a foreign credit card so they could withdraw their undeclared cash at cash dispensers overseas. HSBC also helped clients stay ahead of the law. When the European Savings Directive was introduced in 2005, the idea was that Swiss banks would take any tax owed from undeclared accounts and pass it to the taxman. It was a tax designed to catch tax evaders. But instead of simply collecting the money, HSBC wrote to customers and offered them ways to get round the new tax. HSBC denies that all these account holders were evading tax. Verbal messages Meanwhile, HSBC said it has completely overhauled its private banking business and has reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70% since 2007. In a statement, the bank said: ""HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money."" The bank said it now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability. But Panorama has spoken to a whistleblower who said there were still problems with tax dodging at HSBC private bank when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg. She said HSBC did not keep its promise to change. ""I think the verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice and that disturbed me greatly,"" she said. It was her job to make sure HSBC followed the rules, but she said she was sacked after raising concerns. She has since won a tribunal hearing for unfair dismissal.","Authorities in a range of countries are considering examining HSBC's actions in helping more than 100,000 wealthy individuals avoid paying tax."
"By Ben MorrisBusiness Reporter Bank policymakers voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5% at their latest meeting. However, they said rates would need to rise ""earlier"" and by a ""somewhat greater extent"" than they thought at their last review in November. Economists think the next rate rise could come as soon as May. The value of the pound jumped by about 1% against both the dollar and the euro in reaction to the Bank's comments. Higher interest rates have an important effect on households and the economy. Around 8.1 million UK households have a mortgage, and of those almost half are on either a standard variable rate or a tracker rate. Interest rates on those types of mortgages would be likely to match any increase in official rates made by the Bank of England. But for savers a move higher by the Bank of England could be a bonus, as High Street banks generally have to raise their rates of interest. In November, the Bank raised the cost of borrowing for the first time in more than 10 years - from 0.25% to 0.5%. Its forecasts at the time indicated there could be two more increases of 0.25% over three years. But it now appears there could be a third increase and those rises could be sooner than expected. ""The Committee judges that… monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast period than anticipated at the time of the November report,"" minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC) meeting said. The Bank noted that the global economy was expanding at the fastest pace in seven years and that the UK was benefiting from that growth. It also thinks that UK wage growth will start to pick up, giving the economy a further boost. As a result, the Bank has raised its growth forecast for the UK economy to 1.8% this year, from its previous forecast of 1.6% made in November. But it says its forecasts are based on a ""smooth"" adjustment to Britain's departure from the European Union. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Today the Bank signalled that the old conventions of increasing interest rates when inflation is above target would return. The cost of mortgages is likely to rise and savers at last will see returns improve. The economy is stronger, the Bank has made clear today. But not everything in the garden is rosy. It points out that the UK economic engine still ""remains restrained by Brexit-related uncertainty"" which is ""the most significant influence on the economic outlook"". We are driving along with the hand brake half on. Growth is modest by historic standards and the UK has gone from the fastest growing economy among the G7 largest global economies to the slowest. Read Kamal's blog in full Rate rise timing Economists think it is likely that the next rate rise will come in May, but are not certain. ""All told the MPC has signalled to markets that a May rate hike is under active consideration, but is far from guaranteed... we still think that the MPC will hold back until August,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. Paul Hollingsworth, senior UK economist at Capital Economics said: ""Today's releases pave the way for an interest rate hike in May, and we think that the MPC will hike a further two times this year, taking Bank Rate to 1.25%."" Official figures last month showed that the economy grew 0.5% in the last three months of 2017, which was faster than economists had been expecting. Unemployment remains low at 4.3% and inflation edged lower in December to 3%. The Bank also released the letter sent by governor Mark Carney to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, to explain why inflation had breached the target rate of 3% in November. In the letter, Mr Carney said that higher inflation was ""almost entirely"" due to the effects of a rise in the prices of imports, caused by the fall in the pound's value after Britain voted to leave the European Union. The chancellor replied by stressing the importance of boosting UK productivity and the government's efforts to make that happen.",The Bank of England has indicated that the pace of interest rate increases could accelerate if the economy remains on its current track.
"Linda YuehChief business correspondent There is evidence, for instance, that boards of directors with greater diversity generate more dividends. That means greater returns to shareholders and fewer bonuses paid to managers. So, it matters who's at the top. Yet, only 4% of bosses in the UK financial services industry and 4.6% of chief executives of S&P 500 companies are women, and there are just six black CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. With respect to gender, there are numerous studies that show that adding women to the labour force increases national output, or gross domestic product, which I have written about before. The panel referred to evidence that makes the business case that a more diverse workplace boosted the bottom line. For instance, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study has found that changing from all-male or all-female workforces to equal numbers of both sexes could raise revenues by around 40%. Unconscious bias For women, as well as racial and ethnic minorities, these are not new debates. For LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender - executives, the issue has increasingly come to the forefront, with Apple's Tim Cook, Beth Brooke-Marciniak, of EY, and Antonio Simoes, of HSBC, generating headlines. This year was the first time that LGBT diversity was discussed on the main WEF stage, the world's biggest gathering of business and policy leaders. Everyone would agree that it's good to promote and attract talented people from all backgrounds who are qualified for the job. The challenge is how to do that with an eye on diversity and why such disparities still exist. When we asked our audience if discrimination was why top executive jobs are still not reflective of society, the show of hands indicated that nearly half thought that was still the case. The panel emphasised that a lack of diversity was due more to unconscious bias than overt discrimination. Unconscious bias leads to people hiring people like themselves. As former US State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter pointed out: ""We all hire ourselves."" She also stressed that women CAN have it all - if there are changes in the workplace. An article she wrote in 2012, Why Women Still Can't Have It All, generates debate to this day. So, it seems that systemic policies and workplace practises that ensure that merit is rewarded are still needed. These aren't straightforward to fashion. Mentorship and role models, childcare assistance, and being conscious of female labour force interruptions to start a family, were all mentioned by the panel. Tokenism And, the panel debated whether affirmative action or positive discrimination was needed, or if that would lead to tokenism. Bernard Tyson, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente, one of America's largest healthcare companies and one of the few black bosses, and Beth Brooke-Marciniak, global vice-chair of public policy at EY (formerly Ernst & Young) who is the most senior openly gay female executive of a large global company, both said that an appointment that added to diversity was a worthwhile criterion. Inga Beale, the first female chief executive of Lloyds of London in its 327 year history, said that she doesn't worry about tokenism, but the ""rule of three"" mattered - you need three people of diverse backgrounds and not just one. Once teams are diversified, there won't be tokens. Measuring outcomes is another issue. How is success measured? Guy Ryder, the head of the International Labour Organisation, and Anne-Marie Slaughter, now the CEO of New America, would like to see organisations reflect the societies in which they operate. For others on the panel, having a diverse work environment where people can be themselves was what they wanted to see. In terms of a diversity dividend, no one wants to see talent wasted. There are also other forms of diversity, such as being physically challenged, to be considered. But, how to achieve a diverse workplace that generates dividends will require a lot more discussion not just in legislatures, but in boardrooms, schools, and in communities.","Is there a diversity dividend? That was the question that we posed in a special Talking Business programme from the World Economic Forum, in Davos."
"The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said most High Street banks had set ""very similar prices"", after it demanded changes to the system. Several big brands including Santander, Lloyds Banking Group and HSBC are set to bring in a 39.9% rate this year. The FCA has sent a letter to banks, asking them to explain what influenced their decision. The City regulator has also asked how the banks will deal with any customers who could be worse off following the changes. It said some firms could reduce or waive interest for customers who are in financial difficulty because of their overdraft. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, told the BBC's Today programme that seven in 10 customers would be better off or unaffected by the new rules. ""If you had an unarranged overdraft before, you saw some rates that were 10 times higher than the equivalent payday loans. ""The reforms force banks to publish clear headline rates, without fixed fees and charges in them. In some banks, as many as nine in 10 customers will be better off, or no worse off."" What's changing for overdraft charges? The FCA has introduced tough new rules for the ""dysfunctional"" overdraft market. It says it wants to get rid of ""confusing"" fees for customers. The new rules, which come into force in April this year, will stop banks and building societies from charging higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts. They will also require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and to get rid of fixed daily or monthly fees. However, some analysts have warned that steep overdraft rates could become ""the new normal"". Is this competition? As the hackneyed phrase says, we change partners more often than we switch bank accounts. So, when the FCA announced what it called the biggest overhaul of overdrafts for generation, its aim was to inspire competition. The theory is that a clear, simple overdraft interest rate allows customers to compare and move current accounts, potentially saving them a lot of money. Now the banks have pretty much clustered around the same, somewhat expensive 40% rate, there is little sign of any competition at all. It should not be forgotten that the changes will mean more support for those facing financial trouble, and those who used to regularly bust their overdraft limit will not be hit so hard. But you can understand the accusations that the reforms have backfired for the regulator, and why it has now responded by asking questions of the banks. Most banks and building societies have chosen to set a rate very close to 40%. Lloyds Banking Group, which includes the Halifax bank, was one of the latest big brands to announce most customers will soon pay an annual rate of 39.9% to dip into their overdraft. That means they would pay £39.90 for each £100 borrowed in an overdraft for a whole year. The FCA has previously acknowledged that banks might increase their arranged overdraft prices as a result of the new rules. But it argues the overall effect will still be better for customers - and increased competition between providers as a result of the changes will constrain any price increases.",The UK's financial regulator has asked banks to explain how they have decided their new overdraft rates.
"By Simon JackBusiness editor, BBC News In recent years, former chief executive Antony Jenkins and before him Bob Diamond had described Africa as an important growth market for the bank. Admitting it was a difficult decision, Jes Staley explained it was a decision taken to de-risk the bank. Owning a majority share meant Barclays had to hold a lot more capital as a buffer against mishap with, what regulators consider, a risky asset. Barclays Africa employs 45,000 people, a third of Barclays' global workforce, so it is not an easy thing to sell and the list of potential buyers is not a long one. At the top of that list is... you guessed it, ex-Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond. Mr Diamond left Barclays under the cloud of the Libor rate-rigging scandal having lost the confidence of the governor of the Bank of England. Once described as the unacceptable face of banking by Peter Mandelson, Bob Diamond went on to create an African banking venture called Atlas Mara with ambitions to create a sub-Saharan banking business. As chairman he has appointed another ex-Barclays man, John Vitalo, as chief executive. Before joining Barclays, Mr Vitalo ran Absa Capital, the investment-banking arm of the South African lender Barclays bought control of in 2005. I am told that although Atlas Mara may currently lack the firepower to buy the whole business, it would be interested in acquiring some of Barclays' African business. There is no guarantee this curious circle will be completed - other interested parties could include Gulf and Chinese interests - but Bob Diamond and John Vitalo know this business inside out and Barclays certainly have their numbers.",The news that Barclays intends to retreat from Africa after 100 years of doing business there was one of the most eye-catching lines from the new chief executive Jes Staley.
"The online gambling firm made a pre-tax profit of £300,000 in the three months to 30 April, down from £12.1m a year earlier.

"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent In its new assessment of the World Economic Outlook, the IMF predicts growth this year and next of 3.9%. However, it warned that performance could be curtailed by trade barriers. For the UK, the IMF has made a modest upgrade for growth this year to 1.6%. For next year, the forecast has been slightly reduced, to 1.5%. The IMF report warned that the current momentum was ""not assured"". It lists a number of risks that could lead to weaker performance than its main forecast, including what it calls policies that ""harm international trade"". The report refers to ""waning support for global integration"". It says increased trade barriers - tariffs or other restrictions - could harm sentiment in financial markets, disrupt global supply chains and slow the spread of new technology. Protectionism also affects consumers by making tradable goods more expensive. WTO warns over tit-for-tat trade wars The complexity of UK/EU trade talks The increased tension in recent months over trade largely reflects President Trump's view that the deficit in US trade - the country imports more than it exports - is a result of poor agreements negotiated by his predecessors and other countries taking advantage of the US. But IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld dismisses the idea that the steps taken by the US can reduce the deficit. He says the reason for the deficit is that total spending in the US exceeds income. He says that recent tax measures are actually likely to increase the deficit. The general thrust of this report is relatively upbeat for the near-term future. The forecasts for this year and next have been raised. The upgrade to global growth for this year to 3.9% potentially makes 2018 the strongest year since 2011, when the economy was rebounding from the financial crisis. Mr Obstfeld describes the upgrade from 3.7% as ""substantial"". Compared with forecasts issued in October 2017, the predictions for this year for the euro-area, Japan and the US have all been raised by half a percentage point or slightly more. For the UK, the report says that unemployment close to historic lows could add to inflationary pressures, by triggering faster wage growth. Inflation is already above the government and Bank of England's target of 2%. The IMF says further increases in interest rates are needed to bring price rises back towards that rate. Lurking dangers That said, Mr Obstfeld describes longer-term prospects as ""more sobering"". In the developed economies, he says, ageing populations and low growth in productivity (the amount each worker produces) mean they are unlikely to achieve the per capita growth rates they managed before the crisis - and it is per capita growth that drives average living standards. Among developing countries, he says those that depend on exporting commodities need to diversify their economies. There are warnings about the risks ahead, lurking dangers that could lead to the global economy falling short of the IMF's forecasts, in addition to the concerns about trade. Debt levels - private and government - are very high. That could lead to debtors getting into difficulty with repayments as interest rates rise from the post-financial crisis lows.",The International Monetary Fund has forecast that 2018 will be the strongest year for global growth since 2011.
"Consumer prices in the world's second largest economy rose 6.2% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in July. Food prices have been the main reason for the rising costs in the country. Separately, the Bureau said China's industrial output had risen 13.5% in August year-on-year, slightly down on growth in July. Analysts said the inflation data seemed to indicate that government steps to slow the overheating economy were starting to take hold. ""The fall was the largest decline in inflation this year, and offers some hope that price growth, led by the surge in food prices, has peaked,"" said George Worthington of IFR Markets. Monetary policy Beijing has maintained that containing price growth is the government's top priority. China's central bank has raised interest rates five times since October 2010 and increased the reserve ratio requirements for banks in the country nine times during the period. That means banks have had to hold more cash in their reserves, effectively reducing the amount of loans being given out. Analysts said the latest numbers may make the central bank change its stance on monetary policy. ""On the policy front, tightening steps are at least on hold now,"" said Dong Xian'an of Peking First Advisory. IFR Markets' Mr Worthington added that Beijing may actually start easing its policies early next year, ""provided inflation has fallen to around 5% or lower"". Broader concerns While consumer prices fell in July, analysts said that authorities needed to do more to contain rising prices. ""The easing in consumer inflation was not broad-based in August. The main contribution is a moderation in pork price rises,"" said Ren Xianfang of IHS Global Insight. Data released by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing last week showed that manufacturers were hit by the higher cost of raw materials in August. The input price sub-index, a key measure of how much factories pay for raw materials, rose to 57.2 in August from 56.3 in July. Analysts said that until price growth is contained across the board, inflation would remain a threat to the Chinese economy. ""China still faces pretty high inflationary pressures,"" Ms Ren added. Other data released on Friday showed that retail sales jumped 17% in August, while fixed asset investment, a measure of government spending on infrastructure, rose 25% in the first eight months of 2011.","China's rate of inflation eased in August, after hitting a three-year high in July, according to the National Statistics Bureau."
"The ceremony in Auckland brings the huge trade pact, which has been five years in the making, another step towards to becoming a reality. But the TPP continues to face opposition. The 12 nations account for some 40% of the world's economy - they now have two years to ratify or reject the pact. Australia's minister for trade Andrew Robb was the first to sign the pact. Those attending the ceremony cheered as his counterpart, New Zealand trade minister Todd McClay, added the last signature. The TPP involves the US, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. Those against the deal, particularly some Americans, fear it could mean jobs will move from the US to developing countries. 'Write the rules of 21st Century' However, US President Barack Obama said the agreement was a new type of trade deal ""that puts American workers first"". ""Partnership would give the United States an advantage over other leading economies, namely China,"" he said in a statement on Wednesday. ""TPP allows America - and not countries like China - to write the rules of the road in the 21st Century, which is especially important in a region as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific,"" he said. ""We should get TPP done this year and give more American workers the shot at success they deserve and help more American businesses compete and win around the world."" In Auckland and in the US, among other countries, protestors have voiced their anger about the trade pact over the past several months. In the lead up to Thursday's signing, the streets around Auckland's central business district were disrupted by groups blocking access to the Auckland Harbour Bridge. Police clashed with some protestors, who have widely claimed the deal will benefit big business rather than workers. Behind the deal The trade deal looks to facilitate investment between 12 countries across the Pacific Rim, which together account for about 40% of the global economy. It was agreed in October last year after years of negotiations and multiple missed deadlines. The US-led initiative is a key part of Mr Obama's so-called pivot to Asia but has proved to be a controversial issue ahead of the US elections in November. Mr Obama has barely a year left on his term and his administration warns that the US economy will suffer if politicians don't ratify the agreement. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the deal could add $100bn (£68.5bn) a year to US growth. ""After five years of negotiation, signing the TPP is an important milestone in our efforts to set high-standard rules of the road in the Asia Pacific region and more generally, and to deliver an agreement that will benefit American workers, farmers and businesses,"" he said.","The Trans Pacific Partnership , one of the biggest multinational trade deals ever, has been signed by ministers from its 12 member nations in New Zealand."
"The company said half of the job losses would go through redundancies. Most of the cuts are expected to be in the UK. However, Centrica said it would also create jobs in growth areas, so the net loss in jobs will be 4,000 from the firm's current total of 37,500. First half profits at British Gas's residential arm rose to £528m. That was up from £265m a year earlier. Centrica group profits fell 3% to £1bn. Centrica said the rise in profits at British Gas was due to higher gas consumption, which was triggered by the cold weather earlier this year compared with milder weather in the first half of 2014. However, the strong performance at British Gas was offset by a collapse in profits at Centrica's oil and gas production division. Profits in this unit fell 78% to £116m as a result of lower oil prices. Profits 'not excessive' Centrica appointed Iain Conn as chief executive at the start of this year. He has been conducting a strategic review of the business over the past five months, which has concluded Centrica should concentrate on the British Gas side of the business and reduce its activities in actual energy production, which takes major investment. That is a less attractive business currently, as raw energy costs, such as oil, are around $50-60 a barrel, half the levels of last year. Centrica said it was assuming the oil price would not move far from that for the foreseeable future. Mr Conn denied the company was making excessive profits at British Gas. British Gas cut prices by 5% earlier this year, and is due to cut gas prices by a further 5% next month, which the firm says will mean average savings of £72 a year. Mr Conn said profits per customer would remain at the same level as in other years, at about £40-£65 a year. Analysis: John Moylan, BBC industry correspondent This is a major change in direction for one of Britain's most important energy firms. In a world of $60-a-barrel oil, out goes the heavy investment of recent years in offshore oil and gas production. Instead the company will refocus on its millions of customers, offering them new products and services. It sees a particular opportunity managing the needs of big commercial energy users. The cost cutting goes further and faster than some expected. The majority of the 6,000 job losses will be in the UK, and 3,000 will go by the end of 2017. Iain Conn told me that the move was necessary to become internationally efficient and to grow in the future. But the doubling in profits at British Gas is likely to raise concerns, coming just weeks after a major competition probe concluded that the big six energy firms have been overcharging their customers for years. Quality Gary Smith, national officer of the GMB union, said: ""This will be a day of deep concern across British Gas."" However, he added that the news was not all bad. ""What we do take from this announcement is a focus on the long term and investment in customer service which gives us room for optimism over front-line jobs."" He said that these were already being created, and were high quality posts. ""This year, there are over 1,200 jobs being created for smart metering installers and in repairing and installing appliances. ""These are real jobs, skilled jobs and they are being filled by ex-military personnel, a lot of women and of course, young people."" British Gas supplies nine million households, meaning that it has more domestic customers than any of its rivals. The energy sector has come under scrutiny by the Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA), which earlier this month said energy companies were collectively overcharging customers by £1bn a year. Mr Conn disputed the figure, telling the BBC that it amounted to more than the profits of the entire industry. Centrica also announced it would cut the interim dividend by 30%, a move that affects some 650,000 individual small shareholders.","Energy firm Centrica has said it will cut 6,000 jobs as it reported a doubling of profits at its British Gas business in the first half of the year."
"Nearly 1,700 machines started charging for withdrawals in the first three months of the year, with the majority starting to charge in March, according to the consumer lobby group. Cardtronics, which runs most of those, and fellow provider NoteMachine are both likely to charge at more machines. That could mean the country losing 13% of its free ATMs in only a few months. The changes come after a reduction in the fee operators receive from banks each time an ATM is used. Link, which oversees ATMs, began to cut the fee, known as the interchange rate, last year. So far it has reduced the charge from 25p to 23p per withdrawal. Link said at the time that the move was aimed at protecting the ATM network. It left the fee for free-to-use ATMs - which are 1km or more from the next nearest cash machine - unchanged. The town struggling with a cash machine shortage Ashleigh Cooper from Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire has seen the number of cash machines dwindle from six down to two. Mr Cooper, aged 60, said: ""It causes real problems especially on bank holidays. There are no banks here anymore. We have a mobile bank that visits every few weeks but that's no good to me. ""Hebden Bridge is quite a touristy area and there's usually a problem with one of the cash machines going out of order because it's run out of cash. ""The local cinema here was always a cash business but they're now having to accept digital payments or lose punters. ""For me it's like going back to the dark ages, it's crazy."" ATM operators receive the interchange fee from banks each time one of their cash machines is used. NoteMachine, which operates 7,000 cash machines across the UK, said the cut in the interchange rate meant it was considering introducing fees at up to 4,000 of its machines. ""Unless urgent action is taken to reduce the pressure on ATM operators by reversing the interchange fee reductions, NoteMachine will be forced to begin converting ATMs to surcharging,"" said chief executive Peter McNamara. Rival ATM machine operator Cardtronics has said it is likely to convert another 1,000 of its ATMs over the coming months. It said it ""had been forced into charging a fee for cash withdrawals on some of our machines where Link's cuts have left us with no choice"". There were about 52,000 free cash machines in the country at the start of the year. Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, said: ""Communities are being stripped of free access to cash at an alarming rate that could hit the most vulnerable in our society the hardest, while denying millions of people free withdrawals. ""A regulator is desperately needed to get a grip of these rapid changes across the cash landscape and ensure all those still reliant on this important payment method aren't suddenly shut out from accessing the cash they need in their daily lives."" 'I'm shut out of cash' Reported charges range from 50p to £1.99 and the situation angered some of the respondents to the Which? survey. Anita Brakewell, from Blackpool, said: ""Being disabled means I don't have the option of walking to the next free cash machine, so these charges shut me out of cash that's important to my daily life. ""My town has also suffered from bank branch closures, making it hard to access the cash and financial services I need."" And Robin Farnsworth, from Kirkcaldy, said: ""I stopped using the local cashpoint when it started charging me just to access my cash. I'm on a very tight budget and can't afford to be spending out just to get the money I need for everyday life."" Bank of England figures show that 2.2 million people are almost entirely reliant on cash. And last year's Access to Cash study, published in December, found that more than eight million people would struggle to cope in a cashless society, which would present real challenges for 25 million UK residents. However, cash use has halved in the past 10 years and in 2017, debit cards overtook notes and coins as the UK's most popular payment method. Analysis by Personal Finance Correspondent, Simon Gompertz There is a fierce, three-way, struggle going on over the future of our network of free-to-use cash machines. The upstarts are independent operators like Cardtronics and Note Machine which now have the most ATMs. Then there are the banks. They have to pay the operators each time their customers use a non-bank machine. Finally, we have Link which runs the network and has been trying to get the operators to accept lower payments from the banks. Two cuts to the payments have been pushed through, prompting Cardtronics to say it is being ""forced"" to charge the customer instead. And the backdrop is that we are using less cash, which means fewer withdrawals and less chance that a cash machine will pay its way. So it's not clear where this will end. But more charging will cause anger and frustration amongst those who depend heavily on cash.","Free-to-use cash machines have been disappearing at a rapid rate across the UK, according to a study by Which?"
"Analysts said June's hot weather had helped to lift sales at the company, which also includes Argos. The UK's second biggest supermarket said like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - grew by 2.3%, excluding petrol. Chief executive Mike Coupe said he was ""pleased"" with the results - its best growth in four years. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The recent heatwave helped to boost sales at Sainsbury's group, as customers turned to the Argos website to buy electric fans and paddling pools to keep cool in the hot weather."" Demand for deals on British strawberries and its summer eating range added to Sainsbury's grocery sales, which were up 3%. Food price inflation also contributed to a rise in sales at the supermarket's checkouts. Analysis: Emma Simpson, BBC business reporter This is the best quarterly performance by Sainsbury's in years, with sales up across the board. Like the other main supermarkets, inflation is driving some of this sales growth. The boss said the company had managed to ""keep a control over prices"" and that the rise in own label goods had been a big success. Was this a sign of shoppers trading down, for instance eating in instead of eating out? Chief executive Mike Coupe said there wasn't any evidence of a massive change in consumer behaviour although there might be a trend starting to come through. Most striking though is the rise in clothing sales - up by more than 7%, a very strong performance, in stark contrast to its competitors on the high street. A sign, perhaps, that consumers are watching their wallets. Mr Coupe said ""inflation was coming through"", but that Sainsbury's was trying to keep prices down by striking deals with suppliers. He pointed to chicken, milk and broccoli, which he said were cheaper than three years ago. The company's latest sales figures marked an acceleration from the previous quarter when sales grew by just 0.3%. The growth was also slightly stronger than expected, with analysts having forecast like-for-like sales to grow 2%. David Alexander of GlobalData, said: ""Even accounting for a later Easter and Mother's Day, and the inclusion of a buoyant Argos in the figures, the numbers still present a positive picture."" Nisa deal talks Widespread media reports have suggested Sainsbury's is lining up Nisa, a convenience store chain and wholesaler, for its next acquisition. George MacDonald, editor of Retail Week, told the BBC that Sainsbury's was ""possibly grabbing on the coat-tails of Tesco which wants to buy another wholesaler called Booker"". However, Mr Coupe declined to comment on any possible Nisa deal, saying it regularly looked at potential tie-ups. ""We are not holding onto anyone's coat-tails - that's just the nature of a large corporation. Most of these conversations come to nothing,"" the Sainsbury's boss told reporters.","Sainsbury's has said sales of clothes, summer food and paddling pools helped speed up growth in the past few months."
"By Kim GittlesonBusiness reporter, BBC News, Clyde, Ohio The tower is a clear symbol of the small Ohio town's economic heart. Whirpool's 2.5 million sq ft (232,000 sq m) washing machine factory dominates the main drag here, and the businesses along this stretch, such as Gary's Diner and Pizza House, are often filled with the appliance manufacturer's workers. On the factory floor, the din is overwhelming. More than 3,000 workers - half the population of Clyde - are busy testing, screwing, welding, and painting the hundreds of pieces that make up the company's washing machines. This is the largest washing machine plant in the world, with 30 miles (50km) of overhead conveyor belts that clatter along, carrying assorted barrel drums and metal doors. But stop for the time it takes to make one machine - approximately four seconds - and a few things will become apparent that differ from factories past. Those carts driving by, filled with grey fabric? They have no driver. They are automated to follow an orange line on the ground. And those LED screens at each assembly line? They monitor each worker's productivity to the second and can give instant feedback about how to improve production. Such details make the plant one of Whirlpool's most productive, and it is one reason why the company, when it was looking to move production from a plant in Mexico, decided to bring jobs back to Ohio. ""There's been a lot of focus both by the company and the employees to become more efficient, more effective,"" says Whirlpool vice president Jeff Noel. ""That's made making products in the US more competitive than it has been in the past."" Homecoming American manufacturing lost more than two million jobs during the recession, accelerating a decline that began long ago in the 1970s. Yet since then, manufacturing has been one of the biggest drivers of job growth in the US, adding more than 500,000 jobs. While much of that job growth could be attributable to post-recession pent-up demand, that is not the whole story. According to the Reshoring Initiative, a group of companies and trade associations trying to bring factory jobs back to the US, about 10% of those job gains - 50,000 jobs - were created by companies bringing back manufacturing from overseas. Last March, General Electric's (GE's) chief executive, Jeffrey Immelt, wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review where he announced that GE planned to add more than 1,000 manufacturing jobs at its Louisville, Kentucky, facility - a manufacturing plant the company tried to sell only a few years ago during the depths of the recession. ""We can bring manufacturing back to the United States and be profitable,"" Mr Immelt said. Better, faster, more productive There are many reasons why corporate accounts are once again favouring the American worker. Higher labour costs abroad, coupled with cheap natural gas as a result of the fracking boom in the US as well as workers who are willing to work for lower wages have made it more economical than it once was to produce back in America. Moreover, changing consumer behaviour means customers often want products immediately and with varying specifications, so ""it's better to be closer to your customers"", according to Mr Noel. Finally, newer factories with increasingly automated technology require a more highly educated workforce, which the US has as a result of its manufacturing past. Besides, automation costs are roughly the same wherever in the world a company operates. With all these factors combined, by 2015, a variety of manufacturing industries, from appliances to tyres, will find it more cost effective to produce goods in the United States, according to a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group. This could add an estimated two to three million jobs and more than $20bn (£12.4bn) in output to the American economy - a striking reversal from years past. First comes a breeze But 2015 is a long way off, and some remain sceptical. ""The best data we have shows us that nothing like a manufacturing reshoring wave is happening now,"" says manufacturing expert Alan Tonelson, of the US Business and Industry council. With headwinds from Europe, dysfunctional politics in Washington, and US trade policy that continues to encourage overseas production, the growth in manufacturing job creation appears to be slowing down, Mr Tonelson adds. And even if all of these factors were to disappear, it would be unlikely that the jobs added would ever be able to replace the more than eight million jobs that have been lost since the 1970s. 'Family business' For Clyde's workers and others in the local community, Whirlpool's commitment has allowed them to breathe easy for the first time in a while. ""It's very important for us, especially since they're the largest manufacturer in our county,"" says Kay Reiter, executive director of the Sandusky County Economic Development Corporation. ""If you look at all the suppliers that we have already locally, it's huge."" The hope is that Clyde can continue as it has been since Whirlpool first came to the town in 1952; as a place once described in American literature by Sherwood Anderson as the quintessential American small town. For this community, ""Made in America"" is not a fading sentiment. It is a rallying cry. ""I've been with Whirlpool for 26 years,"" says Sonny Workman, who works on the Alpha assembly line in the plant. ""My dad worked here, my aunts and uncles too. It's the family business.""","Visitors to Clyde are greeted with the view of a water tower presiding over the flat landscape, carrying a large Whirlpool logo."
"The regulator, Ofgem, has warned the supplier that it needs to meet monthly targets on late billing. Unless it meets the targets by the end of August, Npower will have to stop all ""proactive telesales"" to new customers, the regulator warned. In a statement, Npower said that it was apologising to its customers ""again"". The company has topped the complaints tables for the ""big six"" energy firms every quarter since the end of 2012. Last month, Citizens Advice said its customer service operations were ""unacceptable"". Earlier this week, consumer group Which? said Npower had received 83 complaints per 1,000 customers in the first quarter of 2014, nearly twice as many as the next worst performer. Apology Separately, Ofgem is to launch an investigation into Npower's customer service failings. The company could face another fine if it is found to have broken the rules under the regulator's new standards of conduct. It was fined £2m by Ofgem in 2011 and was forced to apologise to its customers in December 2013. ""We have been increasingly concerned about the slow progress to tackle failings,"" said Sarah Harrison, Ofgem's senior partner in charge of enforcement. ""Npower's recovery plan has not delivered as far and fast as is necessary. Our analysis of complaints data also raises some serious concerns, which will be thoroughly examined in our investigation,"" she said. The company said it had hired 650 people more since December to try to resolve the problems with its computer system. It said it would be investing an extra £20m this year to help improve customer service. ""We are committed to getting things right for our customers but recognise that despite the progress we have made, our current billing standards have fallen short of where everyone wants them to be,"" said Paul Massara, Npower's chief executive. 'Bill shock' Citizens Advice, which has highlighted problems with Npower, welcomed the regulator's clamp-down. ""Exposing customers to bill shock is completely unacceptable and can throw household budgets into disarray,"" said Gillian Guy, the Citizens Advice chief executive. ""For people struggling to make ends meet, finding hundreds of pounds to pay a large bill out of the blue can be impossible,"" she said. However, Npower said that in May, 92% of its customers were sent their bills on time. It said it was offering extended repayment periods for anyone who had had problems as a result of getting a bill late. It also said that anyone who received a bill that was more than 12 months late would not have to pay it, if the fault was with the company.",Energy supplier Npower has been told that it may have to stop sales to new customers unless it can send out bills on time.
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent The bloc's executive arm predicts a recovery in 2021 but warns that the uncertainty is exceptionally high. The Commission predicts a decline in economic activity this year of 7.5%, and slightly more than that for the eurozone. It warns the outcome could be worse if the pandemic turns out to be longer or more severe than currently envisaged. European and other governments are intentionally blocking economic activity to contain the virus, so a sharp downturn is inevitable. That said, the Commission's forecasts do put some rather stark numbers on the extent of the damage the EU can expect to sustain. 'Great Depression' The Commission describes the downturn as a recession of historic proportions. Paolo Gentiloni, the Commissioner for the Economy called it ""a shock without precedent since the Great Depression"". The impact will be uneven, Mr Gentiloni said, conditioned by how quickly the lockdowns can be lifted and by the importance of services such as tourism in the national economies. The forecasts for specific countries do indeed point to an especially severe impact in some that that are popular tourist destinations. The deepest predicted contraction of all is for Greece. At 9.7% that would be more than the worst in single year during the financial crisis, although the country did have a succession of bad years that added up to a much larger decline than is likely in 2020. Spain and Italy are also forecast to have declines in excess of 9%. The revisions to the forecasts for two other Mediterranean countries- Malta and Cyprus - were also relatively large. Severe Inevitably, such an extensive impact on economic activity will mean job losses. The Commission says that policies such as short-time working schemes, job subsidies and support to businesses should help to limit the damage to employment, but the impact on the labour market will nonetheless be severe. The report predicts an increase in unemployment in every EU state. That said, the predicted highs are not as bad as they were in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The two worst for predictions for this year are unemployment rates of 19.9% for Greece and 18.9% for Spain. Those figures are annual averages so there would be peaks during the year that are significantly higher. But those annual figures are still well below the equivalent levels, which were in the high twenties, that the two countries suffered as a result of the following the financial crisis. Trade threat It will be harder, the Commission says, for young people to get their first jobs. The growth predicted for 2021 at 6.1% is less than the contraction the Commission envisages for this year. It would therefore be 2022 at the earliest when the EU economy gets back to the level of activity it experienced last year. The report also notes that unsuccessful trade negotiations with the UK could further impede any recovery: ""The threat of tariffs [on traded goods] following the end of the transition period between the EU and United Kingdom could also dampen growth, albeit to a lesser extent in the EU than in the UK.""","The European Union faces a deep and uneven recession, according to a new forecast from the EU's Commission."
"The regulator said GT, and its partner Robert Napper, had admitted a ""lack of professional competence and due care"". This had allowed AssetCo to falsely inflate its value and its share price. Mr Napper was fined £130,000 and banned from auditing for three years, while GT paid £200,000 in additional costs. The FRC said that the auditors had been deceived by the management of AssetCo, a fire engine manufacturer once owned by British Gas. But the auditors had been at fault by failing to employ the required level of ""professional scepticism"". Gareth Rees QC, executive counsel to the FRC, said: ""The respondents have admitted widespread and significant failings in their audit work, and GT specifically has accepted there were serious failings in the execution of certain aspects of the firm's quality control procedures."" ""This misconduct is rightly reflected in the seriousness of the sanctions, such as the exclusion of Mr Napper from membership of the ICAEW (Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales) and the fines on both respondents."" Standards 'fell short' The FRC said that the failings of GT, and the now-retired Mr Napper, in the audit of AssetCo's accounts were not deliberate or reckless and did not amount to dishonesty. Even so, the AssetCo audits were so poor that the accountants' behaviour ""fell significantly short of the standards reasonable expected of them"", and showed a ""widespread lack of professional competence and due care in the performance of the audits."" The FRC said that GT - the UK's fifth largest accountancy firm - and Mr Napper, who had had 23 years experience, were deliberately misled by AssetCo's management. But if they had been more sceptical of the financial information being given to them they would have uncovered the dishonesty. The inflated value of AssetCo, whose main customers were the London and Lincolnshire fire services, and which had a listing on the Alternative Investment Market, had been achieved by the exaggeration of its assets and by inventing sources of income. That in turn meant that the firm's shareholders suffered large losses when the value of the shares fell from £6 each in 2009 to just £1 each in 2011. AssetCo subsequently teetered on the verge of insolvency and the FRC is currently taking action against three of the firm's former executives. Based in Monmouthshire, the firm now operates only in the Middle East. A GT spokeswoman said the firm regretted its failings. ""Our audit quality processes have evolved significantly since these audits were performed in 2009 and 2010 and we are determined in our efforts to ensure our work is of the highest quality. ""Given the FRC's ongoing proceedings against three former executives of AssetCo, in which the FRC alleges, amongst other things, that they acted dishonestly or recklessly, we are unable to comment further,"" she added.","Accountancy firm Grant Thornton (GT), has been fined £2.3m and severely reprimanded by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) over failings in its audit of a company called AssetCo."
"They later sold the enterprise to AOL for $850m dollars in 2008. The couple met in London, where they worked as computer programmers. ""We were always entrepreneurially minded,"" says Xochi Birch. She and Michael were attracted to the idea of setting up online businesses because ""it seemed like the easiest thing to do"". They decided to start their own company when Michael arrived home one day and said: ""I want to quit my job and let's do an internet start-up."" ""I had no idea what that meant at the time,"" Xochi remembers. She soon found out: ""I would work continuously for the next three years [to] support him, seeing as he was at home, figuring our internet start-ups."" She confesses that despite their background in computers and programming they were ""complete amateurs"" when it came to internet start-ups. Michael recalls the beginning as ""a comedy of errors, just trying things out"". It didn't help that they had no clear product in mind. ""We just wanted to build consumer internet websites,"" explains Michael. ""We thought if we could get millions of users without spending much money, we could probably make some money out of it."" He says now it was a ""very under-developed plan"". Nothing ventured Michael and Xochi Birch began their venture into online start-ups in 1999, very shortly before the dotcom boom exploded. They believe they were lucky because unlike other established online companies they still had nothing to lose ""We had not spent a cent, we had not raised a cent, and we were still learning a lot,"" says Xochi. Indeed, it would be another three years before one of their online start-ups became profitable. They decided to remortgage their home twice to raise the capital to fund their venture. ""It was a bit of a gamble,"" says Michael. ""But I always felt that we both came from stable families. I thought, 'Worst thing happens; we go and live with my parents or her parents, and look for a job'."" In their quest to launch the perfect online company, they tried out many approaches, including a will-writing facility and an online address book. But their first real success came when they launched Birthday Alarm, a website which alerts users to people's birthdays. By 2002 they had 2 million members, had moved to California (where Xochi was born and grew up), and were making $10,000 a month from the site. ""We were very focused in the early days on growth because we realised whatever our revenue would be, it would always be proportional to how many members we had,"" explains Michael. A key turning point came when they decided to charge members for sending e-cards. ""We went from earning $10,000 a month to $10,000 a day. Overnight, by flipping a switch,"" says Xochi. Social networking Despite the success and profits, Xochi and Michael Birch didn't plan on packing away their keyboards just then. Social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace were just becoming popular and the couple decided to use their profits to create their own versions. Their first platform, called Ringo, attracted 400,000 users before they sold it. But it was their second creation, Bebo, that became a global hit. The couple say that despite the presence of their online rivals they felt there was room to be innovative. ""Facebook was a very good website, but it was limited to students,"" explains Michael. The couple saw room for Bebo as a hybrid version of existing networks, summarising it as essentially ""a very good version of MySpace… but with the product quality of Facebook"". Like other social networking sites, Bebo experienced its fair share of controversy, over matters such as privacy. But a bigger challenge proved to be establishing the brand in a competitive market, says Michael Birch. ""I'd say we partly succeeded… I was never happy enough with the product, it never lived up to the standards that I wanted for it."" Deciding to sell the company to AOL for $850m dollars wasn't a hard decision. Although at the time of the sale Mr and Mrs Birch were no longer the sole owners, they still received a substantial proportion of the proceeds. The large amount of money has been helpful in funding further entrepreneurial projects - but, they say, it didn't shock them. ""The biggest change in our lives was when we started making money from Birthday Alarm"" explains Michael. ""By the time we'd sold Bebo, we had millions in the bank. To hundreds of millions wasn't, in many ways, that big a shift."" 'Have a sense of humour' Starting a business is always stressful but how much more difficult is it when you're also husband and wife? ""There's one person that's going to be down, at any time, and the other person's there to kind of cheer you up, and I think that's the relationship we have,"" says Xochi. She adds: ""You must have a good sense of humour… you need to be able to laugh at yourself."" As Bebo grew in size, the couple found managing a larger team to be something of a challenge. ""We don't really manage people, we just hope they do the right thing,"" says Michael. ""We enjoyed the really early stage of creating and building,"" he says. ""When it became fairly political internally… it just stopped being fun."" But the two entrepreneurs have no intention of slowing down. They have gone on to launch a number of other start-ups since selling Bebo. They also recently attended a business conference in Delhi, to learn more about entrepreneurship in India. ""Our work defines us,"" says Xochi. ""There was never a moment where we thought we would retire to an island in the Bahamas.""","Michael and Xochi Birch are a husband-and-wife team of entrepreneurs who are best known for setting up Bebo, the social networking company."
"It follows a report by HS2 chairman Sir David Higgins last week which said a link from the planned HS2 terminus at Euston to neighbouring St Pancras where Eurostar leaves would be too expensive. It rules out the prospect of direct trains from northern England to Europe. Work on the HS2 high-speed line from London to Birmingham and to Manchester and Leeds has not yet begun. Mr McLoughlin said a link to the Eurostar service which runs on HS1 from St Pancras through the Channel Tunnel would ""require too many compromises"". It would have cost an estimated £700m. The cost of the total project is currently estimated at £42.6bn. He added: ""I therefore intend to remove the link from the hybrid bill."" Mr McLouglin said that Sir David's idea, also presented in his report last week, of speeding up construction of HS2 to Crewe was a welcome one and would be ""looked at in detail, as would the idea of an extensive upgrade of Euston station"". Earlier this month, Mr McLoughlin admitted that legislation needed to build the high-speed rail project would not become law before the next general election in 2015.","The HS2 rail route will not be linked to the Eurostar's line, confirmed Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter The Royal Mint has said that it saw a ""surge"" in demand for the precious metal following the Bank of England's cut in base rates to 0.25% on 4 August. During that week the Mint saw a 25% increase in transactions on its bullion website. It also experienced a 50% increase in sales of gold bars and coins, compared with the previous week. It is thought investors are turning to gold as cash and bonds offer diminishing returns, exacerbated by lower interest rates. So far this year, the price of gold has risen by 45% in sterling terms, and 25% in dollar terms. Record demand ""Although the stock market has been doing well of late, it didn't do so well at the start of the year, and there was a lot of volatility around the time of the referendum,"" said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Landown. ""That helps gold."" However he also warned that gold prices will not necessarily continue rising. ""It's worth pointing out gold is by no means a one way bet - in 2011 it was trading at above $1800 an ounce. It's an insurance policy for the rest of your investments and as such should make up no more than 5-10% of your portfolio."" Gold is currently trading at $1344 an ounce. Earlier this week, the World Gold Council reported that global investment demand for gold hit a record level in the first six months of this year. However consumer demand in countries such as India and China, traditionally among the strongest buyers of gold, was lower.",It seems the quest for gold is not currently limited to the venues of Rio de Janeiro.
"Brent crude fell 6.3% to $30.15 a barrel following a 10% rise on Friday, while US oil shed 7.1% to $29.90. The slide came as the head of Opec called for all oil-producing nations to work together. Abdullah al-Badri said both Opec and non-Opec oil producers needed to tackle oversupply to help prices rise. ""It is vital the market addresses the issue of the stock overhang. As you can see from previous cycles, once this overhang starts falling then prices start to rise,"" he told a conference in London. Despite the ongoing refusal of Saudi Arabia, the dominant Opec member, to cut production, Mr al-Badri nevertheless blamed countries outside the cartel for the huge global oil glut. ""Yes, Opec provided some of the additional supply last year, but the majority of this has come from non-Opec countries,"" he said. Opec accounts for almost 42% of the world's oil production. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent What's an oil producer to do amid tumbling prices? Ask everybody in the business to cooperate, it seems. If you're Opec, that means asking non-members, such as Russia to join in with curbing production. It must be said that the prospects of any co-operation from outside Opec are weak at the best of times. But it has got harder in the last decade. The surge in US shale oil means it is much more difficult to manage the market without American co-operation, which would never be forthcoming. The US government wouldn't want to work with Opec, and in any case private companies are the ones taking the decisions. They will cut if it makes commercial sense to them and their shareholders. 'Future at risk' The Opec secretary-general said all major producers should agree on methods to reduce stockpiles and thus help prices recover. ""The current environment is putting this future at risk. At current price levels, it is clear that not all of the necessary future investment is viable,"" Mr al-Badri said. Prices briefly fell to less than $28 a barrel earlier this month. HSBC has lowered its forecast for the average price of Brent crude in 2016 from $60 to $45 a barrel, while UniCredit lowered it from $52.50 to $37 a barrel. The prospect of Opec members cutting production remains unlikely. Indonesia's Opec representative said that only one member of the cartel supported calling an emergency meeting to discuss ways of boosting oil prices. The chairman of Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil giant, said on Monday that prices would ultimately rise to a moderate level as global demand increased. The Iraqi government said on Monday that oil output reached a record high in December, producing as much as 4.13m barrels a day. Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, said: ""The news that Iraq has probably hit another record builds on the oversupply sentiment. The oversupply will keep markets depressed and prices low."" Iran, which has the world's fourth-biggest oil reserves, is also preparing to resume exports now that sanctions have been lifted. A fall in the number of oil rigs in the United States, one of Opec's biggest production rivals, could reduce output, with Goldman Sachs predicting a decline of 95,000 barrels per day this year. Analysts at Energy Aspects said global oil inventories would continue to rise in the next few months, but should start to decline by the summer.","Oil prices tumbled again on Monday, eroding last week's gains, as Opec called for co-operation from oil-producing nations outside the cartel."
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter The biggest hurdles are still to come, and could stand in the way of a second phase agreement - one that would in theory remove all of the tariffs, bringing some much needed relief for the global economy, which is in the interests of all of us. What's not in the phase one deal tells us where the flashpoints are in the US-China relationship - and what could derail the second round of negotiations. So what didn't make it into the agreement? 1. Industrial subsidies and 'Made in China 2025' The deal doesn't address Beijing's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' programme, which is designed to help Chinese companies excel and become world-class leaders in emerging technologies. It also doesn't address the subsidies that China gives its state-owned enterprises, says Paul Triolo of the Eurasia Group. Washington sees ""Made in China 2025"" as a direct threat to its supremacy in tech, saying that Chinese companies have only caught up with American ones - at times outpacing them - because they get unfair and outsized assistance from the Chinese government in the form of subsidies. These were amongst the thorniest issues the Trump administration had with China, but they've been pushed to the phase two process Mr Triolo says, along with ""market access in sectors such as cloud services, cyber security and data governance issues"". Beijing maintains it doesn't unfairly subsidise these industries or companies, but the reality is China isn't going to give up dominance in these sectors so easily. 2. Huawei The trade deal won't reduce US pressure on Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant that has been caught in the crossfire of the trade war, with the US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin saying the company isn't a ""chess piece"" in the negotiations. That will disappoint both Huawei and the Chinese government which have been furious over how Washington has linked the company's fate to the relationship between the US and China. The Chinese firm became a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry and Washington has been lobbying its allies - including the UK - to not use Huawei's 5G technology services in critical communications infrastructure, alleging it could be used by Beijing to spy on customers. Huawei has denied this and had hoped that if the US-China relationship improved, its fortunes would too. Analysts tell me that's unlikely. With the signing of this agreement, there's a clear separation between national security and trade, and Huawei and other Chinese companies should still expect the pressure on them to continue. So expect more American export bans not just on Huawei, but on several more Chinese companies and increased US scrutiny on Chinese investments abroad. 3. Access for foreign financial services firms While the agreement does talk about opening up market access for financial services firms, some analysts have said it doesn't go far enough to ensure they have equal market access. China had already publicly said that it was opening up its financial services sector, and has recently allowed foreign companies to have a bigger stake in Chinese firms. But Beijing isn't giving up much by doing that, because China's financial services sector is now dominated by domestic digital payment players. Even if US payment firms do have greater market access to the Chinese market, it's hard to see how they might be able to compete. Whether China sincerely applies its commitments to treat foreign and domestic firms equally will also be watched closely by the Trump administration, and this could be a potential area where the rapprochement could be derailed. 4. Enforcement and interpretation The deal has a dispute resolution mechanism in place, which basically requires China - once a complaint has been made - to begin consultations with the US, with the onus on Beijing to resolve it. But what the deal leaves out is ""how the US is going to monitor enforcement,"" says Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute. ""American firms don't like to report intellectual property theft,"" he told me.""So in the first instance what mechanism is the US using to gather information on this. All that is in the document is consultations."" The deal also leaves out how the two sides will interpret these key aspects of the agreement. Already, there are signs of differences. Chinese state media has suggested the dispute resolution mechanism isn't dictated by the US - not entirely in keeping with Washington's messaging. This could indicate that even though there is an agreement in place, Beijing might ignore it, as Dan Harris of the China Law blog points out. ""The problem isn't the law,"" he says. ""It's that when something is important to China - some cutting edge technology that it wants - then those laws don't have any use at all."" 5. Further reductions in tariffs The deal doesn't include a definitive timeline on when the tariffs that are still in place will go down. According to research from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, average tariffs on both sides are still up about 20% from pre-trade war levels - six times higher than when the dispute began. That means companies and consumers are still paying more. Admittedly, the Trump administration has left the threat of tariffs in place as a stick to beat China with - in case Beijing doesn't keep to its commitments. And there's always that risk, as China's hard line Communist Party mouth-piece the Global Times points out: ""Can a preliminary trade agreement, reached during a period when China-US strategic relations are clearly declining, really work? Will it be replaced by new conflicts or further progress as negotiations continue?"" The potential for trade tensions to resume on both sides is still a very big possibility.","The US and China have finally - after almost two years of hostilities - signed a ""phase one"" deal. But it only covers the easier aspects of their difficult relationship, and only removes some of the tariffs."
"The expected benefit-cost ratio (BRC) has fallen from £2.50 to £2.30 in benefits for every pound spent. That fall is mainly due to a £10bn rise in the scheme's projected £42.6bn cost, which was added earlier this year. The report is the latest update on questions such as who benefits and by how much. It also has revised an earlier assumption that business people do not get much work done on trains, a view that was widely criticised at the time. The new study has cut by one-third the value put on saving an hour's worth of time getting between meetings or workplaces on a quicker train, to reflect that productive work is also done while travelling. Closures BBC transport correspondent Richard Westcott says the new report is an attempt to shift the focus away from a controversial assumption of people not working on trains, and towards the benefits of providing lots of extra capacity on the rail network. One part of the report, which came out a day earlier, argued that the alternative to HS2 would mean 14 years of route closures and longer journeys. A study, prepared by Network Rail and the management consultancy Atkins for the government, said that without the project, there would have to be 2,770 weekend closures on the East Coast, West Coast and Midland main lines for the same intended capacity of HS2. This could lead to travel times between London and Leeds doubling. 'Play politics' Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said without the new line, the West Coast, East Coast and Midland Main Lines were likely to be overwhelmed. He said it would also bring benefits for regional and commuter services, as well as increasing the amount of freight that could be carried by rail. But he warned it needed broad political consensus or it would end in nothing: ""You can't play politics with our prosperity. The new North-South line is a multi-billion, multi-year investment in the future of Britain."" Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: ""We must address the capacity problems that mean thousands of commuters face cramped, miserable journeys into cities like Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and London. But there can be no blank cheque and ministers must get a grip on costs."" Penny Gaines from the Stop HS2 organisation said: ""The big flaw in the government's argument is that phase one of HS2 won't open to the travelling public until about 2027, meaning there would be no change for passengers until the middle of the next decade. ""But building HS2 would cause years of disruption at [London] Euston, and other places on the rail network as well as chaos along the route of HS2, with roads being diverted during the build and in some places permanently shut.""",The government's latest business case for the HS2 high-speed rail link has slightly lowered the amount of benefit it predicts relative to the cost.
"The world's biggest airline said the cuts, on top of voluntary departures and leave, would leave its workforce 30% smaller than it was in March. Other carriers have warned of similarly large cuts amid a slump in air travel. United last month said as many as 36,000 jobs were at risk. Germany's Lufthansa has warned it may cut 22,000 positions, while British Airways is slashing 12,000 jobs. The reductions come amid warnings that the impact of the pandemic will cause airline losses of more than $84bn (£64bn) globally this year. In the US, the terms of a $25bn (£19bn) government bailout barred airlines from making significant job cuts before 30 September. While airlines have called for further support, talks in Washington about an aid package collapsed this month without a deal. American had received $5.8bn from the payroll aid programme. It recently announced plans to suspend service to 15 smaller airports in the US due to low travel demand. ""We must prepare for the possibility that our nation's leadership will not be able to find a way to further support aviation professionals and the service we provide, especially to smaller communities,"" chief executive Doug Parker and president Robert Isom said in a message to staff. In the letter, executives said they expected American to be flying at about 50% capacity in the final three months of 2020. International flights are expected to be reduced to 25% of 2019 levels. American said it expected fewer than 100,000 people to be working in October, down from 140,000 at the beginning of March. In addition to the 19,000 cuts, about 12,500 people have voluntarily left the airline since March. Another 11,000 will be on voluntary leave in October.","American Airlines has said it will cut 19,000 jobs in October when a government wage support scheme extended to airlines during the pandemic comes to an end."
"Following speculation at the weekend, it said it was ""reviewing all strategic options"" including the potential sale of the firm. It adds, though, there is no certainty an offer will be made for the company. Sports Direct and House of Fraser owner Mike Ashley has a 27% stake in the chain, which is 40% owned by founder Stephen Marks. French Connection, which has made a loss for each of the five most recent years, also sells homewares and perfumes. It owns the brands Great Plains and YMC and formerly owned upmarket fashion label Nicole Farhi, with whose eponymous owner he had a close partnership. The company's customers are aged between 18 and 35. It has almost 400 stores in 50 countries around the world, 130 of them in the UK. French Connection's statement confirmed speculation previously reported by Sky News. Last year, the firm appointed two new independent directors after facing pressure from investors to make top-level changes. Mr Marks, who founded the company 50 years ago, is both chairman and chief executive, a concentration of power that is frowned upon by UK investors. He has been sharply criticised for having too much control over the board. Who is Stephen Marks? Born in 1946 in Harrow, North London, his father was a hairdresser. His first fashion job was at Louis Feraud, whose clothes were worn by Brigitte Bardot. After starting on his own in the late 1960s, he had some success with a consignment of hot pants and then French Connection, launched on the back of a consignment of cheesecloth shirts. He was a successful schoolboy tennis player, winning a prize at Junior Wimbledon. He founded the fc** tennis academy which helped the careers of British players, including Jo Durie and Elena Baltacha. He has backed Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch: both films featured French Connection clothing. In another British gangster film, Layer Cake, a mocked-up French Connection-branded range of cocaine and ecstasy was featured. Stephen Marks was the film's executive producer French Connection often shortens its name to fcuk, which it launched as an advertising slogan in 1997. Its campaign ran under the line ""fcuk fashion"" and then, ""fcuk advertising"", but it had to tone it down after numerous complaints were made to advertising watchdogs. The controversy was so great that the UK's Advertising Standards Authority asked to see all the company's poster campaigns in advance.",Shares in struggling fashion chain French Connection have risen 25% to 55p after it said it may be up for sale.
"The airline, which resisted worker representation for years, is also expected to extend union recognition to cabin crew. Last month Ryanair agreed to recognise a union for its 600 UK pilots. That followed a row over pilots' rotas which saw thousands of flights cancelled. Ryanair also said that it expects fares to fall 3% this year. In a trading update the airline said profits for the three months to the end of December had risen 12% to €106m (£93.6m), while passenger numbers rose by 6% in the period to 30.4 million. Ryanair said: ""As we finalise union discussions along similar lines to that agreed in the UK, we expect some localised disruptions and adverse PR so investors should be prepared for same."" It said that once that process had been completed, it expected to have ""similar engagement with cabin crew unions"". But Ryanair said that during the process, unions at other airlines could spark trouble: ""In certain jurisdictions, unions representing competitor airlines will wish to test our commitment to our low cost, high pay/high productivity model to disrupt our operations. ""We are fully prepared to face down any such disruption if it means defending our cost base or our high productivity model."" 'Considerable uncertainty' Ryanair said it was still expecting profits for the full-year to be between €1.4bn and €1.45bn, but it said that that depended on three things: the absence of union disruptions, unforeseen security events and the level of Easter bookings. It also warned that there was considerable uncertainty about the future direction of fares and that, unlike its competitors, it was not confident that it could increase ticket prices this summer. It said cost pressures would rise, including higher fuel bills and a further €100m in staff costs thanks to a pay rise of 20% for its pilots. It added that a lack of clarity on Brexit continued to cloud its business outlook. It repeated its warning that there was ""a worrying risk of serious disruption"" to flights between the UK and the European Union from April 2019 unless there was some sort of agreement in advance of September 2018.","Ryanair is warning of ""localised disruptions"" as it recognises unions across the countries it operates in."
"From April, rates will rise in line with the lower Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, not the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The move is worth £2.3bn to businesses over the next five years, Chancellor Philip Hammond said. But Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said ""more remains to be done"". He said the chancellor's decision would lessen the impact of rate rises on hard-pressed firms, but that wider questions remained over Brexit. ""Businesses will expect greater boldness from the chancellor - and more radical support for infrastructure and investment - once a Brexit transition period is secured,"" he said. In his Budget speech, Mr Hammond said the move would help the UK's 5.5 million small businesses - which he said showed ""extraordinary vibrancy and resilience"" but ""are feeling under pressure right now"". Business rates, a property tax based on rental values, were due to go up next year in line with September's RPI of 3.9%, while CPI was 3% that month. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, which campaigned for the switch alongside the BCC, said the move to CPI was ""hugely welcome and positive"". She said: ""It's clear that the chancellor has listened to the retail industry and the growing chorus from across business and commercial life who have spoken up in favour of action to mitigate rising rates bills. ""Crucially, this relief will unleash investment that retailers want to direct towards the needs of their customers."" 'Staircase tax' Mr Hammond also promised a change in the law that led earlier this year to companies receiving much higher rates bills if their offices were in communal blocks and spread over several floors or separated by corridors shared with other occupiers. A Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a single business space meant that small businesses using multiple spaces in a building were billed for rates as if they were separate premises. The higher charges were also backdated. The Federation of Small Businesses said the end of what was dubbed ""the staircase tax"" would ""throw a lifeline to thousands of small firms that had no time to prepare for this completely unfair and retrospective levy"". Mr Hammond said the change in the law would also be backdated, to compensate firms for the extra charges. Revaluations The two measures will help ease the impact of higher business rates, which rose sharply for many firms in April this year. The change in rates reflected the first adjustment of rateable property values for seven years. Retailers in city centres where property prices have risen most, were hardest hit, on top of challenges from the weaker pound affecting the cost of importing goods and increasing competition from online retailers. Mr Hammond said from now on revaluations would take place every three years, rather than the planned five-year period. The move to bring forward the linking business rates to the lower measure of inflation will mean bills are lower than they would have been over the next two years. According to Deloitte, a business in a London office block with a rateable value of £5.9m, would pay £3.07m in rates next year instead of £3.09m due to the change. A typical shop in Manchester's Trafford Centre, with a rateable value of £347,500, would pay £171,000 instead of £172,700. Gerry Biddle, director of business rates at Deloitte Real Estate, said the announcement ""will be welcomed by hard-pressed business occupiers"". Mr Hammond also said he would also extend a £1,000 discount on business rates for small pubs for another year until March 2019. It applies to pubs with a rateable value of less than £100,000.",A planned cut to business rate rises in England has been brought forward by two years to 2018 by the chancellor.
"Associated British Foods said it opened 16 new outlets for the discount fashion chain in the UK, Europe and the US last year. It predicts total sales for Primark will jump 11% in the six months to 4 March. There were no signs UK consumers were reducing their spending, AB Foods said. Finance director John Bason said: ""The consumer in the UK has got more disposable income this year than they had a year ago - fact."" AB Foods said Primark in the UK was performing well and expected like-for-like sales to be up 2% for the six-month period, but be flat for the business as a whole. The chain will open new stores in London, Belgium, Spain and the US over the next three months. However, the company warned the weak pound could squeeze margins at Primark, which accounts for about half its profits. Sterling has fallen 16% against the US dollar since the EU referendum last June and 10% against the euro, making imports to the UK more expensive. Kate Ormrod, senior analyst at GlobalData said Primark's keen pricing gave it some protection, but added: ""Ensuring product ranges remain fashionable and relevant will be imperative to retain appeal. ""This is particularly important as emerging players such as boohoo.com and Missguided continue to encroach on Primark's fast fashion USP, enabling them to steal customers and share."" AB Foods, which also owns brands including Twining tea and Kingsmill bread, said it expects ""excellent progress"" in group profits and its outlook for the full year was unchanged. In November, chief executive George Weston said the pound's fall would bring ""benefits and challenges"" to the group. ABF said Twinings and Ovaltine revenues were well ahead of last year, with Twinings winning market share in the US, Australia and France as well as the UK. Ovaltine sales posted good growth in the developing markets of Vietnam and Brazil. Higher sugar prices and increased production in Africa helped boost revenue at AB's sugar business. Shares in AB Foods were flat at £26.09 in afternoon trading in London but have fallen more than a fifth over the past 12 months.",The owner of Primark expects profits to keep rising as it continues to open more stores.
"The firm said the number of shares to be offered and the price range had not yet been determined. However, sources told Reuters that the IPO would take place in the first half of next year. Lyft's main rival, Uber, is also expected to float next year. Lyft was launched in 2012 by technology entrepreneurs John Zimmer and Logan Green, three years after Uber was founded. It remains the smaller company, with a limited international presence. The firm is thought to be worth about $15bn (£11.75bn), while Uber is valued at about $120bn. However, Lyft's profile has risen over the last two years, as its larger rival was hit by controversy surrounding its aggressive corporate culture and data collection practices. Lyft now accounts for almost 30% of rideshare revenues in the US, up from about 23% at the start of 2017, according to research firm Second Measure. The firm reportedly earned more than $1bn in revenue in 2017, although it continues to be loss-making. ""The initial public offering is expected to commence after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,"" Lyft said.",Ride-hailing firm Lyft has moved closer to listing its shares on the stock market by filing paperwork with US authorities for an initial public offering (IPO).
"By Tim BowlerBusiness reporter, BBC News Last year, when Beyonce came to the UK with her Formation world tour it took seven Boeing 747 air freighters and a fleet of more than 70 trucks to get her stage set and other gear to the venues. And that didn't include the backstage staff, musicians, performers - or Beyonce herself. ""It was the biggest move we've ever done,"" says Martin Corr, the managing director of rock and roll transport firm Sound Moves. More firms are choosing to use air freight to get their goods to market, from diamonds to car parts, even though it is six times more expensive than sending them by sea - and rock superstars depend on it too. While air freight makes up just 1% of UK imports and exports in terms of tonnage shipped, it accounts for 40% of imports and exports in terms of their value. In the UK, Heathrow Airport is the dominant player in this trade with £101bn worth of goods passing through in a year. That's more than the value of goods passing through the country's biggest container ports, Felixstowe and Southampton, combined. Despite air cargo's expense, using planes instead of ships cuts down dramatically on the time it takes to get goods to market. ""We use Heathrow for most of our air freight. It is close to London, has great road connections, frequent flights and capacity,"" says Martin Corr. Sound Moves - based in west London close to Heathrow's cargo terminal - is one of the biggest logistics firms in the music industry with an annual turnover of £17m. Over the past 20 years they have worked with everyone from David Bowie and the Rolling Stones to Lady Gaga and now Beyonce. ""I left school with little or no qualifications, and was living with my parents lying on the sofa when my mum told me to go out and get a job,"" says Martin. ""Living in west London, Heathrow airport was the obvious place."" After working with a general freight company learning his trade, he then moved into the specialised business of moving rock groups and their equipment. In 1996 he started Sound Moves with two colleagues. Martin himself is an AC/DC fan, and an Angus Young Gibson guitar signed by all the members of the band takes pride of place in his office. ""But no I don't play it, I never wanted to be a musician,"" he says. ""I am a freight-forwarder through and through - it's what I do."" Inside his warehouse, he points out the pallets of sound equipment and music merchandise ready to be shipped anywhere in the world. ""You can be in London on a Monday and doing a show in Los Angeles on a Wednesday or Thursday. ""We used to have a very seasonal business that was busy up to Christmas, and then from Easter to September with the summer festivals, but now artists tour 12 months a year."" Touring is what brings in the merchandise and ticket sales, he says, ""and that gets the guys on the road and that's where we come in, we support them on the road"".

When Beyonce arrived last year, Sound Moves had to use Doncaster and Prestwick airports rather than Heathrow due to the London airport's lack of flexibility. ""It was a rush to get the aircraft unloaded. There's lots of draws on an artist's time. They still want to be seen by the public but in the shortest possible time,"" he says. The fact that Sound Moves couldn't use Heathrow for Beyonce's tour is significant, says Nick Platts, head of cargo at Heathrow Airport. ""I remember having chats with Martin over several days working out how we could help him, but we couldn't offer him the flexibility he needed."" The airport is working at almost maximum capacity and he says there is little room for further growth in cargo traffic. ""We are pushing traffic away from us. ""We need to expand and build a third runway just to satisfy the pent-up demand that is out there, let alone cope with future growth,"" he says. Both Heathrow and Gatwick are seeing an increase in the amount of air freight they handle - but Gatwick's growth rate is significantly higher. ""Our booming long-haul routes have driven a huge cargo increase,"" says Gatwick Airport's chief executive officer, Stewart Wingate. Perhaps surprisingly only a fraction of air cargo is actually carried in specialised air freighters. Most of it - 95% at Heathrow - is carried in the bellies of passenger aircraft and that can boost an airline's revenues between 5-20%. ""Take that away and the route may not be viable,"" says Heathrow's Nick Platts. ""The reason Heathrow is successful is not because we are moving people - it is because we are moving car parts, Scottish salmon, blood plasma products and other medicines, jewellery and precious stones. That is what air freight is good for,"" he says. Back at Sound Moves, Martin Corr is getting ready for U2's Joshua Tree tour. ""It's all planned and organised, they'll be coming into the UK by air over one weekend in July - it's a very tight schedule."" He's keen to dispel any idea that his industry is glamorous. ""We don't get to hang out at backstage parties or fly on private jets, that's not what we do. ""For us there is no day off until the tour is over."" Mind you, he does keep one bottle of champagne in his office fridge. ""Well it wouldn't be rock and roll without champagne, would it?"" he laughs.

"It suggests a free door-to-door assessment programme for households, that would identify remedial works required for every house to meet minimum energy efficiency standards. It says this would save households between £300 and £600 each year. Low-income households would receive the work for free, while others would be granted an interest-free loan. Unison says the UK is ""reaching crisis point with dwindling gas supplies"", and adds that, within the next five years, the country will need to import up to 70% of gas from abroad. Protests The report comes in the wake of the Queen's Speech this month where the government confirmed it would press ahead with legislation that would allow fracking companies to run shale gas lines through private property without permission. The fracking process involves pumping water, sand and chemicals into rock at high pressure, and it has sparked demonstrations by environmentalists. Some governments have banned the process. Critics argue that fracking contaminates water supplies and can cause earthquakes. There have been strong anti-fracking protests at Balcombe, West Sussex, against test-drilling. Unison's general secretary, Dave Prentis, said: ""The government must take action to bring millions of households in from the cold. Unless the government invests in a long-term strategy to preserve our dwindling North Sea gas supplies, we will be relying on expensive imported energy and wide scale fracking for shale gas."" It claims the UK has the oldest housing stock in the European Union, with older houses requiring at least twice as much energy to stay warm as homes in similar developed nations.",The union Unison is proposing an energy review of homes which it says will save money and reduce the need for fracking.
"By Jamie RobertsonBusiness reporter, BBC News If not then you need to ask for more, and that means you have to negotiate with the person who pays your wages. It's something that puts the frighteners on a lot of people. It shouldn't. ""No one ever got fired for asking for a pay rise"" said Pip Jamieson founder of the professional networking site, The Dots. ""In fact rather the opposite - asking for more money shows ambition and shows you want to stay with the company."" But there are good ways of asking for a pay rise and there are bad ones. So here are some dos and don'ts when it comes to asking for a bigger salary. DO: Research properly Go to a salary comparison website or talk to a recruitment agency or your Human Resources department (HR) to find out the kind of pay your job should be getting. You need hard evidence to back your pay rise - sales targets reached, contracts signed, goals met. Remember, it's surprising how little the person who decides your salary, especially in a big organisation, may know about what you do. ""Work at it,"" says Dulcie Shepherd Swanston, author of It's Not Bloody Rocket Science and founder of the business training company Profitably Engaged. ""The sort of qualities you need for getting a pay rise are the same sort of qualities you need for being a good employee."" DON'T: Randomly demand more money Tessa Fyson had been working in the NHS for six months when she decided to ask for more money. ""When I got asked the inevitable question, 'Why should we give you a pay rise?' - I froze!"" she said. ""Any type of meeting with management can make you nervous and I lost all ability to speak. It made me feel and look incredibly naïve and I was told to think of the reasons why and then come back."" Ms Jamieson insists employees should see pay as a commercial contract, not a favour, which should be negotiated seriously. So you should not argue that you need the money to pay the rent or buy Prada handbags on a monthly basis. But Lou Goodman, marketing director at the employment website Monster for the UK, Ireland and Benelux cautions: ""It's always worthwhile for a company being empathetic about your personal life, because if they lose an employee, the resources needed to find, recruit and train up someone new can be considerable. ""But in the end, pay should reflect someone's performance and the performance of the company itself."" DO: Pick a good time Choose a moment when everyone is in a good mood say, after the (successful) completion of a project. Find out when your company plans its budget, so you can be sure you aren't asking for the impossible. ""You have to be savvy,"" said Ms Shepherd. ""You have to be talking to your boss three to four months before the next salary review."" DON'T: Ask for a pay rise too quickly If your last salary increase was within the last year or you are new to the job, you are going to have to come up with some pretty good reasons why you need another so soon. ""Too many people start a new job and then want a pay rise. This baffles me as the job was accepted with the offering,"" says Charlotte Green, a personal development coach at Specific Learning and Coaching. ""A pay rise is due for loyalty and time. Hard work will reap financial rewards"" DO: Make sure you are in the right pay grade Increasingly companies are structuring their pay into bands, reducing the need for individual negotiations. ""For employers it is very useful to have a structure. If you don't and you start paying different people different amounts for doing the same job, you can get into hot water very quickly,"" explains Ms Swanston. DON'T: Ask for something outside your pay grade ""You're being naive if you ask for more,"" said Ms Swanston. ""All the same you can still be curious about your pay grade. There might be a mistake, or there might be a good reason why you should be at a different level from the one you're in."" However, Ms Goodman said that although pay bands may limit how much you can ask for, they do have advantages: ""There can still be a wide range of movement within a pay band, It's actually quite useful as it provides a framework for negotiations and gives you benchmarks you can measure yourself against."" DO: Be confident The Monster website advises employees to ""sit up straight, make eye contact with your boss. Confidence is key in this conversation, so speak slowly and deliberately, and use hand gestures to reinforce your points if this is your natural style."" Ms Fyson said one of the most important tips she took away from her time at the NHS was: ""Be confident! We all do more than our job description ever tells us to do but it is okay to want the money reward as well."" DON'T: Fidget, giggle nervously or allow your gaze to wander around the room or cover your mouth while speaking Monster says this all suggests to the person on the other side of the desk that you are uncomfortable or insecure about what you're asking for. It also says you should try not to fill in any silences or go off on a ramble. Just wait for a response and put the onus onto your manager to respond. DO: Ask for an exact sum It may seem counterintuitive but research at Columbia Business School finds that asking for a specific and precise salary works better than a rounded up figure. The researchers placed ""negotiators"" in scenarios such as buying jewellery or negotiating the sale of a used car. Some made precise offers, other made rounded up offers. Overall people offering a precise amount were seen to be more informed about the true value of the item for sale. One of the authors of the 2013 report, Professor Malia Mason, said: ""The practical application of these findings — signalling that you are informed and using a precise number — can be used in any negotiation situation to imply you've done your homework,"" DON'T: Be vague ""Negotiators should remember that in this case, zeros really do add nothing to the bargaining table,"" said Professor Mason. But bear in mind if you ask for a £1,245.25 pay rise you may have to explain what's so important about the 25p - or the £245. DO: Talk about the future ""There's more to work than just pay,"" says Ms Jamieson. ""There are other things that affect your happiness at work - flexible working, holidays, perks. These are all things you should talk about."" Tessa Fyson eventually got her pay rise at the NHS and after several years moved to a career in marketing for a recruitment firm. Again she tried for a pay rise and this time was better prepared. What her employers offered wasn't what she had asked for, but there were other benefits: ""They came back able to offer a small increase each time I hit my quarterly targets,"" she said, ""and a promotion in job title. It may not have been exactly what I was looking for but the fact they were trying to support me meant a lot."" DON'T: Give up ""If they didn't want to give you more money now and they don't think that's your value, ask what will increase your value and what you have to do. That sort of feedback is very useful indeed and lays the groundwork for the next discussion,"" says Ms Shepherd. And of course you can always leave. ""When you are negotiating,"" Ms Jamieson points out, ""the threat to leave is always implied. You don't need to spell it out, and the best thing for you is that it is a sellers' market. The best companies are getting the best talent by offering more, and that's the way it should be.""",How much are you worth? Or rather - is the answer to that question equal to the sum paid into your bank account by your employer?
"It said it had delayed paying corporation tax due to investments in its infrastructure amounting to £1bn a year between 2010 and 2015. ""The government's tax system allows us to delay, not avoid, payment of tax based on how much we invest,"" it said. The firm increased bills by 6.7% last year. Thames Water's tax payments were detailed in its results for the year to the end of March, showing that pre-tax profits had fallen 35% due to bad weather as well as a rise in unpaid bills. It said revenues rose 6% to £1.8bn. Operating profits, which strip out exceptional items were £549m for the year. The figures come in the wake of criticism by Jonson Cox, chairman of water industry watchdog Ofwat, who said the tax-reducing corporate structures of some water companies were ""morally questionable"". ""Tax policy is not for an economic regulator and these structures may be legal and common in private equity. But some aspects are morally questionable in a vital public service,"" Mr Cox wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph. Thames Water, which is privately owned, said it had contributed around £150m in other taxes, including central and local government business rates, PAYE and national insurance. ""We currently have nearly £1bn of deferred tax on our balance sheet,"" it added. Thames Water serves London, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, Kent, Oxfordshire, Surrey and Wiltshire and has 14 million customers.","Thames Water, the UK's biggest water firm, paid no corporation tax this financial year despite making £145m in pre-tax profit."
"The Asia-focused lender said pre-tax profits fell to $1.5bn (£930m) in the July-to-September quarter compared to the same period a year ago. Standard Chartered also warned full-year earnings would fall because of weak trading activity. It also plans to cut an additional $400m in costs for 2015. Standard Chartered chief executive Peter Sands, who has run the firm since 2006, said ""trading conditions remain subdued"". ""We are executing our refreshed strategy, including reprioritising investments, exiting non-core businesses, de-risking certain portfolios and reallocating capital,"" he said in a statement. ""We also continue to make progress in reshaping Korea. Whilst some of these actions will impact near term performance, they are crucial to getting us back to a trajectory of sustainable, profitable growth"". Market challenges Mr Sands has been under pressure over the lender's weak performance over the last two years, which it attributes to a ""challenging"" market environment. Standard Chartered shares have lost 20% of their value this year in London, compared to a 5% decline in the benchmark FTSE 100 index. The lender makes about three-quarters of its profit in Asia but a slowdown in many emerging markets have hurt growth. ""We remain watchful in India, in China and of commodity exposures more broadly, where we have continued to tighten our underwriting criteria and reduce our exposures,"" it said. Standard Chartered has also been facing heavy scrutiny from regulators.

"The company behind Crossrail made a £117m pre-tax profit in 2017, up from just £10m the previous year. The rise follows several years of big losses after Balfour's business became overly complex. Chief executive Leo Quinn said it had only narrowly avoided the fate of rival Carillion by reforming its business. Carillion, the construction outsourcing giant, fell into administration in January under under a debt pile of £1.5bn. Mr Quinn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We had our own near-death experience three years ago - eight profit warnings, £600m cash outflow in nine months from the company. ""These results today demonstrate an amazing transformation and turnaround."" In the year to 31 December, Balfour's underlying profits doubled to £196m, although revenue fell slightly to £6.9bn. Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital, said the firm's profits were slightly below expectations but its higher margins were paying off. ""Margins are what matter and today's results continue the positive trajectory evident in the [firm's] December trading update."" Balfour, which is working on the Thames Tideway Tunnel and HS2, ran into trouble in 2014 after more than a decade of acquisition-led growth. However, Mr Quinn said over the last three years the firm had ""upgraded"" its leadership and simplified its structure, selling off its Middle Eastern and Indonesian operations. In its results, the firm suffered a one-off loss of £44m on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route project contract as a result of Carillion's liquidation. Balfour Beatty and its remaining joint venture partner on the project, Galliford Try, are obliged to complete work on the 58km dual carriageway. However, Mr Quinn said Balfour had also benefited from Carillion's failure, as it had removed a ""major competitor from the market that was underpricing us all"". Major competitor Balfour has taken on 150 of Carillion's employees, who had worked with the firm on joint venture projects. Mr Quinn said he blamed Carillion's collapse on a failure of leadership: ""If you are driving the car and not looking at the gauges in front of you, and not understanding what's going on with your petrol and your speedometer, you're not actually doing the job you are paid to do."" He also said the government - a key customer to Carillion - needed to change the way it procured infrastructure projects and should ""pre-qualify"" suppliers on the quality of their balance sheet. ""There is a real structural issue here. Fundamentally, the government gives very little credence to the quality of your balance sheet,"" Mr Quinn said. ""You could be bidding against two men and a white van, and it's almost seen as a level playing field. ""It's quite clear that can't continue, and buying at the lowest price doesn't actually mean you get delivered what you think you bought.""","Britain's biggest construction firm, Balfour Beatty, has posted a big jump in annual profit as its turnaround continues."
"It said online trading had been hit by tougher regulation and ""the worst Cheltenham results in recent history"". It now expects full-year operating profit to be between £260m and £280m, down from £291.4m last year. As a result, the FTSE 250 company saw its shares drop nearly 40p to 331p. However, the benchmark FTSE 100 ended flat, up 6.4 points at 6199.1. Top riser on the FTSE 100 was B&Q owner Kingfisher. Its shares finished up 6% despite reporting a 20% drop in full-year profits to £512m. However, when restructuring costs were stripped out, underlying profits were a better-than-expected £686m. William Hill William Hill said there were two main factors behind the weaker-than-expected performance from its online business. It said it had seen ""an acceleration in the number of time-outs and automatic self-exclusions over recent weeks"", measures which allow punters to halt gambling with a bookmaker. William Hill said that while the trend was ""still evolving, we estimate that, should these trends persist around current levels, the consequent lower revenues will reduce online's profits by £20-25m in 2016"". Secondly, its profit margins were lower than expected because of European football results and last week's Cheltenham horseracing festival, where bookmakers were hit by large a number of favourites winning races. William Hill said that despite its online problems, the broader group continued ""to trade well"" and was in line with expectations. The company also said it was in ""advanced discussions"" to invest in Openbet, a gaming software firm. Sterling weak Elsewhere on the London market, shares in Sports Direct were having another bad day, down a further 5.6% after dropping about 10% on Tuesday. Earlier the retailer had issued a statement saying that it expected full-year underlying earnings to be ""at or around the bottom"" of a previously estimated range. The statement was issued following comments that founder Mike Ashley made to the Times newspaper on Tuesday. On the currency markets, the pound remained weak after having fallen sharply on Tuesday in the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels, which were seen as increasing the likelihood of the UK voting to leave the EU. On Wednesday, sterling fell almost 1% against the dollar to $1.4087. Against the euro, it lost 0.4% to €1.2623.",(Close): William Hill shares closed down more than 11% after the bookmaker warned on profits.
"GoCompare, said it had ""unanimously and unequivocally"" rejected the unsolicited offer from the Zoopla and uSwitch owner. GoCompare shares jumped 10% after news of the approach, while shares in ZPG edged up 0.4%, valuing it at about £1.5bn. Meanwhile, the FTSE 100 share index closed flat. Sir Peter Wood, GoCompare's chairman, said of the approach: ""ZPG's proposal is highly opportunistic and fundamentally undervalues the company and its prospects.""

"The US banking group will instead run these operations from four hubs in Singapore, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and London. It will continue to offer products to larger clients and institutions in these markets. Its chief executive Jane Fraser said it ""does not have the scale"" to compete in these 13 markets. Citigroup will shut down consumer banking operations in Australia, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. ""As a result of the ongoing refresh of our strategy, we have decided that we are going to double down on wealth. We will operate our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely from four wealth centres, Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE and London,"" Ms Fraser said in a statement. Ms Fraser took over Citi in September last year - the first woman to become chief executive of a Wall Street bank. ""While the other 13 markets have excellent businesses, we don't have the scale we need to compete,"" she added. ""We believe our capital, investment dollars and other resources are better deployed against higher returning opportunities in wealth management and our institutional businesses in Asia."" On Thursday, Citi reported net income of $7.9bn (£5.7bn) for the first three months of 2021, beating analysts' expectations. While the banking group may be exiting key markets in Asia, rivals are expanding in the region.

"The firm said in a memo to pilots that its bases at Berlin Tegel and Dusseldorf airports were also at risk of closure by the end of the summer. Airlines have been struggling because of global travel restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus. Ryanair's UK pilots and cabin crew recently voted to accept pay cuts to reduce job losses. ""We must move on with alternative measures to deliver savings, which regrettably will mean base closures and dismissals,"" Ryanair said in a memo to its German pilots. Ryanair announced in May it was set to cut 3,000 jobs across Europe. However, earlier this month, the company revealed that it had cut a deal with the Unite union so that UK cabin crew jobs would be safeguarded. Ryanair is yet to specify how many jobs will be impacted by the changes in Germany. 'Bizarre' German airline union Vereinigung Cockpit said that ""less than half of pilots were in favour of accepting"" the pay deal. ""We believe the agreement would have the potential to harm the entire pilot community across Germany,"" it said. Ryanair said the proposed cuts are based on current schedule plans, and insisted that they could become ""considerably worse"" if there is a resurgence of coronavirus. ""We made it clear throughout negotiations that if the vote was unsuccessful, then the next step would have to be dismissals,"" it said. ""It is bizarre that the union canvassed against the deal knowing full well that the result would be base closures and job losses.""",Ryanair is shutting its base at Frankfurt Hahn airport after German pilots voted to reject pay cuts.
"Mr Norman, who built his reputation as boss of Asda, will replace Robert Swannell, who joined M&S in 2010. The announcement comes days after M&S hired the boss of Halfords, Jill McDonald, to take charge of its clothing, home and beauty business. Mr Norman, former executive at retailer Kingfisher, stood down as ITV chairman last year. He joins M&S as chief executive Steve Rowe continues the fight to improve flagging clothing sales, and revamp product ranges and prices, while attempting to create a leaner and more focused business. Mr Rowe has already announced a big expansion of the M&S food operation. Mr Norman said: ""I am looking forward to taking on the role of the chairmanship of Marks & Spencer as the business under Steve Rowe's leadership faces into the considerable challenges ahead in a rapidly changing retail landscape."" Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ""Some people thought that Archie was too heavyweight for the role, which is non-executive, and it remains to be seen how much of 'a back-seat driver' he is to CEO Steve Rowe. ""When he took over at the struggling Asda in 1991 he famously played down expectations of the turnaround and we see he is up to his old tricks again in today's statement."" Mr Norman has held a number of high ranking positions, including: He has also served as chairman of Lazard London and Hobbycraft. Reputation In a statement, Mr Swannell said: ""I am delighted that Archie, with his deep, relevant experience is to be M&S's next chairman. ""It has been a real privilege to have served as chairman and to have worked with so many exceptional people who are so passionate about this great business. ""With the appointment of Steve Rowe in 2016, I am confident that we have an excellent team, well-equipped to grow and strengthen the business. I wish them all the very best for the future."" Mr Norman has a reputation for turning around businesses. He is most famously credited with transforming Asda, which was ailing at the beginning of the 1990s but was sold for £6.5bn to Wal-Mart in 1999. In interviews he admitted that it meant tough decisions, such as salary freezes and thousands of redundancies. Last year, he was appointed lead non-executive director at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Investors reacted positively to Mr Norman's appointment, sending shares in the retailer up more than 5%.",Retail veteran and former Conservative MP Archie Norman has been named Marks and Spencer's new chairman.
"It follows complaints - including from Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak - that algorithms used to set limits might be inherently biased against women. New York's Department of Financial Services (DFS) has contacted Goldman Sachs, which runs the Apple Card. Any discrimination, intentional or not, ""violates New York law"", the DFS said. The Bloomberg news agency reported on Saturday that tech entrepreneur David Heinemeier Hansson had complained that the Apple Card gave him 20 times the credit limit that his wife got. In a tweet, Mr Hansson said the disparity was despite his wife having a better credit score. Later, Mr Wozniak, who founded Apple with Steve Jobs, tweeted that the same thing happened to him and his wife despite their having no separate bank accounts or separate assets. Banks and other lenders are increasingly using machine-learning technology to cut costs and boost loan applications. 'Legal violation' But Mr Hansson, creator of the programming tool Ruby on Rails, said it highlights how algorithms, not just people, can discriminate. US healthcare giant UnitedHealth Group is being investigated over claims an algorithm favoured white patients over black patients. Mr Hansson said in a tweet: ""Apple Card is a sexist program. It does not matter what the intent of individual Apple reps are, it matters what THE ALGORITHM they've placed their complete faith in does. And what it does is discriminate."" He said that as soon as he raised the issue his wife's credit limit was increased. The DFS said in a statement that it ""will be conducting an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and ensure all consumers are treated equally regardless of sex"". ""Any algorithm that intentionally or not results in discriminatory treatment of women or any other protected class violates New York law."" The BBC has contacted Goldman Sachs for comment. On Saturday, the investment bank told Bloomberg: ""Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law."" The Apple Card, launched in August, is Goldman's first credit card. The Wall Street investment bank has been offering more products to consumers, including personal loans and savings accounts through its Marcus online bank. The iPhone maker markets Apple Card on its website as a ""new kind of credit card, created by Apple, not a bank"". Analysis Leo Kelion, Technology desk editor Without access to the Goldman Sachs computers, it's impossible to be certain of what is going on. The fact there appears to be a correlation between gender and credit doesn't necessarily mean one is causing the other. Even so, the suspicion is that unintentional bias has crept into the system. That could be because when the algorithms involved were developed, they were trained on a data set in which women indeed posed a greater financial risk than the men. This could cause the software to spit out lower credit limits for women in general, even if the assumption it is based on is not true for the population at large. Alternatively, the problem might lie in the data the algorithms are now being fed. For example, within married couples, men might be more likely to take out big loans solely using their name rather than having done so jointly, and the data may not have been adjusted to take this into account. A further complication is that the software involved can act as a ""black box"", coming up with judgements without providing a way to unravel how each was determined. ""There have been a lot of strides taken in the last five to six years to improve the explainability of decisions taken based on machine learning techniques,"" commented Jonathan Williams of Mk2 Consulting. ""But in some cases, it's still not as good as it could be."" In any case, for now Apple would prefer Goldman Sachs take the heat, despite the fact its marketing materials state that its card was ""created by Apple, not a bank"". But that's a tricky position to maintain. Apple's brand is the only one to feature on the minimalist styling of its card's face, and many of its consumers have higher expectations of its behaviour than they would do for other payment card providers. That means that even if issues of gender bias prove to be common across lenders, Apple faces becoming the focal point for demands that they are addressed.",A US financial regulator has opened an investigation into claims Apple's credit card offered different credit limits for men and women.
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter The Residential Landlords Association (RLA) claims the trend will mean fewer homes for rent, exacerbating the housing shortage. It claims that rents could rise as a result, particularly in London. However, Airbnb disputes the findings and denies that a growing number of its clients are landlords. In its report, the RLA says 41% of properties advertised on Airbnb in the capital are multiple listings - in other words involve one owner advertising several properties. There are particular tax advantages for landlords who rent out their properties as short-term holiday lets, rather than rent them out with long tenancy agreements. By next year, such landlords will not be able to claim tax relief on mortgage interest payments. In other cases, the RLA is concerned that landlords using Airbnb to rent out properties for more than three months may be doing so to avoid planning regulations. ""Given the pressures faced in the capital it is important that properties advertised as being available for more than 90 days a year are genuine holiday lets with appropriate planning permission,"" said RLA policy director David Smith. ""Otherwise, as well as taking rental stock off the market for those looking for somewhere to live, they are also putting tenants in a vulnerable position without all the protections offered by a tenancy agreement."" In other countries Airbnb is encountering tougher regulation. Authorities in Berlin have passed laws which limit the likes of Airbnb to renting out rooms, rather than whole flats or houses. Since doing so, rents have reportedly moderated. How affordable is rent in your area? 'Misleading research' However Airbnb said there was no evidence that those letting out properties for more than three months did not have planning permission. And while some properties may be ""available"" for longer periods, they are often actually rented out for shorter periods. ""This is misleading research that deliberately confuses availability with nights booked,"" said an Airbnb spokesperson. ""Rather than removing housing stock, hosting on Airbnb puts money in the pockets of regular Londoners and helps them afford living costs in one of the world's most expensive cities."" The RLA research suggests that as many as 21,861 London properties are now being advertised on Airbnb, a figure that rose by a quarter between February and June this year. It says that number is evidence of increasing ""commercialisation"" of the website. The RLA is also concerned that many tenants may be sub-letting flats to short-term visitors.","Landlords are taking their flats off the open market, and advertising them instead on holiday websites like Airbnb, warns an industry report."
"The Anglo-Australian commodities firm reported an annual net loss of $6.4bn (£5bn) for the year to 30 June. The global mining sector has seen years of weak demand attributed largely to slowing growth in China. BHP results were also hit by costs after the Samarco mining disaster in Brazil, which killed 19 people. The record losses come after the company had reported a $1.9bn net profit. ""While commodity prices are expected to remain low and volatile in the short to medium term, we are confident in the long-term outlook for our commodities, particularly oil and copper,"" chief executive Andrew Mackenzie said in a statement. Underlying earnings for the past year, which strip out one-off costs, came in at $1.22bn. Ongoing uncertainty The financial fallout from the Samarco mining tragedy is still not clear though warns James Butterfill, head of research & investment strategy at ETF Securities. ""There's a huge uncertainty overhang,"" he told the BBC. ""The report hasn't been published with regard to the Samarco dam collapse and there's currently a $48bn lawsuit. It's unrealistic to be that amount, but this is really BHP's Macondo well incident theoretically that BP endured."" The company also slashed its payout, setting a final dividend of 30 cents, compared with 62 cents last year. That follows BHP's decision in February to abandon its previous dividend policy, where shareholders were given gradually higher payouts. The difficult market situation led global ratings agency Standard & Poor's to downgrade BHP's rating from A+ to A earlier this year. However, with regard to the slump in the commodities market, the outlook is expected to improve. Michael McCarthy, an analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney, told the BBC: ""There are signs in the commodity prices - and in particular for iron ore and oil - that they have stabilised. ""The demand might be edging back to equilibrium again and that's good news for the longer term for BHP shareholders."" BHP Billiton is one of the world's largest producers of major commodities including iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper and uranium, and has substantial interests in both conventional and shale oil and gas and energy coal. BHP was founded in the mid-1800s in Australia, while Billiton's roots can be traced back to a tin mine in Indonesia in 1851. The Anglo-Dutch company merged with BHP in 2001 to form a global mining giant.",Mining giant BHP Billiton has reported a record loss for the past year following a mining disaster in Brazil and a slump in commodity prices.
"However, the bank said the long term impact was ""unclear"" because there was no certainty over how the UK's position outside the EU would evolve. ""The board is mindful that the future of the UK's relationship with the EU is a matter for the UK electorate, and that for many the debate is about more than just economics,"" it added. The EU vote is on 23 June. It's the first bank to speak out officially on the impact of the EU referendum vote, although in October its chairman Lord Brackwell said in the Lords there weren't ""compelling arguments"" for staying in the EU without ""significant"" reforms. He made it clear, however, that he was making the comments in a personal capacity. Other bank bosses, including RBS chief executive Ross McEwan, Barclays boss Jes Staley and HSBC's chief executive and chair Stuart Gulliver and Douglas Flint have spoken out in favour of Britain staying in the EU, although all have emphasised that they were speaking in a personal capacity. Lloyds said it had issued the statement following a board discussion earlier on Thursday, but said its view was based on ""a range of third-party economic analysis"". It said it currently had no plans to discuss it any further at their AGM. Huge risks? Lucy Thomas, deputy director of Britain Stronger In Europe, the lead campaign for the In side, said the warning from Lloyds underscored the ""huge risks to workers, savers and homeowners"" if Britain voted to leave the EU. ""Leave campaigners who think this market is 'not important' should reflect on the at least three million jobs dependent on our trade with Europe"", she said. John Longworth, chairman of the official Out campaign Vote Leave, said: ""What right do multinationals have to lecture us? ""The EU may work for the handful of large multinational banks that can afford the reams of red tape, but it will be the dynamic SMEs that will benefit if we Vote Leave on 23 June."" Lloyds' statement comes after the Bank of England earlier warned the EU referendum could hurt growth in the first half of this year as it held interest rates at 0.5%. Vote Leave last month published a list of 250 business leaders who it said supported Britain leaving the EU. The list included former HSBC chief executive Michael Geoghegan and the hotelier Sir Rocco Forte. But Britain Stronger in Europe said at the time that Vote Leave could not find a business to officially back it, as those listed supported it in a ""personal capacity"".","Lloyds Banking Group has warned a UK vote to leave the EU would cause short term ""economic uncertainty""."
"Ono, which is private equity-owned, offers cable TV and internet services and has 1.9 million customers in Spain. Vodafone boss Vittorio Colao said the deal was ""an attractive value creation opportunity"". The deal comes just six months after Vodafone bought a controlling stake in German cable operator Kabel. Vodafone has said it plans to spend up to £25bn of the £84bn it generated from the sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless on investment in its core European networks. Before the Vodafone deal, Ono's private equity owners had been planning to float the company on the Madrid stock exchange. Jose Maria Castellano Rios, chairman of Ono's board of directors, said the enlarged business would help to ""drive innovation in the Spanish telecommunications industry"". Peregrine & Black analyst Markus Huber said the deal would put Vodafone in a better position to compete with rivals such as Telefonica and Orange. ""It follows the strategy they are already pursuing in Germany and in Europe in general, which is to expand their overall offer to their clients by adding cable service to their wireless services,"" he added. Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at online broker Interactive Investor, agreed the purchase was a ""shrewd strategic move"" for Vodafone, noting that the deal would provide it with the fixed-line operation it currently lacked in Spain.","Vodafone has agreed to buy Spanish cable operator Ono for 7.2bn euros ($10bn; £6bn), in deal aimed at expanding its interests in Europe."
"The firm is accused of giving donations to several non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a confidante of President Park Geun-hye. The donations were allegedly made in exchange for political support of a controversial merger. The scandal has led to President Park being impeached last December. ""I deeply apologise to the people for failing to show a positive image because of this incident,"" Mr Lee told reporters upon arriving on Thursday morning. Earlier this week two other Samsung executives were interviewed by the special prosecutors, but were treated as witnesses rather than suspects. The claims against the company circle around a merger between the electronics giant's construction arm, Samsung C&T, and an affiliate firm, Cheil Industries. Prosecutors allege that Samsung gave €2.8m euros ($3.1m; £2.5m) to a company co-owned by Ms Choi and her daughter, in return for Ms Park's support for the deal. Lee Jae-yong, also known as Jay Y. Lee, has already given evidence to politicians over the scandal, but this is the first time he has been quizzed as a suspect by investigators. Stephen Evans, South Korea correspondent: A parade of apologies Connoisseurs of the apology will study this case for years to come. There has now been a string of important people saying they are deeply sorry, even as they profess their innocence of wrong-doing. On his way into the investigator's office, Jay Y. Lee said he was sorry for portraying a bad image. In the past, President Park said she was sorry - for being too trusting. And her mentor, Choi Soon-sil, also apologised, saying she had ""committed an unpardonable crime"". What crime that was though remains unclear - since she also said she was innocent! Incidentally, Mr Lee has a record of apologies. Four years ago, he took his son out of a school after it was revealed that the boy had a space there meant for the underprivileged (which the son of the acting-head of Samsung clearly is not - in the land where the son always rises, the lad may well end up as the head of the company himself). There will be more apologies before the current saga is over. At the parliamentary hearing in December, Samsung admitted giving a total of 20.4bn won (£16m; $17.46m) to the two foundations, but denied seeking favours. And Mr Lee also confirmed the firm gave a horse and money to help the equestrian career of Ms Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, something he said he now regretted. Mr Lee is currently vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics. But since his father, Lee Kun-hee, suffered a heart attack in 2014, he is considered de facto boss of the entire Samsung Group conglomerate. Politicians voted on 9 December to impeach President Park over the scandal - a decision South Korea's constitutional court has six months to uphold or overturn. Until then she remains formally president but stripped of her powers, which are handed to the prime minister, a presidential appointee. Ms Choi is on trial for charges including corruption and coercion. Ms Park's position began to unravel in October last year when details of her friendship with Ms Choi began to emerge. They included revelations that the president had allowed her old friend - who holds no government role - to edit political speeches. Since then, hundreds of thousands of protestors have gathered every weekend in Seoul to demand Ms Park stands down. Ms Park denies wrongdoing but has apologised for the way she managed her relationship with Ms Choi, who also denies committing criminal offences.",Samsung chief Lee Jae-yong has been questioned at the prosecutor's office in Seoul as a suspect in South Korea's biggest political corruption scandal.
"The fall came after a string of disappointing earnings reports from giants such as Apple. Strong wage growth in the latest payrolls data also spooked investors raising the possibility of higher interest rates than expected. The Dow fell more than 665 points or 2.5% to 25,520.96. The S&P 500 tumbled 59.8 points, falling 2.12% to 2,762.13, while the Nasdaq closed 144.91 points lower at 7,240.9, down 1.96%. The losses touched every sector, with the steepest declines in energy and technology stocks. Chevron and Exxon, which both reported quarterly earnings to investors on Friday, were the two biggest losers on the Dow, falling more than 5%. Apple, which reported after the close of trading on Thursday, was number four, retreating 4.3%. Stocks were also rattled as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a four-year high after Friday's payrolls report. The gain in bond yields, which come as central banks globally ease stimulus programmes and raise rates, have touched off fears that stocks could become a less attractive investment, while signalling higher borrowing costs that could crimp consumer activity. Analysts said markets may also be responding to outstanding political and policy issues, such as trade tensions with partners such as China and how tax cuts will shift corporate financial strategies. ""There are still a number of question marks on the side of fiscal policy,"" said Lindsey Piezga, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. 'Real investing activity' For the week, the Dow fell 4%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each slipped by more than 3%. Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the market declines, which follow a massive rally in 2017 that was fuelled by a strengthening global economy and high expectations for US corporate tax cuts. The three major stocks indexes also closed January up more than 5%. The Dow, which tracks about 30 major companies, in particular is not a good gauge, said Brian Barnier, head of analytics at Valuebridge Advisers. ""It's very important to separate trading activity from real investing activity,"" said Mr Barnier, who also teaches at the Colin Powell School at the City College of New York. Assuming they have well-designed portfolios, ""mom and pops sitting at home... should not be concerned, given the massive run up in the market,"" he added.","The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its steepest decline since June 2016 on Friday, amid wider losses in US markets."
"There had not been a risk of electricity supplies being disrupted, it said. National Grid earlier issued a Notification of Inadequate System Margin (NISM) as a result of multiple energy plant breakdowns. ""The market duly responded to this signal,"" the company said. The National Grid described the NISM as ""one of the routine tools that we use to indicate to the market that we would like more generation to come forward for the evening peak demand period"". An additional 500 megawatts had been requested between 16.30 and 18.30 on Wednesday. The company last issued a NISM in February 2012, and before that in 2009. When a notification is issued, generators with spare capacity can respond quickly, ramping up supply within the system. The National Grid said that if this failed to happen it had standby contracts with some gas-fired stations. It also has ""demand side management"" contracts with businesses, which allow the grid to ask them to reduce energy consumption at specified times. ""More generation came forward and about 40 MW of demand side balancing reserve was ordered so the NISM has been withdrawn,"" National Grid said. The National Grid plans to increase significantly its use of demand side management to keep the system in balance. Lower supplies Last month, the National Grid said gas supplies for the winter months were ""comfortable"", while electricity supplies were ""manageable"". It said the supply of electricity exceeded demand by 5.1%, but only after additional supplies had been secured, such as paying plants to remain on standby. This is the lowest rate in seven years. There have been some concerns expressed that the UK could suffer from blackouts as a result of short supplies, brought about in large part from the closure of a number of power stations that have come to the end of their working lives. Brian Strutton from the GMB union said: ""The UK government and National Grid are far too complacent about the risks of widespread power blackouts."" However, the National Grid and many experts have dismissed these concerns. There has been one generation-related electricity outage in the past 10 years, according to a study commissioned by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.",The UK power industry has provided more electricity generation after a request from the National Grid.
"By Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News It turns out its latest £165,000 Ghost model - which is smaller and less ostentatious than the £235,000 Phantom models - has provided the answer. During a year when the rest of the world's carmakers were fighting for customers as they tightened their belts, the UK's Rolls-Royce saw sales rise about 150% - and it is all thanks to the Ghost, which now accounts for about three out of four cars the company sells. Even in the US, sales were up 220% during the year - yet, the carmaker's chief executive, Torsten Muller-Otvos, describes the North American market as weak. ""The US is still fragile,"" he laments in an interview with BBC News. ""It is not that people don't have money; not at all. It is a question of whether consumer sentiment is right, whether confidence is right, whether it feels right to go for a super luxury brand."" With such sales surges in a fragile market, it is clear that Rolls-Royce is still gunning for growth - well beyond current levels of about 2,500 cars per year. Mr Muller-Otvos is convinced this can be done without diluting the brand's exclusive feel. ""The number of cars is so low, it is a drop in a big sea of cars,"" he says. ""So even if volume doubled, the cars would still be rare."" To help fuel the fire, Rolls-Royce is planning to further expand its model range, with a convertible Ghost expected in about three years' time. Mr Muller-Otvos declines to comment on such speculation, though he confirms that ""there'll be a Ghost derivative to come, as that model's been quite popular"". Asian growth In the future, much of the sales growth will come in Asia, following strong growth in 2010. ""Asia has recovered particularly well,"" Mr Muller-Otvos says. ""We see nice growth in China, India and Australia."" In China, sales surged 800% last year - beating all expectations. The UK is also strong, having risen about 130% last year, while in the Middle East sales rose 160%. ""Our partners are very confident there, investing in new showrooms in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,"" Mr Muller-Otvos says. Wealthy women To the casual observer, models from carmakers such as Rolls-Royce do not change much over time, though Mr Muller-Otvos insists his customers are acutely aware of where the economic winds are blowing. So, in response to the prevailing downbeat economic mood, he has seen a ""shift from bling to substance"". ""Customers don't over-do the wood, the leather or the chrome and they chose more subtle colours inside,"" he says. ""There's a degree of sobriety."" Rolls-Royce is also appealing to the growing army of wealthy women. ""They love the Ghost,"" Mr Muller-Otvos says. ""Some 8-10% of our Ghost customers are female in the US, and it is also popular with women in the Middle East and in China."" That is a dramatic change from the recent past when almost all Rolls-Royce customers were men. ""With the Phantom, sales to women are very low,"" Mr Muller-Otvos says. ""We find that 99.9% of the time it is a male decision."" Some of Rolls-Royce's female customers ""bespoke the car in a feminine fashion"", he observes, but most of them stick to more traditional designs. ""Do you know what they like about the car?"" Mr Muller-Otvos asks. ""It's a male brand. It's a masculine car. It's a powerful car."" Diesel and hybrids? Mr Muller-Otvos is also keeping an eye on the carbon dioxide emissions debate, though for the time being his customers are not demanding better fuel economy. ""But that can change quite quickly,"" he acknowledges, pointing to how both attitudes and regulation change all the time. So to be prepared, Rolls-Royce is considering alternative engine solutions. As a subsidiary of the German carmaker BMW, which these days makes arguably the most efficient diesel engines in the world, Rolls-Royce would be well placed to introduce diesel engines in its cars - though so far its customers have said no to this. ""Our main markets are the US and Asia, neither of them diesel markets,"" explains Mr Muller-Otvos, while at the same time insisting that diesel engines could easily deliver the right torque for a Rolls-Royce. Petrol electric hybrid solutions could also work, he reasons. ""We will start to think about that, but first I'll need to find out whether this is acceptable for our customers."" Hence, do not expect Rolls-Royce to be at the cutting edge of innovation in this area. ""If you look at the most successful cars in that segment, they are not unusual, quirky cars,"" says Mr Muller-Otvos. ""Luxury cars need to have good substance. They must be well engineered. Our customers are buying authenticity at its best.""","Ultra-luxurious brands such as Rolls-Royce will always face one particular challenge: how to promote its cars' ""waftability"" during a downturn without making its owners look lofty and aloof."
"The wrestler-turned-actor could charge advertisers more than $1m (£790,000) per post last year, according to the social media marketing firm Hopper HQ. The Fast and Furious star knocked make-up entrepreneur Kylie Jenner off the top spot. She has 182 million Instagram followers, while he has 187 million. UK-based company Hopper HQ, which runs social media accounts on behalf of companies and individuals, published its first Instagram rich list in 2017. The rankings and cost per post were arrived at after speaking with so-called social media ""influencers"" themselves, along with brands and marketing companies, and using publicly available pricing information to estimate how much each account could charge. However, marketers tend to be secretive about how much they pay, or the posts may be part of a wider deal - as is often the case with A-list celebrities or sports stars - so the exact amounts are not known. Other high value personalities on its list for 2019 included footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, who was worth $889,000 per post, and socialite Kim Kardashian West, who could charge $858,000. Earlier this year, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was crowned by Forbes as the highest-paid actor in the world, having earned nearly $90m last year before tax. Outside of his film work, the action star has a major commercial partnership with Under Armour, the US sports brand he signed with in 2016. He has also been sponsored by tech giant Apple and the Norwegian bottled water brand Voss, in which he holds a stake. However, his current list of endorsement deals on Instagram appears surprisingly short. Scrolling through his feed, aside from selfies of the muscle-bound actor working out, most of The Rock's recent posts promote his own Tequila brand, Teremana. Other than that, his promotional posts are largely for new episodes of The Titans, an NBC TV series which he hosts, or films in which he stars, such as upcoming DC Comics feature Black Adam. The 10 celebrities who can charge the most per Instagram post 1. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, 187m followers - just over $1m per post 2. Kylie Jenner, 182m - $986,000 per post 3.

"The fine is the largest in China's corporate history and will require the firm to lower royalty rates on patents used in China's mobile phone market. The move could help Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and Huawei. Qualcomm said on Monday it would not contest the ruling that it violated China's anti-monopoly law. ""Although Qualcomm is disappointed with the results of the investigation, it is pleased that the NDRC (National Development and Reform Commission) has reviewed and approved the company's rectification plan,"" the tech giant said in a statement on Monday. Stake in China The firm, which is the biggest supplier of chips used in smartphones, will now charge royalties based on 65% of the selling price of phones in China, instead of on the entire price. China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand in the world's largest smartphone market, where Qualcomm as a key player. The chip giant made about half its global revenue of $26.5bn in China in its last fiscal year. News of the agreement sent the company's New York listed shares up 2.8% in after-hours trading. The firm also increased its profit and revenue forecast for the current fiscal year. Chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said he was pleased the resolution had removed ""uncertainty"" surroundings its business in China. ""We will now focus our full attention and resources on supporting our customers and partners in China and pursuing the many opportunities ahead,"" he said.",US chipmaker Qualcomm will pay $975m (£640m) to Chinese authorities to end a 14 month anti-trust investigation into its patent licensing practices.
"His administration is pushing for a simpler tax code and lower rates, but it has said it will leave the details of the proposal to Congress. Lawmakers are expected to present a bill in coming months. ""They have to do it,"" he said in a speech on Wednesday. ""It is time."" There is broad agreement that the US tax code - which runs to thousands of pages - needs to be simplified. Powerful business organisations in the US, including the Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable, are supporting the effort. 'Pitfalls' Republicans hope to achieve tax reform by the end of the year. But reaching agreement on the details will be tough, analysts say. The last time the US tax code was overhauled was in 1986. ""There are a lot of potential pitfalls,"" said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the Tax Foundation. ""Although there's a lot of political will behind this effort, it's not hard to imagine a world in which it doesn't work out."" Mr Trump said the US has surrendered its competitive advantage by having one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world. He wants to lower the federal rate from 35% to 15%, as well as change how firms would be taxed on business overseas. The lower rates would be funded in part by eliminating dozens of special loopholes, designed for specific industries and scenarios. Mr Trump has said the changes will jumpstart economic growth and make the system more fair for regular families. But his speech did not go into specifics, sticking close to general principles he outlined earlier this year. Cross-party support? Democrats have said they will not support a tax plan that offers relief for the very wealthy. They also say they want the plan to be deficit neutral, which would force lawmakers to identify how they might make up for any lost tax revenue. Mr Trump said he hoped Congress would not disappoint on this campaign, appealing to Democrats and Republicans to work together. The president's other major legislative effort - to repeal the Affordable Care Act - faltered earlier this summer, after Republicans and Democrats could not agree. ""I think Congress is going to make a comeback,"" he said. ""I hope so. I tell you what - the United States is counting on it.""","US President Donald Trump said ""it's time"" for US lawmakers to act on tax reform, increasing pressure on Congress as he seeks to make good on one of his biggest campaign promises."
"The warning came as the group posted a pre-tax profit of 22.4m euros (£17.7m) in the first six months of the year, up nearly 30% from a year earlier. The company said revenues were up 20% to 550m euros. Fyffes said it offset the higher costs by increasing volumes and overhauling its shipping costs. ""The industry experienced a number of headwinds during the first half of the year, including a significant adverse movement in exchange rates, due to the relative strength of the US dollar, combined with higher fruit,"" Fyffes said. It added that the price of fuel used in its ships rose 20%. Fyffes is ""continuing to pursue necessary increases in selling prices in its key markets in the context of these higher costs and less favourable exchange rates,"" it added. Global food prices have jumped in recent months due to volatile and extreme weather conditions, particularly due to a drought in the US and a heat wave in some parts of Eastern Europe.",Tropical fruit supplier Fyffes has warned of higher banana and pineapple prices due to rising fuel costs and adverse exchange rates.
"By Padraig BeltonTechnology of Business reporter He's talking about how hard it can be for black tech entrepreneurs to raise money. But Mr Smith saw it as a challenge. ""It doesn't matter what box they put me in to begin with, I'll get out of that box and prove to them I'm bigger and better. I think this fuels me,"" he says. His firm is a US platform for jobs in the gig economy, offering work to those who want flexible hours. 'Supportive' According to a study of 9,874 US business founders by California-based social enterprise RateMyInvestor, only 1% of start-ups receiving venture capital were black. But Mr Smith was fortunate to have New York-based Harlem Capital Partners, which focuses its investments on minority and women founders. More Technology of Business ""They've been extremely supportive, as an investor and also a friend and a partner,"" he says Black Lives Matter not only shone a spotlight on policing, but also on other fields, like the technology industry. In the US, 13% of the workforce is black, but at Google that proportion is just 3.7% and at Facebook 3.8%. To understand why this is, follow the money, says Sydney Sykes, a Harvard graduate and venture capital investor who in 2018 co-founded BLCK VC. Venture capital - that is, early investments in a company of between $1m (£750,000) and $30m in return for shares - is how most new start-ups get out of the blocks. But 81% of venture capital (VC) funds specialising in making these types of investment lack a black partner. Partly as a result, 75% of fundraising rounds go to all-white founding teams, says Marlon Nichols, a founding managing partner at California's MaC Venture Capital. 'Exciting investments' Sydney Sykes says investors in tech start-ups ""go by their gut feeling, and that's where bias creeps in"". She says investors financially back someone if they are ""connected with this person"", or perhaps an entrepreneur reminds them of Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. But she believes ""when you close your mind to different types of entrepreneurs, you're missing out on exciting investments and great companies"". And Marlon Nichols asserts that ethnically diverse founding teams deliver investors better returns - on average 3.3 times their invested capital, compared with 2 times for all-white founders. Ms Sykes started a network of black investors. She and another VC principal, Frederik Groce, held a dinner and invited all the black people they knew in VC in the San Francisco Bay area, as well as other friends. ""We ended up being about 30 people, and most of the black investors in California, which is pretty wild,"" she says. Dinner went on ""very much longer than it was supposed to"" and by the end they'd started a network to encourage and mentor black people wanting to enter venture capital. Duplicating excesses? Black business founder Donnel Baird says raising funding has been ""far and away the hardest part"". Mr Baird's start-up, Brooklyn-based BlocPower, hires local unemployed workers to replace apartment blocks' antiquated climate systems with modern heat pumps. These are 20-50% more efficient than air conditioners and two to three times more efficient than boiler-based furnace systems, he says. The biggest challenge is documenting each building well enough to attract crowdsourced finance, so systems won't cost residents anything up front, and can be paid for out of future savings. They've developed a modelling tool called BlocMaps that quickly integrates city data sources with on-site observations, while drawing on the 1,000 buildings they've worked on so far in New York. He says as founders like him make profitable exits, and have access to capital to invest in new start-ups, Silicon Valley will change. ""I don't think it's going to be a very long time from now,"" says Mr Baird. ""I think it's going to be five years."" But he asks of his generation of black founders: ""Are we going to try to help Silicon Valley build the better world it says it wants to build, or are we going to duplicate the same excesses just with a black person in charge?"" Growth circles Turning to the UK, lack of funding has also been an issue, one which the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has helped highlight. In the wake of BLM, many British people, both black and white, want to support black-owned small businesses, says Benedicta Banga, who was born in Zimbabwe and lives in Solihull in the West Midlands. So she started Blaqbase, a marketplace platform, largely because she wasn't finding things she needed locally ""like makeup for my skin type, and black-owned brands weren't very visible online"". Black-owned businesses are the least-funded businesses, she says, and this is problem is compounded if you aren't visible. ""Then you don't grow, and you don't get funded because you're not growing,"" she says. While she initially thought of the platform as just being UK-based, most of the businesses on it ship worldwide, and her platform has gained users in the US, Asia and the Caribbean, she says. 'Beacon of hope' Another British-based tech entrepreneur, Ikenna Ordor, has started a sharing economy platform for higher-end vehicles - Starr Luxury Cars - which has expanded into private jets. A few of his car clients turned out to be private jet owners, who were keen to earn money from renting their aircraft out. When coronavirus struck, these services were suddenly in demand. City workers who would always take the train into London, started to rent cars twice a week to drive to the office, says Mr Ordor. As a Nigerian-born male, he says there is a stigma associating Nigerians with fraud. He also says black-owned businesses are less likely to be offered bank loans than other companies. So he ultimately hopes that his example can be a ""beacon of hope for young men thinking about starting businesses"".","""I think a lot of folks like myself never even get a chance, because folks don't answer their phones, or listen to their idea, but put them in a box they shouldn't be in,"" says Zack Smith, the founder of Boston-based Jobble."
"Erudio Student Loans won the bid to buy the remaining 17% of mortgage-style loans taken out by students between 1990 and 1998. Student leaders secured assurances from ministers the terms and conditions of the loans would not change. Loans taken out by students paying higher fees of up to £9,000 a year are not covered by the sale. Public debt National Union of Students president Toni Pearce said the move was ""extremely concerning"" as it would see ""the public subsidising a private company making a profit from public debt"". ""The impact of this sale won't only affect borrowers, but will affect everybody. ""The simple fact is that having these loans on the public books would be better off for the government in the long run. ""Selling off the loan book at a discount to secure a cash lump sum now doesn't make economic sense."" These loans, superseded in 1997, ""are a closed portfolio of ageing debts that are becoming harder to collect with time"", the Student Loans Company said in its 2013-14 business plan. Universities Minister David Willetts said: ""The sale of the remaining mortgage-style student loan book represents good value for money, helping to reduce public sector net debt by £160m. ""The private sector is well placed to maximise returns from the book which has a deteriorating value. ""The sale will allow the Student Loans Company to focus on supplying loans to current students and collecting repayments on newer loans. ""Borrowers will remain protected and there will be no change to their terms and conditions, including the calculation of interest rates for loans."" Good deal? Erudio is backed by a consortium including consumer debt management companies CarVal Investors and Arrow Global. Arrow Global, which will be the ""master servicer"" for the entire portfolio, is described as one of Europe's largest providers of debt solutions. It has invested £11m in acquiring the student loans and has a commitment to invest up to £22m extra in assets by January 2016. CarVal Investors is one of the largest purchasers of consumer loans in the UK market. Chair of the university think-tank million+ Professor Michael Gunn said: ""The big question is how much the Treasury will receive and whether this is a good deal for the taxpayer. ""Given the problems that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is facing in balancing its budget there is a clear case for the proceeds of the sale to be reinvested in higher education to avoid further damaging cuts to the funding of teaching and student support."" Vulnerable borrowers With mortgage-style loans, borrowers repay in fixed monthly instalments over a set period of five or seven years. Interest on the loan is charged at the rate of inflation, as measured by the Retail Prices Index. Repayments can be deferred if the borrower's income falls below 85% of national average earnings - currently £28,775. Two previous sales of mortgage-style loans in 1998 and 1999 saw £2bn of loans transferred to the private sector. About one million borrowers remained with the Student Loans Company following those sales, and 69% of those have now fully repaid their debts. The government has received £2.9bn in repayments. Of the latest tranche of 250,000 loans sold: The government said Erudio would have to adhere to Office of Fair Trading guidelines on the treatment of vulnerable borrowers and those in financial difficulty.",The government has sold £890m of student loans to a debt management consortium for £160m.
"The economy has now grown for six months in a row, but the economy still remains well below the size it was before the pandemic began. The Office for National Statistics said that while GDP in October was 23.4% higher than the low point seen in April, it remained 7.9% below the levels seen in February, before the first lockdown took place. But what exactly is GDP, and how is it measured in the UK? What is GDP? Gross domestic product (GDP) is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. But the measurement most people focus on is the percentage change - the growth of the country's economy over a period of time, typically a quarter (three months) or a year. It's been used since the 1940s. The most important percentage change is given in real terms - it strips out the effect of rising prices or inflation. If the GDP measure is up on the previous three months, the economy is growing. That generally means more wealth and more new jobs. If it is negative, the economy is shrinking. And two consecutive three-month periods of shrinking meets the most widely accepted definition of a recession. How is it measured? GDP can be measured in three ways: In the UK, the ONS publishes one single measure of GDP, which is calculated using all three ways of measuring. But early estimates - mainly use the output measure. It collects data from thousands of UK companies to use in its calculations. What is it used for? It's the main way of determining the health of the UK economy. The Bank of England uses it as one of the key indicators in setting how much it will charge banks to lend them money, which is the rate it uses to try to control the economy. So, for example, if prices are rising too fast, the bank could increase that rate to try to slow the economy down. But it might hold off if GDP growth is slow. The Treasury uses GDP when planning economic policy. When an economy is shrinking, the amount the government gets from taxes tends to fall and the government adjusts its tax and spending plans accordingly. UK GDP is also used internationally by financial bodies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to compare growth between different countries. Why is it often changed later? The UK produces one of the earliest estimates of GDP of the major economies, about 40 days after the quarter in question. This provides the government with an early estimate of the real growth in economic activity. It is quick but mainly based on the output measure. At that stage, only about 60% of the data is available, so this figure is revised as more information comes in. Revisions can be made later as more information becomes available or when definitions change. The ONS publishes more information on how this is done on its website. What are its limitations? GDP growth doesn't tell the whole story. There are lots of things the statistics might not take into account: Plus, GDP is only one way to think about a country's development. Just because GDP is increasing, it doesn't mean that a citizen's standard of living is improving. For example, in times of war, GDP will often increase because more money is being spent. Different countries have developed alternative measures to determine a country's health. In 2010, the ONS started measuring wellbeing alongside economic growth. It looks at health, relationships, education and skills, as well as personal finances and the environment. In 2019, New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Arden, released the country's first ""wellbeing budget"", prioritising health and life satisfaction rather than economic growth.","The UK's economy grew by just 0.4% in October, latest figures show, as the recovery from the first coronavirus lockdown slowed."
"The proposed deal would combine the second and third largest cable operators in the US. Charter is also buying Bright House Networks, another cable operator, for $10.4bn. The combined three firms will serve cable television and broadband to 23.9 million customers in 41 states. Charter will pay about $55bn in cash and stock for Time Warner Cable, with the balance of the $78.7bn valuation coming from TWC's debts. US cable companies are facing stiff competition from online service providers such as Amazon and Netflix, as customers increasingly choose to stream films and television shows over the internet at a time of their convenience. Cable companies are responding by trying to cut costs and improve the quality of their shows. The new merged cable giant will compete with US cable market leader Comcast, which currently has about 27 million customers. Charter's takeover move comes a month after Comcast abandoned its plan to buy Time Warner Cable fearing pressure from regulators. 'Public interest' The latest deal is also likely to come under regulatory scrutiny, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) quickly issued a statement. ""The FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest,"" FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said. ""In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient. The commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved."" The merged company would still be smaller than Comcast, which serves about a third of US broadband customers, said analyst Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson Research. ""One has to be sober about genuine risks that this deal could still be rejected,"" he added.

"By Stav DimitropoulosTechnology of Business reporter For 31 years he has been fishing in the South Euboean Gulf, mainly at night, heading to Nea Makri's port at noon to sell his catch, either to local restaurants or his many loyal clients. ""I use small nets,"" Mr Athinaios says. ""Occasionally, I lose some of them, but nothing special - about 10m (32ft) per year, which costs me about €20,"" he says. But imagine those lost nets scaled-up to the size of the giant nets used by ocean going trawlers. ""These big boats use nets over 45m in height and 800m in length, which may cost €5,000-€6,000 or much more,"" says Mr Athinaios. More Technology of Business When those nets get lost at sea, they become ghost nets, an expense for fishermen and deadly for marine life. It's hard to measure the scale of the problem, but in 2009 the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation estimated that 640,000 tonnes of fishing gear was lost or discarded in the seas over year. In 2015 a single mission by WWF in the Baltic recovered 268 tonnes of nets, ropes and other material. And because nets are made of nylon, or other tough synthetic compounds, they can survive in the oceans for decades, catching, injuring and killing all sorts of marine life. The ghost nets also damage coral, breaking their brittle skeletons, destroying their soft tissue, and killing large chunks of the reef. To help tackle the problem British, Portuguese, and Spanish organisations and universities, and figures from the European fishing industry, are co-operating on a project called NetTag. It aims to promote new technologies that cut down on the number of lost nets, and to educate fishermen about new practices to limit losses. Its key technology is a special underwater acoustic transponder - the NetTag - that fishermen can attach to their nets and other gear. NetTag's transponders work using sound waves, which travel efficiently over long distances under water. When the surface vessel sends out a signal the transponder replies and by calculating the time difference between the signal and response the net can be located. ""For an estimated cost of about €300 each, NetTag can help fishermen safeguard assets costing thousands of euros,"" says Jeff Neasham, an electrical engineer at Newcastle University and lead researcher of the project. Dr Neasham helped design the transponders, which are about the size of a matchbox. They have similar batteries to smartphones, but use circuitry which requires very low power, which means they can operate for many months attached to a net. ""These transponders definitely work. The technology is practical,"" says Brian von Herzen, an environmentalist and executive director of the Climate Foundation, a non-profit organisation tackling food security. However, he is not certain that the NetTag will be attractive to the operators of big fishing boats, who might not want to waste time retrieving lost nets. Mr von Herzen says that even if the new transponder allows fish boats to locate lost nets, they still might spend half a day recovering the equipment. That time could be more valuable than the price of the net. Mr Athinaios finds NetTag environmentally very promising, but is also sceptical whether it will modify his fellow professionals' behaviour. Since 2009 a European Community Council Regulation has required fishing boats to recover any lost fishing gear as soon as possible - carrying equipment on board for this purpose - or else potentially face harsh fines, and ultimately confiscation of the vessel or fishing gear. ""Yet, nothing has changed,"" says Mr Athinaios. ""The law is not enforced. Most of us have equipment like GPS and plotters. Big boats have advanced equipment and crews of divers to track lost gear down, but they don't do it because they can make €6,000, the cost say, of a lost net on any given day."" Dr Neasham says that if fishermen have the precise coordinates to retrieve a net via GPS, then they are not really searching for a ghost net. ""We are talking about situations where gear has been moved by storms, broken away from moorings, or caught by other vessels and cut loose,"" Dr Neasham says. ""The skipper of our research boat has been involved in many attempts to retrieve lost gear and, even when they are confident they know where a ghost net is, the net can prove to be several hundred metres off where they finally manage to hook it."" He is convinced that NetTag will save lots of time and money. Mr von Herzen thinks the solution is to reward fishermen for retrieving ghost nets. In regions like Europe where the fisherman's catch is capped, he suggests that for each net recovered that cap could be raised. ""In this case, these low-cost transponders would come in handy,"" Mr von Herzen says. ""We should propose these revised regulations, and have a period of public comment, in which we would have town meetings and discussions - instead of lectures - with the fishermen,"" he adds. He thinks it could also change the culture of fishing. ""They would view themselves as stewards of the ocean,"" suggests Mr von Herzen. Over the next months, the NetTag project will conduct full field trials with fishermen in Portugal and Spain, who will be the first to try out the technology before it hits the markets. Dr Neasham is confident the endeavour will do away with the ""epidemic"" of ghost nets. ""We should be expecting 90% of lost fishing gear to be recovered in the developed world over the next 10 years if the project becomes mainstream.""","Jannis Athinaios is preparing to sell his merchandise, an assortment of fresh red mullets, red snappers, white sea bream and blunt-snouted mullets, at the sun-washed port of Nea Makri, a coastal town 25km northeast of Athens."
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter On a recent trip to Beijing, or so goes the tale, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister told the Chinese President how much he wanted a large, wide road running through the centre of Port Moresby, the capital. No problem, remarked the Chinese President. Just tell me one thing, he asked. Should it be wide enough for tanks to roll down, like ours? There are lots of these sorts of anecdotes about Chinese investment going round Port Moresby these days, and this dark joke points to some of the anxieties here as Beijing's influence grows. Rising investment Driving around Port Moresby ahead of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, my local guide points out all the projects the Chinese have helped to build for the event. Roads, venues - even the bus stops have been built with Chinese money. The impoverished nation is hosting the meeting that brings together world and business leaders, with trade talks high on the agenda. China's President Xi Jinping arrived on Thursday for a state visit ahead of the summit. But China's interest here isn't new. In the last decade the scale of Chinese aid and investment across the Pacific has increased substantially, as the Lowy Institute's recent studies show. According to the institute's Pacific Aid Map, China's aid spend in Papua New Guinea (PNG) totalled $20.83m (£15.99m) in 2016. A year later it was three times that amount. Let's put this in context. Australia still spends far more in Papua New Guinea than China does - 70% of the country's aid comes from its former colonial ruler. Papua New Guinea is the poorest member of Apec and around 40% of the population live on less than $1 a day, according to the UN. Locals tell me that Australia has historically invested in areas like education and providing training for better governance. China meanwhile is investing in areas that Papua New Guinea says it desperately needs right now: infrastructure. ""China has built us roads, bridges, and they'll continue doing that,"" executive director of the Papua New Guinea Business Council Douveri Henao tells me. ""And it's not just in PNG. The ambition is right across the Pacific."" It's all part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, a multi-billion dollar programme aimed at connecting China to the rest of the world through trade and investment. It's President Xi Jinping's baby - but that same Chinese ambition is what's thought to be behind Australia's commitment of a $1bn Pacific fund last week to invest in infrastructure and counter China's growing influence here. Also, critics of China's aid and investment policy in Papua New Guinea tell me that often the problem with Chinese money here is that there's no transparency in how the funds are disbursed and who they go to. Part of the problem is the lack of governance and high levels of corruption within Papua New Guinea itself. But the other issue is that Beijing often spends the cash first - and asks questions later. This often leads to unnecessary and wasteful projects, when the money could have been used for other more pressing needs in the country like healthcare. Aid becomes political There are economic and diplomatic reasons why Beijing is investing in the Pacific. Papua New Guinea for instance is home to many natural resources including rare earth minerals, and the Pacific Island nations are home to a third of the world's supporters of Taiwan - something analysts say China would like to influence. But it's China's longer term strategic ambitions that are raising the biggest questions. ""What you're seeing now is the geopoliticisation of aid,"" Jonathan Pryke, of the Lowy Institute told me. ""The big fear of countries like Australia and the US is that Beijing's end game is to set up a permanent military base somewhere in the Pacific in the next twenty to thirty years. That's why you've seen Washington and Canberra react the way that they have to increasing Chinese influence in the Pacific."" Papua New Guinea sits a few thousand kilometres from Guam, a US base. A recent report from the US Department of Defense on China's military power highlights how it is entirely plausible that the Chinese army will want to ""extend its operations beyond the first island chain, demonstrating the capability to strike US and allied forces and military bases in the western Pacific Ocean, including Guam."" Most analysts, including the Lowy Institute's Mr Pryke, don't actually believe this will happen. But it's enough of a threat to convince the Americans and the Australians to pay far more attention to the Pacific. That is why it won't just be China splashing the cash at Papua New Guinea this week. The US, Australia and Japan are all likely to come bearing gifts for the Pacific island nation when they visit Port Moresby for Apec. Papua New Guinea is now the latest battleground in the tussle for economic and political influence between China and the West.",There's a bar joke going around Port Moresby these days about how the Chinese agreed to fund the construction of the city's main boulevard.
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter Thursday's £56m fine from the Financial Conduct Authority and the Bank of England over the spectacular 2012 computer blow-up is the latest in a series of punishments for failure and misconduct stretching back years. The bank has paid out billions of pounds in fines and compensation payments for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance, the manipulation of the inter-bank lending rate, the mis-selling of interest rate products to small businesses and the manipulation of the foreign exchange market. Looking ahead, there are still large hurdles to clamber over. RBS is facing fines over its involvement in American mortgage products which were at the heart of the US financial crisis. There are also likely to be more fines connected to forex problems for a number of banks, including RBS. The US Department of Justice is still to adjudicate on the matter, probably in the New Year. A banking chief executive from another bank told me that if we thought the billions of pounds in foreign exchange fines we saw last week were large, just wait until we see what the DoJ decides to do. ""It will put last week into the shade,"" I was told. Long tail of failure Beyond forex, RBS is also facing legal action over its attempts to raise £12bn of capital to save itself during the 2008 financial crisis. If all those issues are dealt with before the end of 2015, many within the bank will be surprised. The long tail of failure and misconduct is now one of the most serious facing the bank's reputation. Ross McEwan, the chief executive of RBS, has said that the culture is changing and that bad behaviour is simply unacceptable. But as the computer failure shows, saying something at the top of organisation does not necessarily translate into action at the front line. The FCA said that the IT problems revealed ""failures at many levels within the RBS Group to identify and manage risks"". Decades in underinvestment in ""dull"" technology led to the mess of 2012. Mr McEwan knows that banking is an essential service, dealing at its most basic in looking after people's money. It failed in that duty.",The Royal Bank of Scotland is in the process of looking for a new chairman. Whoever it is will need a strong stomach.
"The stock fell by more than 3% in extended US trading on Tuesday. The firm, which makes the popular Fifa football and Battlefield multi-shooter games, lowered its 2015 revenue forecast to $3.9bn (£2.4b) from $4bn. However, it reported a better-than-expected profit of $398m for the three months ending in December. This was partly due to a 27% increase in digital revenues from titles such as Madden NFL Ultimate Team and The Simpsons Tapped Out. The California-based company has been focused on increasing sales of its digital games, which earn higher margins compared to traditional packaged console games. EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said the company was having to cater to ""a new generation of games"". ""In addition to consoles, our mobile games, digital downloads and live services are growing year-over-year,"" he said in a statement. User transition Game makers such as EA, Sony and Nintendo have been grappling with what some herald as the end of the traditional video game. In recent years, sales of older, traditional machine consoles such as the Microsoft Xbox 360 and Sony PlayStation 3 have dropped as users switch to playing games on their smartphones and tablets. As a result, the gaming industry has been shifting more of their resources to web software as less shoppers buy console hardware. Analysts say another strategy includes releasing fewer but bigger next-generation game titles. EA for example, plans to release science-fiction shooter game Titanfall as an exclusive title for Microsoft's Xbox consoles and personal computers in March. Over the next two years, it is also expected to release games licensed from Walt Disney's Star Wars franchise. Rivals such as Sony, which makes the PlayStation 4, is also offering franchised material and exclusive games such as Infamous: Second Son and Transistor. Microsoft, which makes the Xbox, is developing exclusive content and applications such as the next instalment of Halo, a game linked to a forthcoming TV show.",US video game publisher Electronic Arts (EA) has cut its full-year sales outlook after reduced demand for older gaming console titles ate into profits.
"By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC News But although the Gunners are on the pitch this Saturday, the doors will remain firmly shut. The government has given pubs in England the go ahead to reopen from 4 July if they follow a strict set of social distancing rules, but last week the Tollington's manager, Martin Whelan, posted a message on social media announcing it would stay closed. ""We cannot in good conscience open the pub when contracting a deadly virus is still possible under these guidelines,"" he tweeted. The decision was met with a flood of support on Twitter with customers praising it as a ""wise"" and ""courageous"" decision. Only a handful were scornful, urging them to be less cautious and open up. None of the other eight bars Mr Whelan runs around London will be opening either. ""Some of my staff have had this virus and when you've seen them at death's door you take a different point of view,"" Mr Whelan says. ""It's a very sobering position to be in."" Once the virus is circulating at lower levels in the population and there's a ""proper track and trace scheme"" up and running then he would consider reopening, he says. In the meantime he couldn't look his staff in the eye and ask them to come back with confidence. ""Nobody likes losing money but you have to have a conscience too."" Britain's pubs were among the hardest hit businesses when lockdown came. Many had to pour away beer that grew stale, throw away food that couldn't be served, board up premises and furlough staff. Now social distancing rules have been reduced from two metres to ""one plus"" and the government has set out conditions, including taking the names and contact details of customers, to mitigate some of the risks. The big pub chains including JD Wetherspoon and Stonegate Ei are opening almost all of their sites with modifications including plastic screens, one way systems, reduced seating, and apps for ordering food and drink. 'Unique venue' Nevertheless only around half of the UK's pubs will be open this weekend, according to a survey by the industry body UK Hospitality. Pubs in Scotland and Wales haven't yet been allowed to reopen, accounting for a lot of those remaining shut, but still a large number of pubs in England won't be welcoming back customers either. For some it simply isn't economically viable to do so. Chris and Liz Smith run The Chambers which used to host live music and serve food in a packed basement in Folkestone. ""We're quite a unique venue. We offer a bit of everything, but music is the key for us functioning,"" says Ms Smith. Without music they don't think the atmosphere would work, but there are also the insurmountable problems of a single narrow staircase down to the basement and a narrow corridor to the toilet. ""We don't want to open if we can't do it properly,"" says Mr Smith, but he recognises there is a possibility they may never be able to reopen at all. Other pubs can accommodate guests more easily, like the Prospect in Exeter, which, even with reduced seating can manage space for 78 outdoors in the fresh air. But landlord Suzanne Abrey-Cameron is apprehensive about what the prime minister has dubbed ""Super Saturday"" after all these weeks of people being cooped up indoors. ""There's a lot of expectation,"" she says. ""It'll be worse than Black Friday."" So the Prospect won't open until 9 July when she hopes things will have calmed down. ""We've missed out on four months, one weekend is not going to make a difference."" Moreover, the opening hours will be ""weather permitting"" since they are only serving customers al fresco. One of the large chains, Greene King, is also only opening its pubs after the weekend, not because of concerns over unruly behaviour, but to ensure staff and facilities are ready. ""It wasn't a case of avoiding the hysteria, more making sure the teams were ready,"" says Karl Gibson, who manages Greene King's Trip to Jerusalem pub in Nottingham. He's taken down the boards protecting the pub during lockdown, which they'd decorated with messages of support for the NHS, and is preparing for a gradual return, spread out over ten days from Monday. But for some city centre pubs, especially in Nottingham, which is in striking distance of Leicester where pubs remain closed due to the local lockdown, there is a shadow of concern over this weekend's openings. The police have warned that pub-goers shouldn't treat it as an excuse for excess. Tony Cockcroft of the British Security Industry Association says security firms have seen a wave of enquiries ahead of the weekend. ""We're looking at levels akin to a bank holiday weekend,"" he says. Extra security staff are likely to be needed if queues form outside pubs and possibly to administer and explain the new regulations to customers as they enter. But Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, points out that this is all very familiar territory for a lot of city centre landlords, accustomed to managing anti-social behaviour at busy weekends. Moreover for the time being volumes are likely to remain much lower than usual. ""In recent weeks we've seen what happens when you don't have facilities open, there is that pent-up demand,"" she says. ""You have illegal raves in Manchester, you have crowding at beauty hotspots. ""Reopening the pubs, bars and restaurants could be part of the solution not part of the problem. We can provide for people who want to get out of the house and make sure there's social distancing policed on premises.""","Back in normal times, on match days, the pavement outside the Tollington Arms would be as crowded as a Tube station. The pub is right next to the Emirates stadium, Arsenal's home ground, and is a popular sports pub."

"British banks are generally not accepting the notes and technically, they should not leave the country. One of the clearest options for overseas Indians is to travel back to India to exchange the notes in person. They stopped being legal tender at midnight on Tuesday as part of a government crackdown on corruption. Indians will be able to exchange their old notes for new ones at the country's banks until 30 December. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said Indians could deposit them in their non-resident ordinary rupee accounts, a type of bank account where people living abroad park income earned in India. However, this has been complicated by many banks abroad not accepting the notes. Foreign tourists have been advised by the Indian central bank they have until midnight on Friday to exchange the discontinued currency at airports. Ankeet, a 40 year-old currency trader from London, told the BBC he had given 2,000 rupees of his old notes to a cousin flying to India. ""Normally the Bank of India should provide an option, but nothing has come out,"" he told the BBC's Asian Network. ""I'm very lucky that I have a relative who's flying tomorrow, so my only option would be essentially to give it to him and ask him to enjoy it,"" he said. ""I've got a friend in the US who has close to 50,000 rupees, which is about $1,000. He will probably write it off,"" he added. 'Not accepted' The 22 billion banned currency notes represent 85% of the cash in circulation in India, which is an overwhelmingly cash-based economy. Indian banks ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India and Baroda Bank have said they do not handle physical rupees in the UK. Tourists with leftover notes can exchange up to 5,000 rupees' worth at airport exchange counters by the Friday deadline, according to the RBI guidance. M&S Bank is advising customers: ""Indian rupees cannot be taken in or out of India, therefore we wouldn't be able to accept them."" Travelex, a foreign exchange company, said on Wednesday that customers with a buyback guarantee from when they purchased the rupees would be able to swap them back. How long have people got to change their old notes? The 500 ($7; £6) and 1,000 ($15; £12) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations and hospitals will only accept them until 11 November. People will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December. How much 'black money' is there in circulation? The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of ""black money"" is a huge problem in India. The idea here is to lock out money that is unaccounted for and make it visible for tax purposes - banks will be happy to exchange a few thousand rupees, but will be asking questions of those who turn up with hundreds of thousands or millions in currency. Is there a limit on the amount an individual or household can cash in? It seems not. An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash. Government guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.","People outside of India holding discontinued 500 and 1,000-rupee (£6; £12) notes face difficulties exchanging them, BBC research has found."
"But the media company said 205,000 new customers joined Sky in the UK and Ireland in the second quarter, its highest rise there for 10 years. It was also announced that James Murdoch would become the chairman of Sky. He had previously been chairman of what was then BSkyB. Operating profits were their highest for a first half at £747m, up 12%. But operating expenses were a hefty £223m - primarily the result of paying for financial adviser and ""transaction fees"" incurred as part of its buyout of the remaining minority shareholdings in Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, which left pre-tax profits lower. BSkyB merged with its two sister broadcasters, Sky Italia and Sky Deutschland in 2014 in a £7bn deal. It was renamed Sky. In Germany and Austria, Sky gained 120,000 new customers in the second quarter of the latest financial year, which it said made Germany one of European's fastest-growing pay TV markets. In Italy it attracted 12,000 new customers over the same three months. 'Excellent' performance Revenue in Germany and Austria rose by 10% to £693m, driven by the new customers. However, it made an operating loss of £34m for various reasons, including an increase in Bundesliga football costs and a rise in Champions League costs under the new 2015-16 deal. In Italy, revenue fell by 3% to £953m because of a fall in customers over the past year and the fact that in the previous year the broadcaster had benefited from advertising around the World Cup. Operating profit fell by £6m to £25m. Charlie Huggins, Investment Analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown described the company's first half performance as ""excellent"". He highlighted the fact that customers in the UK and Ireland stay with the group for an average of 10 years giving it a secure revenue base. ""Sky has built a very strong brand in the UK. It is the clear market leader in pay TV but it faces the challenge of margin pressure, as competitors like BT bid against it for key content rights,"" he said. ""If it can raise the performance of Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia, the impact of rising sports content costs might not be felt so badly. A larger Sky could potentially be better placed to bid for new rights too"". ""It now has around three years to try and improve the acquired businesses, before it has to go into battle for another set of Premiership rights"".",Sky has reported a £12m fall in pre-tax profits to £524m for the six months to the end of December.
"Home Retail Group shares closed down 14% after it said like-for-like sales - which strip out new selling space - at Argos fell 9.6% in 13 weeks to 28 May. It added there had been a ""significant decline"" in sales of consumer electronics goods at Argos. However, trading at its Homebase DIY chain was helped by the warm weather. ""Trading conditions, particularly at Argos, have proved to be more difficult and volatile than anticipated,"" said Terry Duddy, Home Retail Group's chief executive, in the firm's trading update. ""Despite this the group has gained or held market share in its businesses."" Like-for-like sales at Homebase rose 1.6% over the three month period, which Home Retail Group described as a ""good outcome"" and was helped by strong sales of garden goods. At Argos, the main factor behind the recent sales slump was the fall in the consumer electronics market, the company said. ""The difficulty of this market, together with the volatility of overall sales, has made the balance of the year more difficult to predict,"" Mr Duddy said. ""While we remain cautious for the balance of the financial year, we are focused on our operational performance while continuing to invest across the businesses,"" he added. In April, Home Retail Group reported a 10% fall in profits for the year to 26 February. Consumer pressure Sports fashion retailer JD Sports also released a trading update on Thursday, in which it said underlying sales had dipped slightly. Like-for-like sales over the first 18 weeks of its financial year were down 2.8%, having dropped 1.2% in the first eight weeks. However, the retailer said that comparisons had been made more complicated because last year's trading was helped by the run-up to the 2010 World Cup. Nevertheless, it said its outlook remained cautious because of the ""very clear downward pressures on levels of gross consumer expenditure in our market and the increased VAT take from such expenditure"". Car parts retailer Halfords also said it expected the consumer environment to ""remain challenging"", as it reported a 7.7% rise in full year profits to £118.1m. The firm said like-for-like sales in the nine weeks to 3 June were up 0.8%, helped by a strong rise in sales of leisure goods such as bicycles. On Tuesday, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said retail sales in May had fallen by 2.1% compared with a year earlier. The previous two months has seen sales increase, but the BRC said the May figures were a more realistic reflection of the ""tough conditions"" on the High Street as March and April had been ""distorted"" by a late Easter, an extra bank holiday and good weather.

"McDonald's said its Veggie Dippers meal - including vegan nuggets served with chips and a soft drink - will launch in the UK on 2 January. It follows the likes of KFC and Greggs in introducing vegan options. Animal rights activists Peta said a vegan meal was ""the very definition of a happy meal"". However, it said it would continue to campaign for McDonald's to bring its McVegan burger, which is available in Finland and Sweden, to the UK. McDonald's new dippers are made of rice, red peppers, tomato pesto and split peas, fried in breadcrumbs. The product will be fried separately from products containing meat, a spokesman said, and served with McDonald's UK chips, which are vegan-friendly. The move comes as restaurants are capitalising on increasing demand from UK customers for vegetarian and vegan food options. McDonald's said in the last 12 months it had seen an ""80% uplift"" in customers ordering vegetarian options. The firm is the latest fast food chain to offer vegan products. Famously, Greggs launched a vegan sausage roll at the beginning of the year which it credited with boosting sales. Other chains with vegan options include Frankie & Benny's, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Nando's, Papa John's and Pizza Hut. 'Encouraging consumers' The Humane Society International UK, which campaigns for animal welfare, said McDonald's move would help veganism go mainstream. ""When big global brands like McDonalds start serving up vegan food, it can have a huge meat-reduction impact overall,"" director Claire Bass told the BBC. Peta director Elisa Allen said: ""A vegan meal - one that doesn't require killing - is the very definition of a happy meal. ""We'll continue to encourage consumers to vote with their wallets and choose vegan to help spare pigs, cows, and chickens a short, miserable life and a violent death.""

"By Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News He was arrested on Monday as part of an investigation into suspected fraud and false advertising, involving the sale of vehicles equipped with emissions cheating software. He has spent the past few days incarcerated behind the high concrete walls of Augsburg-Gablingen prison - a far cry from Audi's majestic glass-fronted headquarters in Ingolstadt. Executives under fire The Audi CEO was already known to be under scrutiny. A week before his arrest, his house was searched, by Munich prosecutors. He was named as one of 20 people being investigated as part of their enquiry. He was detained, according to prosecutors, because of concerns about the possible obstruction of justice. Mr Stadler has now stepped down from his posts, temporarily at least. But what many experts are puzzled by is why - whether or not he has actually done anything wrong - he was still in those posts at all. VW royalty Rupert Stadler is VW Group royalty. He has been in charge of Audi since 2007, and has sat on the main group board since 2010. Last year his contract was extended for five years - up to the end of 2022. That surprised many observers. Audi was heavily implicated in the diesel emissions scandal, which first came to light in September 2015. According to a statement agreed by VW with US prosecutors as part of a settlement last year, it was Audi engineers who first came up with the so-called ""defeat device"". This was software which put cars into a special test mode, enabling them to pass stringent US emissions tests, despite producing high levels of pollution when used on the road. It was later found to have been fitted to millions of cars around the world. Audi also designed and built 3 litre engines used by brands throughout the VW Group, which were later shown to be using the illegal software. When the wrongdoing came to light, the VW Group chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, lost his job. Since then many more executives and senior engineers have left. The company has thoroughly overhauled its management - and even Mr Winterkorn's successor, Matthias Mueller, was recently moved on. Yet until this week, Rupert Stadler remained firmly in his post. Last year, the company offered to install new engine software on 850,000 cars to reduce their emissions. In May it recalled a further 60,000 after discovering ""irregularities"" in their emissions controls. Even the news that Mr Stadler's house had been raided by prosecutors investigating the emissions scandal did not appear to set alarm bells ringing. ""It certainly raises questions about governance at Volkswagen and Audi"", says Arndt Ellinghorst, automotive analyst at Evercore ISI. ""Why did the police act and not the board of VW? I think he should have stepped down earlier. ""Whether you're guilty or not, if you're in charge you have to take responsibility"". A question of governance The reason he remained in his post may be down to the way Volkswagen is owned and run. A majority of the voting rights are held by Porsche SE. This is essentially an investment vehicle controlled by the Porsche and Piech families. They are descendants of Ferdinand Porsche, the man who invented the VW Beetle and founded the sportscar maker that bears his name. There are two other highly influential shareholders - the State of Lower Saxony and Qatar Holding, a division of the Qatar Investment Authority. According to Professor Ferdinand Dudenhoffer of the Center Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Mr Stadler had powerful backing. ""It's very surprising"", he says. ""Wolfgang Porsche, who represents the families, has supported Stadler since the beginning of the scandal. The Premier of Lower Saxony has also supported him"". ""When his house was searched, they didn't react. Then after his arrest, they took a whole day to react"". Arndt Ellinghorst agrees. ""It is extraordinary. It is a big setback in terms of the governance within Volkswagen"", he says. Breath of fresh air Since the scandal erupted, VW has had to set aside some $30bn to cover fines and settlements. Earlier this month it agreed to pay $1.2bn to settle criminal charges in Germany. In April, the company appointed a new CEO, Herbert Diess. A former BMW executive with a reputation as a ruthless decision maker, he joined VW a mere three years ago - and was welcomed by many outside experts as a breath of fresh air. His appointment coincided with a major restructuring of VW's management, designed to streamline decision making, and help speed up reform within the group. But the arrest of one of the Group's top executives while still in office suggests that the road to reform remains dauntingly long.",Rupert Stadler is the long-serving Chief Executive of VW's subsidiary Audi and a senior member of the group's management board.
"Delegates voted overwhelmingly in favour of the law on the final day of the National People's Congress (NPC). The measure is seen as a possible olive branch to the US as negotiators from both countries work to resolve their bruising trade dispute. But some argue it does not fully address the concerns foreign firms have about doing business in China. Delegates at the NPC - the annual meeting of China's legislature - passed the bill with 2,929 in favour, eight against and eight abstentions. The law will come into effect on 1 January 2020. It comes roughly three months after a first draft was discussed, a particularly fast turnaround in China, as Washington and Beijing work to resolve their trade dispute. The trade battle has seen both sides impose tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods since last year. The BBC's Stephen McDonell said the Chinese government appears to have rushed through the investment law as an olive branch to the US amid trade war negotiations. Many in the business community in China see this law as a kind of sweeping set of intentions rather than a specific, enforceable set of rules, he says. They fear it could be open to different and changing forms of interpretation. Read more from Stephen McDonell Industry concerns The new law aims to create a more level playing field between domestic and foreign businesses.

"The additional cost, for fixing engines in the United States, takes the total bill to $30bn. Two years after the problems first emerged, Volkswagen is still struggling to put the crisis behind it. Separately Munich prosecutors made an arrest in connection with the scandal. German media reports have named the person taken into custody as Wolfgang Hatz, former board member at VW unit Porsche. However there has been no official confirmation of his identity. Mr Hatz was head of Research and Development at VW-owned Porsche and had held other roles in the VW group, including in engine development at Audi. He was suspended after the diesel emissions test-cheating was exposed. He then left the company. Last year Porsche said no evidence had been found against him. Mr Hatz was reportedly close to former VW chief executive, Martin Winterkorn, who has denied any knowledge of the ""defeat devices"" which allowed vehicles to artificially reduce emissions during tests before their existence was exposed publicly. Another former Audi executive, Giovanni Pamio, was taken into custody earlier this year, at the request of the US Department of Justice. One man has so far been jailed in connection with the scandal: Volkswagen engineer James Liang received a 40 month sentence in a US court last month. 'Unexpected and unwelcome' News of the additional financial burden from dealing with vehicles in the United States underlines the difficulty the company is having extricating itself from the scandal. Shares in the German carmaker initially fell sharply on Friday although they later recovered most of the lost ground. ""This is yet another unexpected and unwelcome announcement from VW, not only from an earnings and cash flow perspective but also with respect to the credibility of management,"" said Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Evercore ISI. VW first admitted in September 2015 that it had used illegal software to cheat US emissions tests. Since then the firm has been adapting its cars to meet legal requirements. But the process in the United States is proving tougher than expected. It is also amending cars in Europe, but the process there is more straightforward, VW said. The additional costs will be reflected in VW's third quarter results, which will be reported next month.","The diesel emissions cheating scandal will cost Volkswagen an extra $3bn (€2.5bn), because engines are proving ""far more technically complex and time consuming"" to adapt the company said."

Alibaba is expected to launch its share sale next year and could be valued at more than $100bn (£64bn). Analysts said Yahoo was looking to cash in on the listing, not least because of Alibaba's continued growth. ""The idea is you don't want to have to sell at the initial public offering (IPO) price, you want to sell later to potentially get the appreciation going up,"" said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Research. Alibaba is China's largest e-commerce group and has been growing fast, raising speculation that its stock price will rise after listing as investors bet on continued growth. According to Yahoo, the Chinese firm's sales grew 61% in the April-to-June period to $1.74bn and net income jumped 160% to $717m. The announcement to hold to a higher stake came as Yahoo reported that its profits fell to $297m in the third quarter, compared to $3.16bn a year ago. However, the 2012 results included a $2.8bn gain from the sale of a part of its Alibaba holding. It also announced a slight fall in third quarter sales to $1.81bn.","Yahoo will keep a bigger stake in China's e-commerce giant Alibaba than originally planned, after the Chinese firm sells shares on the stock market."

"Ex-pensions minister Steve Webb urged caution over ""rushed changes"" he said could have implications for workers ""well beyond the steel industry"". A £485m pension deficit has been deterring potential buyers of Tata Steel's UK business. A consultation on the pension scheme's future has been launched by ministers. It includes a ""full range of options that consider whether and how the scheme could be separated from the existing sponsoring employer and whether it will be necessary to reduce the benefits within the scheme,"" the Department for Work and Pensions said in a statement. One option is to base the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure currently used. The plan has been supported by some union leaders and the British Steel Pension scheme. 'Pension security risk' In 2011 private sector pension schemes were given more freedom to move to the CPI measure, if their rules allowed it. Tata Steel is looking to sell its loss-making UK business. It has had seven expressions of interest and a shortlist is expected soon. Former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: ""The government is going down a very dangerous path. ""Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry."" There has been a suggestion that the new rules would stipulate that a company could only change their pension liabilities in an emergency. But, speaking to the BBC, Mr Webb said the term emergency was ""ill-defined"" and that companies could create them artificially in order to reduce their pension payouts. ""Once there's a loophole that says you can walk away from promises you've made. Other [companies] could walk away,"" he said, adding that he thought there could also be legal challenges. 'More generous' However, the trustees of the British Steel Pension Scheme welcomed the move, saying it was better than the alternative, which would see the scheme fall into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). ""Although this [government move] would entail future pension increases being cut back from their current levels, benefits would be more generous than those provided by the PPF for the vast majority of Scheme members,"" said Allan Johnston, chairman of the British Steel Pension Scheme. But Mark Turner of the Unite union cautioned that he wanted to see the detail. ""We don't want to make changes if they're going to be detrimental to the rest of industry,"" he told the BBC. In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members, one of the largest defined benefit schemes in the country. Further details are expected when Business Secretary Sajid Javid makes a statement later in the House of Commons. Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor The pension fund and its deficit have been a source of unease for the current owners Tata and a deal-breaker for any would-be buyers. Reducing its burden will make a sale easier and may even convince Tata to hang on to its UK steel business. Any such change would be very controversial as it would set what some would see as a dangerous precedent. The move is evidence of the business secretary's sense of urgency to resolve an industrial crisis which has put 10,000 steel workers' jobs in imminent danger. The BBC understands that union leaders have accepted that this proposal is a better deal than seeing the pension scheme shunted into the lifeboat of the Pensions Protection Fund, which can see some members lose 10% of their payout immediately and see lower increments in future years. Who are the potential bidders? Jack: How Excalibur and Liberty could join forces The rise and fall of Britain's steel industry Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said steel workers' pensions ""must be protected"". ""If these reports are accurate, the secretary of state for work and pensions should come to the House to explain precisely what is being proposed, including how current and future steel pensioners will be affected and what precedents might be set by any changes to hard-won pension protection legislation,"" he added.","The government has been warned that a plan to cut pension benefits to help save Tata Steel's UK operations could take ministers down a ""dangerous path""."
"By Rob YoungBBC World Service, Kampala The red, green and yellow peppers are destined for the supermarket shelves of Europe. ""Fresh Produce of Uganda"" is stamped proudly in large green letters on every side of each box. But far fewer Ugandan vegetables are being exported to Europe than was the case just a few months ago. The firm's director, John Kavuma, says the eurozone's debt crisis is to blame. ""The market was going up, and very fast, until recently. Then came the problem with the debt crisis in Europe and things really started affecting everybody,"" he laments. Widespread woe His customers in France, Holland and the UK have cut down on the amount they are buying, as governments there cut spending and consumers tighten their belts. ""These last two months, we have just been breaking even. We were thinking at one stage that maybe we should stop for a while,"" Mr Kavuma says, and to cut costs he has had to get rid of more than half of his workforce. Reduced global demand for Ugandan vegetables hits the country's farmers too. As well as vegetables, Uganda sells fruit, flowers, coffee, tea and fish to richer countries. Currency concerns There has been another impact - one that has affected the whole economy. The Ugandan currency, the shilling, has suffered a dramatic fall in value this year. At one point it was down by more than 20% against the US dollar as global investors pulled their money out of any asset they deemed risky. The shilling has recovered from some of that fall, but not enough to reverse all of its impact. It means imports, such as fuel, have become more expensive - and that pushes up the cost of transporting items such as meat, which in turn has exacerbated already-rising food prices in Uganda. At the end of October, inflation stood at 30%. Tough ride Motorcycle taxis - known as boda bodas - weave in and out of the cars on Kampala's clogged roads. These are the quickest way to get around the capital. Leaning on his bike, in a street near Kampala's parliament building, one boda boda rider, Seth, says life is tough now. ""Fuel was 2,500 shillings before. Now it is almost 4,000. It has almost doubled."" The income of the boda boda drivers is being squeezed several ways. Seth says he's been unable to increase his fares, and so the amount he earns has been massively reduced. ""You cannot charge passengers double. Their incomes have not doubled. He will not take you and you will get nothing,"" he explains. As a result of his falling income, Seth says he can no longer afford to eat meat and fish. ""I eat only beans. Why do I have to eat only beans when I am in my homeland?"" he asks. Bank intervention Uganda's authorities are trying to take measures they hope will mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis. The new Finance Minister, Maria Chiwanuka, says: ""It's very uncertain out there. We can't control what happens in Europe or China or Japan or even in Kenya. What we can control is what do we do to respond here within the country."" The central bank has intervened in the currency market and increased interest rates, hiking them to 23% at the beginning of November. That has led to a partial reversal of the falls in the dollar-shilling exchange rate. The bank hopes it will reduce inflation as well. Growth desired Ministers say they don't want to starting reducing their links to the global economy, as some people have suggested. ""The preferred response was to say: 'No, let us grow our way out of this,'"" says Ms Chiwanuka. But Ugandans are hurting, so her advice to the leaders of the G20 is: ""Get out of the crisis, stabilise and grow, and become good markets for us again."" Seth, the boda boda driver, puts it another way. ""I'm begging the white men, help us so we can stabilise our currency and develop.""","In a small open-air shed in a middle-class district of Uganda's capital Kampala, there are boxes and boxes of vegetables."
"Rough sleepers have been living under a busy junction in Newport for about two years and on Thursday the council cleaned the site next to a main road. It said support workers were working with rough sleepers on the site and they would keep their belongings safe. The council said homeless people could stay on the site after the ""tidy-up"". ""The council works proactively, with partners, to alleviate homelessness and rough sleeping and this includes frontline staff engaging directly with those on the streets,"" Newport council said in a statement. The authority added its housing needs team worked ""hard to help families and individuals that find themselves in such difficult circumstances"". One lane of the A4042 Usk Way road that runs through the city centre was shut when the work was carried out ""to enable the work to take place as quickly and safely as possible"". ""People who are homeless and approach the council are helped to find immediate emergency accommodation and then assisted with longer-term solutions,"" added the council. The council said it worked closely with Gwent Police and homeless charities, but this depended on ""the engagement of individuals, some of whom have multiple support needs"". ""But that will not stop us continuing to reach out to offer help and advice,"" it added. ""The council also has to balance the needs and safety of other residents and businesses in the city centre in relation to sites used by people who are sleeping rough.""","Bedding, general waste and syringes were among the things removed from a city centre homeless site after ""complaints from the public""."
"The firm, which owns the Trafford Centre, the Lakeside complex, and Braehead, said earlier it had not reached an agreement in financial restructuring talks with its lenders. Its centres will stay open under administrators KPMG. The company said shares listed on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges had been suspended. The significance of Intu's collapse ""cannot be understated,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics. The coronavirus lockdown is speeding up a trend towards buying more consumer goods online, he said. He estimates 50% of workers normally can't receive parcels at work. 'Too much retail space' But with many people spending most of their time at home, and car journeys to shopping centres discouraged, many of those people are now ordering via websites. How landlords should react is a difficult question and there won't be a simple solution that will work for every mall, he says. Particularly hard-hit will be shops at large office developments like Canary Wharf if more people are working from home. ""It's going to be a really, really tough challenge. There's no getting away from the fact we have too much retail space."" While more retailers and shopping centres are likely to close, landlords can offer shorter, flexible leases, he said, to attract retailers with new ideas. The firm said it had appointed three administrators at the KPMG accountancy firm and that ""the appointment is expected to become effective shortly"". The company was one of the UK's biggest shopping centre groups, with 17 centres in the UK. In Nottingham, where it owns the Victoria Centre, shoppers said they hoped stores would remain open. One worker at the local Boots, who didn't give her name, said she didn't know yet whether her shop will be affected. ""I think we'll all be worried,"" she told the BBC. Intu had been struggling even before the coronavirus outbreak with about £4.6bn worth of debt. Intu has a hugely complicated corporate structure. Although the company's gone into administration, its shopping centres haven't. They are separate companies owned by a myriad of banks and lenders. And they've now got the keys. Shoppers aren't likely to notice any real difference in the short term. But buyers will be sought. The jewel in the crown is Manchester's Trafford Centre, followed by Lakeside. But Intu's less-popular malls will prove more difficult to sell, especially given the turmoil in retail right now. Intu is a property business which basically put all its eggs in one basket, buying more malls as shopping habits changed, and it ended up with way too much debt. Coronavirus then compounded its problems. Intu's spectacular collapse also highlights the pressures retail landlords are now under given the big slump in rental income from their tenants. According to its annual report, published in March, its debts were worth 68% of its assets, a jump from 53% a year earlier. It told investors earlier this month that it expected rent collected for 2020 to drop to £310m from £492m a year earlier. According to Property Week, landlords collected just 18% of commercial rents for the three months to 24 June. As rent payments dried up and property values fell, its prospects declined. The company employs 2,500 people and its wider supply chain supports about 130,000 jobs, which will now be in doubt. Intu's centres were partially shut during the coronavirus lockdown, with only essential shops remaining open. The company had about 60% of shopping centre staff and about 20% of head office employees on furlough. Investors in the company's shares will be nursing heavy losses. Its shares traded as cheaply as 1.2 pence each early on Friday, valuing the company at £16m. It was worth as much as £13bn in 2006.","The owner of some of the UK's biggest shopping centres, Intu, has called in administrators."
"The regulator Ofgem will run a trial - to be launched in the next few weeks - which could offer savings of up to £300 a year for each customer. It will be based on the idea of ""collective"" switching, where large numbers of consumers swap supplier in one go. Eligible customers will have been on a standard tariff for over three years. About 57% of households are currently on such tariffs, which are the most expensive. Despite previous incentives to switch to cheaper fixed-term deals, many people have been reluctant to do so. Ofgem said it had already chosen one of the big six energy suppliers to run the trial, but it has not revealed which one. It will also appoint a consumer partner to help with the switch - possibly a switching site, or a consumer group. Ofgem said it would be easier for customers to take part in the trial than in typical collective switching deals. That is because they will not need to enter the details of their existing tariff. What is collective switching? A number of organisations, including switching sites, newspapers and even local authorities, have helped groups of several thousand people move supplier in one go. The economies of scale enable them to negotiate lower prices. It is claimed that some groups have saved more than £350 a year for each member by switching collectively. However, critics say the deals on offer are not necessarily the cheapest on the market. Fresh campaign The government announced at the weekend that it was considering sharing information with energy suppliers, to let them know which households claim state benefits. This would enable such households to have their bills capped by Ofgem, alongside 5 million other vulnerable customers, who are now on the ""safeguard"" tariff. At the same time, Ofgem is launching a new trial to persuade customers on expensive standard variable tariffs to change supplier. As many as 250,000 households will be sent two letters or emails from their energy firm, telling them about three cheaper deals they could benefit from. This will include tariffs from rival suppliers. A similar trial last year resulted in a trebling of switching rates. In 2017, 18% of consumers switched their electricity suppliers and 19% switched their gas suppliers, the highest rates for nearly a decade. The government is pressing ahead with plans to cap the bills of 11 million consumers who remain on standard variable tariffs.","A special switching deal to help people reduce their energy bills is to be offered to about 50,000 households."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Every home in Britain is supposed to have a smart meter, which avoids the need for customer readings, by the end of 2020. However, installation dropped by 16% in the final three months of 2018 compared with the same period the year before. Changing technology was one reason given for the slowdown. Smart Energy GB, which promotes smart meter technology, said that suppliers have been planning for a switch to second generation smart meters. This would have played a part in the falling installation rate among large suppliers. The fitting rate among the larger suppliers in the final quarter of 2018 was down 2% on the previous three months. Deadline 'should be extended' By the end of 2018, 12.65 million smart meters were in operation in British homes, representing 25% of all domestic meters. Of these, 240,000 were second generation - or SMETS2 meters - which keep their smart operation when customers switch supplier. Most of the earlier versions go ""dumb"" at the point of switching, although a technology upgrade, without the need for another visit from an engineer, has been promised. Gillian Guy, from Citizens Advice, said: ""It is worrying that at this key moment, when the switch to second generation smart meters should be accelerating, installation rates overall are actually slowing down. ""Smart meters will provide benefits for customers, but with the rollout beset by technical problems, the current timetable is unrealistic. There's little chance that the 2020 deadline will be met, it should be extended to 2023."" Natalie Hitchins, from consumer group Which?, said: ""These latest figures show suppliers have a mountain to climb. ""All parties involved should be focusing their resources on ensuring the rollout delivers on the promise to bring greater convenience and a more competitive energy market - not just hassle and soaring costs for customers, funded by their very own bills."" In November, the National Audit Office (NAO) said that there was ""no realistic prospect"" of the government meeting its own deadline to install smart meters by the end of 2020. However, a spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said: ""We've said everyone will be offered a smart meter by the end of 2020 to reap these benefits and we will meet that commitment."" Why are smart meters important? Smart meters are designed to save consumers money, as it is said that they encourage householders to use less power. Because they can be read remotely, the costs to industry are also lower. They also enable consumers to use cheaper tariffs, by using power in the evening or at weekends. Four years ago, BEIS estimated that they would save consumers about £26 a year. However, the NAO says the increasing cost of installing them will now save consumers less than £11 annually","The rate at which smart meters are being fitted has slowed, adding more pressure on a 2020 deadline already branded as unrealistic."
"It is understood that Pret's owner, Bridgepoint Advisers, is considering a range of options which may include floating the business in New York. The US is a growing market for Pret where sales at its 74 outlets surpassed $200m for the first time last year. Bridgepoint is in the process of naming advisers to examine Pret's next step. A spokesman for Bridgepoint said: ""As a committed shareholder in Pret we are always exploring appropriate opportunities to ensure the future growth of the company. ""If such opportunities materialise, we will update the market."" During 2016, Pret opened 50 new shops including five in the US - where it reported strong growth in breakfast food and coffee sales. By the end of last year it had 444 stores and announced a 15% rise in revenues to £776.2m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation up 11% to £93.2m. It is the third time that Pret a Manger has considered an initial public offering. Its founders Julian Metcalfe and Sinclair Beecham considered the move in 2001 but instead provoked controversy when they sold a 33% stake in the business to US fast food giant McDonald's for £50m. In 2007, just before the financial crisis, a flotation was on the cards again but Pret was eventually sold for £350m to Bridgepoint and Goldman Sachs. Mr Metcalfe and Mr Beecham reportedly made £50m each when they handed over ownership of the business they founded in 1986.",People who love their Pret a Manager sandwiches may soon be able to own a slice of the chain amid reports it may become a public company.
"By Dominic O'ConnellToday business presenter The only problem is that about three-quarters of the industry - the track, signalling and big stations - are already under public control. They were recaptured not by a reforming Corbynist minister, but by the Blairite transport secretary Stephen Byers. When he withdrew support from Railtrack, the privatised owner of the network, in 2001, it collapsed into administration. From the wreckage was born Network Rail, a not-for-profit organisation whose debts now count as part of public borrowing, and whose budgets and priorities are set in Whitehall. What remains in the private sector are the companies that run the trains - the 25 rail franchises - and the companies that own the trains. When Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell talks about a return to public control, he means the former. Mr McDonnell told the BBC in an interview that if Labour were elected it would bring them back in, then reverse the historic split between track and train created at privatisation. He said he would aim for the ""the greatest possible integration"", claiming it would lead to efficiencies and a better railway. In short, he wants to bring back British Rail. Those with experience of British Rail and the privatised industry are not as gung-ho as Mr McDonnell. Michael Holden, the respected executive who was called in to run the government's Directly Operated Railways when the east coast main line went awry in 2007, said the tyranny of the annual budgets hampered British Rail. ""You were always competing for money with education and health. The end result was that we never had enough money,"" he said. The private industry has invested more - there are fleets of new trains, and ridership has doubled since privatisation - but the railway still relies heavily on state support. Even after premium payments from rail franchises are taken into account, the government last year put £3.3bn into the industry, down from £3.8bn a decade earlier. Most of that went to Network Rail as a direct grant. The cost of improving the railway has also escalated since privatisation. Roger Ford, the technical editor of Modern Railways and a seasoned observer of the industry, said a prime example was the price of electrification - putting in the equipment necessary to run electric rather than diesel trains. The cost of the latest big scheme undertaken by Network Rail - on the Great Western Main Line - had ended up being roughly six times as expensive as the last similar scheme project done by British Rail. Mr Ford said while some cost escalation was to be expected, ""we don't really know why"" current costs were so great. Paul Plummer, chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group, which industry's umbrella body, said nationalisation ""would not help the fundamental issues we face."" Mr McDonnell indicated in an interview with the BBC that a Labour government would be unlikely to try and buy back franchises, offering their owners compensation - the approach he has advocated with a planned renationalisation of water companies - but might instead simply wait for existing franchises to expire.","Labour wants to bring the railways back under public control - a policy that has garnered widespread support from a travelling public irritated by fare rises, overcrowded trains and a sense that train companies have profited while passengers have not."
"Speaking at the forum, Mr Xi vowed to ensure transparency and the ""fiscal sustainability"" of all projects. The initiative is seen by some as a bid for geopolitical influence and has been criticised for indebting recipient countries. Mr Xi also sought to address key US trade concerns ahead of talks between the two countries next week. Speaking on the second day of the Belt and Road summit, Mr Xi said the aim of the infrastructure programme was ""to enhance connectivity and practical cooperation"". The ambitious initiative, which is expected to involve more than $1 trillion in investments, has already funded trains, roads, and ports in many countries. He said the programme was about jointly ""delivering win-win outcomes and common development"". ""Everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption,"" he said. ""We also need to ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned."" Beijing is showcasing its flagship infrastructure project at the three-day forum, hosting world leaders including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. The project has been criticised for leaving some countries saddled with debt, with Sri Lanka forced to hand over control of a port in 2017 to pay back some of its foreign loans. Trade talks looming With trade talks between the US and China due to resume next week, Mr Xi also sought to address some of the key points under dispute. Negotiations between the two countries have been ongoing since December when both sides agreed to suspend tit-for-tat tariffs. The US accuses China of stealing intellectual property and wants Beijing to make changes to its economic policies, which it says unfairly favour domestic companies through subsidies. It also wants China to buy more US goods to rein in a lofty trade deficit. China accuses the US of launching the largest trade war in economic history and many there see the trade war as part of US efforts to curb its rise. In his speech, Mr Xi said China would boost efforts to secure intellectual property protection, increase imports of goods and services and ensure a fair trading environment for firms, while also stressing the need for equitable treatment. ""We will overhaul and abolish unjustified regulations, subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market,"" Mr Xi said. ""We hope that other countries will also create an enabling environment of investment, treat Chinese enterprises, students and scholars as equals, and provide a fair and friendly environment for them to engage in normal international exchanges and cooperation.""",China's President Xi Jinping has sought to ease concerns about its Belt and Road project at a summit in Beijing.
"By Felicity HannahWake up to Money, BBC Radio 5 live Recently she awarded herself a £7,000 pay rise, taking her annual salary to £37,000. ""I felt a lot of doubts asking for that raise,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money. ""It took a lot of talks with other people. I was aware that my job had changed. I was aware I was going way beyond my targets. ""I knew that from a rational point of view I deserved that higher rate. But I had a lot of self-doubt and I felt sort of greedy because there's always a stigma - a sense you should feel happy with what you have. ""When I spoke with my colleagues internally and asked for advice, the advice they gave me was that yes I did deserve it and I was worth it."" Her employer, GrantTree, helps UK business get government funding and all of its 45 staff set their own salary, which they can review as often as they like. Self-set pay is the latest innovation among companies that are competing for the top talent and want to show they offer the most attractive employment terms. 'No-one says no' The exact process varies from company to company. At GrantTree staff first gather information about what others are paid elsewhere for roles similar to their own, Cecilia told BBC Radio 5 Live's Wake Up To Money, in other words how much the firm would have to spend to replace them. Then they look at how much the company can afford to pay them, and think about how much they have grown as individuals since they first started. ""Based on this data you make a proposal that is reviewed by colleagues,"" says Cecilia. ""This is quite important, because colleagues are not there to say yes or no, or to approve it. They are there to ask questions and give you some feedback. After that feedback the employee decides on a figure. ""The key point is that nobody has to prove it; once you make a decision that pay now happens,"" she says. What goes up Cecilia says that two members of staff at GrantTree actually chose to voluntarily reduce their pay after their responsibilities changed. Most companies operating pick-your-own pay schemes have some sort of check, whether that's scrutiny from colleagues or an upper limit on the total salaries paid out. The human resources professionals organisation, the CIPD, told the BBC that this way of working can increase pay transparency. However, it warned the strategy could also backfire without careful implementation, just as unlimited holiday meant some staff actually took less time off than before. For Charles Towers-Clark, the boss of software firm Pod Group, the system seems to work smoothly. His 45 employees have chosen their own pay for two years now, leading to a 10% increase in total salaries paid and a huge increase in staff retention. 'Are you worth it?' If someone at Pod Group wants to increase their salary, they tell the HR director who appoints six staff to provide feedback. Occasionally staff have asked for far more than the market rate, he admits. ""It's not people being greedy, it's a lack of understanding,"" he says. ""A fairly junior person didn't comprehend that the salary increase she was asking for was too much, she was asking for a 50% increase on her salary, which was far more than the role was worth. ""It was her decision but I told her: 'you can take it but if you become uneconomical or your value is not justified then that will only end one way'. ""She reduced what she was asking for after that."" Within budget Tom Hardman is chief operating officer for Smarkets, where 120 staff set their own salaries. Like Pod Group, they share data and company information with staff to ensure their salary requests are informed and reasonable. ""A very important part of the salary process is making sure employees understand budgets need to be adhered to,"" he explains. ""So as part of any salary process we have a discussion about what resources are available, what cash we have in the bank and how much we can afford to spend on salaries. ""As long as we bring people along on that discussion we tend to find that people are very responsible when given this power."" Battle over At the moment, the trend for allowing employees to set their own pay is limited to just a handful of companies, mostly in the tech sector. But if it is a success, then it could spread, helping to end the traditional workplace taboo against discussing your salary with colleagues. Certainly for Cecilia, this method of setting pay has transformed her relationship with her co-workers, making it more open and less adversarial. ""The colleagues who give you feedback make sure you are not underselling yourself and that you are getting rewarded for as much as you are worth. ""That doesn't really happen in a normal company where you negotiate for your salary and you are trying to get as much as you can but the other person is trying to give you as little as possible."" You can hear more on this story by listening to the Wake Up To Money podcast on BBC Sounds.","Where 25-year-old Cecilia Manduca works there is a ""pay self-assessment process"". Put simply, the workers there decide how much they are worth and should be paid."
"The £11.7bn project will start in the autumn of 2015, rather than the summer of next year, the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) said. It said that the industry needed more time to design, build and test the communications system required. The devices show exactly how much gas and electricity is being used. This should bring an end to estimated bills, because the technology could send back an accurate meter reading to an energy company every day. According to the industry, the technological advance would be the equivalent of using wireless broadband instead of sending a telegram. Preparation The project is considered vital in attempts to cut energy use by households as the UK faces having to import more energy in the future. The smart meter rollout has been criticised in the past, but the then energy minister, Charles Hendry, said last January: ""The last thing we need is more dither and delay."" Now, the programme to install these meters into every UK home is expected to be finished by 2020, also a year later than planned. Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, said she was disappointed because smart meters would have ""huge benefits"", but added that it was ""more important to get it right so that it works for consumers"". Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, which represents the major energy companies, said: ""We welcome the government's prudent decision to allow an additional 12 months to complete the smart meter programme. This recognises the scale of the programme and the need to prepare carefully."" She said the installation of meters was a complex task and the delay allowed this to take place ""in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, and to greater effect"". Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ""Completing the national rollout will be an enormous logistical and technical challenge for the industry. Getting this right for consumers is the government's priority."" Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ""Delaying the date for the smart meter roll-out is a sensible move. The programme is not ready. It will cost consumers around £11bn and unless it goes through a hard and rigorous test it could just mean more costs and fewer benefits for consumers."" Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which?, said: ""The government is right to take its time to ensure the installation of smart meters in every home is a success but it should use this delay to trial regional roll-outs, similar to the digital TV switchover. ""With energy prices one of the top financial concerns for consumers, the government must also make sure the £11bn cost does not spiral out of control."" Last year, MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee said it was ""far from certain"" consumers would benefit from smart meter savings and urged ministers to oversee the rollout more closely.","The introduction of energy smart meters in 30 million UK homes will be delayed for more than a year, the government has announced."
"The announcement came as it suspended its dividend and reported a loss in the first half of its financial year. De La Rue said its warning was based on a worst-case scenario. However, it concluded that there was ""a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt on the group's ability to operate as a going concern"". UK-based De La Rue prints cash for about 140 central banks and employs more than 2,500 people globally. All current Bank of England banknotes are printed by the firm at a site in Debden, Essex. It is unclear what would happen if the firm got into difficulties, but it is likely that a rival would take over its Bank of England contract. Its main competitors are all based outside the UK. The BBC understands that preparations have already been made for the launch of the new £20 note featuring artist JMW Turner, printed by De La Rue, which enters circulation on 20 February next year. Shares in De la Rue fell 20% on Tuesday morning. De La Rue has faced some big setbacks in the past two years, including the loss of the post-Brexit UK passport printing contract to a Franco-Dutch firm last year. In May last year, it had to write off £18m after Venezuela's central bank failed to pay its bills. The company is also under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with ""suspected corruption"" in South Sudan. It appointed a new chief executive, Clive Vacher, in October as part of a management shake-up. What is De la Rue? Around 11% of the 171 billion banknotes issued globally in 2017 were printed by a handful of commercial printers. De La Rue is now the largest of these firms. It began producing banknotes in 1860, first for Mauritius and then elsewhere. Today it produces enough notes each week that if stacked up would reach the peak of Everest twice. Its main competitor, German company Giesecke & Devrient, produces notes for roughly 100 central banks, while the Canadian Banknote Company and US-founded Crane Currency are also major players. 'Teetering on the brink' De La Rue reported a £12.1m pre-tax loss for the six months to 28 September, compared with a £7.1m profit in the same period last year. In its results statement, the company said it was accelerating its restructuring plan, including a reduction in overhead costs. It is also planning new banknote security feature products to bolster its position in the ""increasingly competitive"" banknote market. ""De La Rue is teetering on the brink,"" said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com. ""Bad management and decisions seems to be the main reason for the malaise."" Investors sometimes wonder whether a company's board of directors can, in the short term, have much sway over a company's trading. The scepticism is warranted: boards normally comprise a small number of executives and a larger number of non-executive directors, who have no involvement with day-to-day operations, and there are plenty of examples of companies going off the rails without the board suspecting anything was wrong. Today's results from De La Rue show, however, that boards are vital. The banknote and secure-printing company turned in a disastrous set of numbers - a £10m operating loss, a string of one-off charges and mounting debt - which it blamed on falling demand and too many companies chasing too few contracts. But it also admits that a period of unprecedented turmoil at the top has not helped, with the chairman, chief executive, finance director and most of the other directors changing in short order. ""The board believes that significant changes in the board and executive teams, along with a restructuring of the business, has contributed to the poor performance of the business in the period,"" the results statement says. ""This has contributed to a larger variance between forecasts and performance than has been experienced historically."" Management matters, and will matter even more in the next few months. The directors warn that if the revival plan put in place by (newish) chief executive Clive Vacher does not yield results, there is a threat to the company being able to continue as a going concern. In plain English, that means it will have to find more money, either by renegotiating the terms of its bank loans or by asking shareholders to stump up more cash.","De La Rue, the company that prints the UK's banknotes, has said there is a risk that the firm will collapse if its turnaround plan fails to work."
"By Oliver SmithBusiness reporter, BBC News Chris Williamson, a Rotherham steel worker, is contemplating the potential closure of the plant where he's worked for 26 years, and the impact it would have on the community. His dad worked there for four decades, and his brother works in the steel supply chain. Steel is very much a family business. ""Rotherham is a steel town, its recognised as a steel town. It's fundamental to Rotherham's image. It's vital. For every one of our jobs, there's another two or three in the supply chain,"" says Chris, who's also a local rep for the steel union, Community. ""If we go by the wayside, who's going to pay our wages here? We get a decent wage but we're in a dangerous industry. Where else are we going to get a job like that? It would just be a domino effect of people suffering. In the end, you'll end up with a town full of shopkeepers and no one to buy anything, because they haven't got the income."" Over the decades steel workers like Chris have seen a fair amount of upheaval at the Rotherham plant, and a number of different owners too. First Corus, then Tata, and now Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Steel, which is battling to secure finance for Rotherham and 11 other sites across the UK, employing 5,000 people. Tonight, it's emerged that Mr Gupta has written to the government, requesting a £170m bailout for his steel businesses. The government won't comment on the request, but says it's monitoring the situation closely. The Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs on Thursday that the government is looking at all options to make sure Liberty Steel does not collapse. Much of the work at Rotherham has ground to a halt, with Chris and many of his colleagues placed on furlough. He's due back at work on 14 April, but it's all very uncertain. 'Nervousness and frustration' ""There's nervousness, but also a bit of frustration,"" he says. ""We were aspiring to be a super plant, making a million tons of steel a year. We've got a full order book, and yet here we are, furloughed."" Despite his current financial woes, Sanjeev Gupta still has a lot of support from steelworkers across the country, including Chris. ""Everybody's a bit bemused by his business models. But when Sanjeev first arrived he was very well received because Tata declared they didn't want us, so we were basically on the scrap heap. Without Sanjeev, we wouldn't be here, so we've got to be thankful for that."" He adds: ""Just because he's hitting a bit of trouble, we can't just bin him. We've got to take him at his word at the moment, and hopefully we can ride this out."" Chris isn't the only one scratching his head about Liberty's financial situation. It's a complicated picture. Finance company Greensill Capital was the main lender to Mr Gupta's sprawling steel empire. It helped speed up cash flow for businesses by paying their invoices immediately, and recovering the money from customers later, for a fee. But it went bust at the beginning of the month, leaving Liberty starved of cash. 'The beating heart of the community' You can't miss the steel plant in Stocksbridge, Rotherham's sister site 12 miles down the road, just outside Sheffield. The building, which has been home to a steelworks since the mid 19th Century, sits at the bottom of the valley, and its dominance goes way beyond its physical presence at the centre of the town. ""It's the beating heart of the community,"" says Tracey Martin, who's owned Samuel's Cafe across the road from the site for the past 20 years. Stocksbridge makes specialist steel products for the aviation industry, which has itself been laid low by the pandemic. Like the Rotherham site, many staff are currently furloughed and it's already affecting local businesses such as Tracey's. At least 50% of her customers are steel workers. ""We've seen a big difference to our business already with the workers on furlough,"" says Tracey. ""If the steelworks were to go, it would affect every single business in the town, but it goes far beyond the valley with the supply chain that people don't realise exists. It affects a lot of livelihoods."" She's hopeful that the site will be rescued. ""Ever since I've owned my cafe, there have been issues with the steel works but luckily, there has always been a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel which keeps them going. We're just hoping that the government or someone can step in temporarily until a new buyer can be found."" Tracey says a lot of businesses were already struggling because of Covid, and the ""news about the works has topped it off"". At its peak in the 1970s, the UK steel industry employed hundreds of thousands of people, a significant number of them in South Yorkshire. One of Tracey's regulars, John, used to work at the plant. He says the steel industry in the area is a shadow of its former self. ""When I was an apprentice, there were 9,500 people working in steel around this area. Now it's only around 650. ""The products they make here are so highly specialised, for the oil industry and aviation. If it was to go, it would be a huge loss to the country, not just this area,"" says John. UK steel needs help to compete Many steel analysts would agree. Chris McDonald is a former executive at Tata Steel, and now runs the Materials Processing Institute on Teesside. He says that despite the recent downturn in demand for steel due to the pandemic, the market is now growing again, particularly for the type of specialist steel made at sites such as Rotherham and Stocksbridge. ""The fundamentals of the business are still right, so Liberty might just need some support to be able to ride out this dip in the market,"" says Chris. ""Then as that market comes back up we can expect their business to come back up as well."" But he says the UK steel industry is falling behind global rivals, particularly in Europe, and that it needs to be put on a sustainable footing with ongoing support. ""The government could buy more UK produced steel for infrastructure projects, the way the French government do. Or they could support more equal energy prices, the way the German government do. Either or both of these things could help the UK industry to compete on level terms."" Back in Rotherham, despite the current owner's problems, Chris Williamson is also optimistic that the town can continue to make steel for many years to come. ""We can spend the next 30 years at least making steel here. We just need a bit of faith. The last 12 years have been like a rollercoaster. But I do think we have got a future."" He adds: ""Whether it's with Sanjeev, I don't know.""","""It's frightening. I don't like to think about it."""
"But shares have tumbled since October, retreating to lower levels than at the start of the year. That decline continued on Friday, as weak economic data in Europe and China sparked a late afternoon sell-off, sending all three major US share indexes lower. The Nasdaq dropped almost 2.3%, the Dow fell 2% and the S&P 500 sank 1.9%. For those invested in US stocks, the double-digit gains in seven of the last 10 years may still feel pretty good. But as Wall Street debate turns to just when a recession might begin, many investors are bracing for a rough patch. What's behind the shift in sentiment? 1. The tech boom was overblown. At their peaks this year, the Dow and S&P 500 were up about 8% since the start of 2018. The Nasdaq had increased 15%. But the stock market surge was always a bit suspect. It outpaced other economic measures by a large margin and was driven by the tech sector, which accounted for roughly half of the gains on the S&P 500 up until mid-August of this year. Now some of the biggest winners - such as Apple and Facebook - have stumbled, dragging down the markets and making the weakness elsewhere more visible. All three indexes are off 10% from their earlier peaks - a decline often considered a correction. Until tech recovers, a broader market bounce is unlikely, said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at US Bank Wealth Management. ""Looking to 2019, volatility is likely to represent the norm rather than the exception,"" he says. ""By many measures, the degree of investment difficulty is on the rise."" 2. Interest rates are rising. US central bankers have been raising interest rates since 2015, moving away from the unusually low rates put in place during the financial crisis as economic growth rebounds. Analysts are worried about how much more expensive borrowing might get - and whether companies and households will be able to handle the increased costs. Fears have been tempered recently by signals from the US Fed suggesting it may enact fewer rates rises in 2019 than previously expected. But some still worry about the risks from corporate debt levels, which have hit historic highs - with an increasing percentage of the loans made to companies with already large debt loads. 3. US economic growth is slowing. US growth is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2019, down from about 3% this year, according to the IMF and Federal Reserve. Some closely watched industries and financial indicators are already flashing warning signs of a more serious contraction. In October, sales of existing homes had fallen more than 5% compared to 2017. Construction spending has started to slip and growth in consumer spending been less robust than expected. Meanwhile, business optimism is in retreat. Indeed, nearly half of US financial officers believe the nation's economy will enter a recession by the end of 2019, a recent Duke University survey found. 4. The White House is a wild card, especially its trade policy. Investors loved US President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts. But his trade policy has them tied up in knots. In March, Mr Trump ordered tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, as well as on billions of dollars worth in annual trade from China. He's threatened more, including on foreign cars. The tariffs have already raised costs for US companies - and economists warn they threaten to slow growth, adding to recession worries. Markets aren't sure about White House strategy, and an ongoing investigation of Mr Trump's election campaign ties to Russia has only added to uncertainty emanating from Washington. ""If these investigations produce some sort of smoking gun that throws us into a constitutional crisis, that might prove destabilising,"" says Mark Vitner, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. 5. Threats from overseas - like Brexit. The IMF expects the global economy to expand 3.7% in 2019, but the growth has become more uneven. The US Federal Reserve recently flagged issues in Europe, China and emerging markets as some of the biggest threats to the American economy, with Brexit high on the list. Indeed, as much as US indexes are down, financial markets elsewhere have dropped even farther. The Global Dow is down around nearly 9% so far this year, and the MSCI world index is down about 8%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index has fallen about 6%; Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is about 13% lower in 2018. The Shanghai Composite has dropped more than 20%. The Stoxx Europe 600 is off almost 11%. France's CAC 40 has dropped almost 9%, London's FTSE 100 has declined nearly 11%. and Germany's DAX is down more than 15%. So stormy seas likely lie ahead.","Just a few months ago, US financial markets seemed headed for a third year in a row of hefty increases."
"This upfront package has now been scrapped, and more of Mr Lund's pay will be based on performance. A ""significant number of shareholders"" questioned Mr Lund's pay award BG said. Also, the Institute of Directors (IoD) took the unusual step of criticising the pay award last week. But on Monday, Simon Walker, director general of the IoD, welcomed the revised deal, saying the company had ""listened to the concerns of its shareholders."" Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at Legal & General Investment Management, added: ""We are encouraged to see BG responding positively to shareholders' concerns. As long term engaged investors we look forward to the new CEO joining and creating shareholder value for all."" BG had initially agreed to pay Mr Lund a basic salary of £1.5m, plus £450,000 a year in lieu of pension contributions. He was also granted up to £480,000 to relocate to the UK from Norway, where he was chief executive of oil firm Statoil. In addition to his basic salary, Mr Lund's contract included two different bonuses: one in cash up to a value of £3m a year, and one in shares, up to a value of six times his basic salary, equal to £9m. Performance based In total, Mr Lund could have earned up to £12m a year in bonus awards, on top of the £12m initial shares bonus he would have received on taking up his post as chief executive in March 2015 and base annual salary of £1.95m. It would have meant a potential pay package in Mr Lund's first year of nearly £26m. BG said on Monday that the initial shares bonus had been scrapped after shareholder's raised concerns that the pay award was contrary to the company's ""remuneration policy"", which had been agreed six months earlier at a shareholder meeting. Under the new remuneration package, Mr Lund can earn up to £10.6m in shares over the next five years in place of the initial £12m shares award, but only if certain specific performance targets are achieved, including that BG's share price outperforms its rivals. BG said that in reality it expects this bonus to amount to £4.7m, which over five years would add £960,000 to Mr Lund's annual salary. The oil and gas firm added that 62% of Mr Lund's salary in the first year was now performance based, and that Mr Lund had indicated that he intended to hold his shares for the duration of his time as chief executive. None of the shares bonuses will vest for five years and Mr Lund will not receive the first shares bonus until 2018. 'Constructive role' BG said in its statement that a ""significant number of shareholders questioned the structure of the package, in particular whether it was appropriate to go outside the remuneration policy approved by shareholders earlier this year. ""Both the board and Mr Lund recognise and wish to respond to shareholder concerns. The board welcomes the active and constructive role played by Mr Lund in revising the remuneration package so that all elements fall entirely within the company's current policy."" Mr Walker said: ""The Institute of Directors applauds the revisions to its CEO's proposed remuneration. Mr Lund's pay now conforms with the policy guidelines agreed by shareholders in May and is subject to quantifiable performance targets,"" he added. ""While substantial, the total remuneration is reduced and now falls within proper limits for a company of BG's size and international importance. We continue to welcome Helge Lund's appointment and wish him and BG well in the challenges they face.""",Oil and gas giant BG Group has revised the pay award granted to its incoming chief executive Helge Lund after some shareholders threatened a revolt over a £12m upfront shares bonus.
"Officials said they were ""broadly comfortable"" with plans to scale back the Fed's $85bn (£54bn) a month bond-buying programme. However, the timing remains murky. Almost all agreed a change in the programme was ""not yet appropriate"" but ""a few"" favoured swift action. Fed officials said that recent economic data had been ""mixed"", which could indicate that plans to begin the so-called ""taper"" might be put off if the economy were to weaken. The central bankers will reconvene on 17 September for a two-day meeting, which will be followed by a press conference by chairman Ben Bernanke. Market uncertainty The Dow tumbled by more than 100 points after the minutes were released, although quickly recovered. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also fell briefly. ""I think if people were looking for additional clarity they got additional obfuscation,"" Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&P Capital IQ, told the BBC. Mr Stovall said the minutes ""added to the uncertainty as to when the tapering will actually take place"". After Mr Bernanke hinted at plans to end the bank's accommodating monetary policy in June, mortgage rates jumped sharply, threatening a fragile housing recovery. Fed officials acknowledged that market reaction to discussion of an easing of expansionary monetary policy has been volatile. ""Meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation,"" according to the minutes. The September Federal Open Market Committee meeting will occur after a spate of economic data has been released, including another jobs report as well as revised second-quarter GDP estimates. Officials hope this new data will help give them a better sense of when tapering should begin, which many investors believe will happen sometime before the end of this year. Mr Bernanke has indicated that the timing of the Fed's decision will be dependent on a healthy US economy.",Minutes of the US Federal Reserve's July meeting revealed few clues about the central bank's timeline for unwinding its extraordinary efforts to support the US economy.
"By Szu Ping ChanBusiness reporter, BBC News Now, the Bank of England has signalled that it may take the cost of borrowing below zero. Last month, the Bank started new work on how negative interest rates could affect banks and the wider economy. But what exactly are negative interest rates? And could a world where savers are penalised and borrowers rewarded end up doing more harm than good? What are negative interest rates? The term ""interest rates"" is often used interchangeably with the Bank of England base rate. Described as the ""single most important interest rate in the UK"", the base rate determines how much interest the Bank of England pays to financial institutions that hold money with it, and what it charges them to borrow. High street banks also use it to determine how much interest they pay to savers, as well as what they charge people who take out a loan or mortgage. The Bank of England usually lowers interest rates when it wants people to spend more and save less. It cut them to a fresh low of 0.1% in March to try to stimulate the economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. In theory, taking interest rates below zero should have the same effect. But in practice, it's a bit more complicated. After all, why would anyone pay to stash money in a savings account or lend someone money, when they can keep the cash at home for free? Why might this happen now? The Bank of England's number one job is to keep prices across the economy rising steadily every year. This is known as the Bank's inflation target, which is set at 2% by the government. Inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), fell to 0.8% in April, from 1.5% in March. While this means the cost of living is rising more slowly, if inflation remains low for too long, bosses start factoring that into pay reviews. This can then dampen consumer confidence and spending. Central banks have been cutting interest rates to spur inflation for years. But as rates approached zero across the developed world, a handful went a step further. Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and the 19 nations of the eurozone all took interest rates below zero. In Switzerland, negative interest rates have also helped to discourage investors from pouring money into the country during times of uncertainty. How will this affect savers? British savers have already seen their returns dwindle in recent years. The average UK instant access account pays just 0.45%, according to the Bank of England, while accounts that require you to lock your money away currently offer an average return of less than 1%. In countries with sub-zero interest rates, commercial banks have passed them on to big companies. However, the evidence suggests there is a very high bar to pass the pain on to ordinary savers. Christina Nyman, chief economist at Swedish lender Handelsbanken, says charging savers to put money in their own accounts is seen as ""taboo"" in Sweden. She says: ""Competition is fierce, and households are ready to move their money to another bank, so nobody wants to lose business."" Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse only impose negative rates on deposits of more than 2 million Swiss francs. In Germany, where some banks impose charges on deposits of more than €100,000 (£90,000), some people have started stashing their money in vaults. According to Germany's central bank, physical cash holdings by families and businesses there have almost trebled to €43.4bn since the European Central Bank (ECB) introduced a negative deposit rate in 2014. But David Oxley at Capital Economics says there hasn't been a wider shift towards cash because most people still prefer the security and convenience of keeping it in the bank. Putting it in a vault ""runs the risk of the money either being lost, stolen, or damaged,"" he says. ""Bank deposits cannot catch fire, but banknotes can."" What about borrowers? Negative rate mortgages already exist. Last year, Danish bank Jyske announced that it would effectively pay borrowers 0.5% a year to take out a 10-year loan. James Pomeroy, an economist at HSBC, says this was only possible because of the nature of the mortgage market. When someone in Denmark applies for a home loan, Danish banks act as a middleman between potential borrowers and investors. ""In Denmark the banks don't take the hit, investors do,"" says Mr Pomeroy. ""Banks are then charging higher product fees, so have actually made money off of this."" But negative rate mortgages are unlikely to be offered in the UK any time soon. When UK interest rates were slashed to 0.5% in March 2009, some borrowers thought they could be in line for a payment. Around 1,500 Cheltenham and Gloucester customers had a mortgage that tracked 1.01 percentage points below the Bank of England base rate. But any prospect of a windfall was quickly dashed when financial regulators described interest payments as ""a one-way obligation on the borrower"". What are the side effects of negative interest rates? Negative interest rates hit bank earnings by squeezing the gap between the money they make on loans and what they pay to savers. ""If not passed on to customers, negative rates would hurt bank profitability, especially at a time when they are expected to be hit by crisis-related loan losses,"" says Danae Kyriakopoulou, chief economist at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF). Negative interest rates pose a particular challenge to building societies, which hold around £1 of every £5 in British savings accounts. While commercial banks can access cheaper borrowing by tapping financial markets, building societies must raise at least half their funding from individual savers. The Bank of England is in the process of assessing the impact of negative rates on UK bank and building society profits, as well as how they affect insurers and pension funds. It is examining whether changing a scheme that rewards small business lending with access to cheap money, or shielding a share of the money high street lenders park at the central bank from negative rates, can help to offset the hit to profits. Ms Kyriakopoulou says more work needs to be done before negative rates can be deployed in the UK. ""One advantage in the UK, compared to say the euro area, is that we've seen strong coordination between the Treasury and the independent Bank of England in terms of their crisis response measures,"" she adds. ""Provided negative rates were also accompanied by continued support to the banking sector, this would help cushion the negative impact of the policy on the banking sector.""",Countries are being forced to use extreme measures to keep the economy afloat amid the coronavirus crisis.
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent It's a question that faces every developed economy where going to higher education has moved from an academic minority to a mainstream career pathway. In the United States, where student debts have spiralled through the trillion dollar barrier, the Obama administration has announced regulations designed to curb the risk of debt from courses that do not deliver any worthwhile career benefits. From July 2015, universities and colleges will be tested to see whether they deliver value to students' future earnings or else risk losing federal funding. It's meant to stop the toxic combination of high repayments and poor career prospects. ""Career colleges must be a stepping stone to the middle class. But too many hard-working students find themselves buried in debt with little to show for it. That is simply unacceptable,"" said US Education Secretary Arne Duncan. The education department says it wants to stop excessive costs for training that leads to low-wage jobs or unemployment. Balancing repayments The education department estimates that more than 800,000 current students are on courses that would fail this value-for-money test. And 99% of these students are taking courses run by for-profit colleges. The benchmark will be a ratio of debt repayments to earnings. Full details will be published later this week, but it will mean that typical graduates should not face debt repayments of more than 8% of total income or more than 20% of disposable income. If college debts are above these thresholds then they might be labelled as failing to prepare students for ""gainful employment"" and the college could lose access to federal funding. It's an attempt to unpick the thorny relationship between tuition fees, debt and student loans. But the measures have drawn criticism from both sides. The for-profit colleges have hammered the plans as being a barrier to poor students trying to improve their qualifications. 'Arbitrary and capricious' Steve Gunderson, president of the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, said it was a ""bad-faith attempt to cut off access to education for millions of students who have been historically under-served by higher education"". He attacked the debt-to-earnings ratio as ""arbitrary and capricious"" and launched a lobbying campaign to block the regulations. But there were other critics saying the regulations were too weak. Rory O'Sullivan, deputy director of the Young Invincibles lobby group, said the Obama administration had ""caved in"" to private providers. He said the thresholds should include the level of defaults on loans, including students who dropped out without graduating but still faced repayments. The United States Student Association also complained the rules left the funding system ""rigged"" against students. In many ways the US pioneered the modern university system, the first in the world to have mass participation in higher education. And now it is having to pioneer ways to cope with the levels of debt. Global challenge It is a challenge for all developed economies because student numbers are likely to carry on rising. The OECD economic think tank has consistently argued that the job markets in industrialised countries will require more graduates. There is a strong aspirational demand for higher education among young people - and the OECD suggests this is a well-founded ambition, because graduates continue to earn more than non-graduates. But it raises the question of who is going to pay for more university places? How much should individuals contribute? And if governments want to provide access for poorer students, how do they make sure the taxpayer is getting value for money? The university system in Germany has shifted in an entirely different direction this autumn - getting rid of all tuition fees. In England there are conflicting messages - with some calling for fees to rise, while others propose cutting fees. Scotland so far seems set to remain without tuition fees - and it remains uncertain how any change in England would affect fees in Wales and Northern Ireland. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says the US attempt to control student debts is part of a difficult balancing act. ""The challenge is to ensure that any changes designed to make institutions more accountable and to protect taxpayers do not also inhibit people from studying higher education courses with low private returns but high public returns - like nursing, for example."" In Australia, there have been protests about plans to remove limits on tuition fees. Student debt in the US has quadrupled in a decade - but there have been arguments that debt is not always bad news. US Deputy Treasury Secretary Sarah Bloom Raskin said increased student debt reflected more people going into higher education, which was a good investment for individuals and the economy. Universities were also charging more, she said, with tuition in US universities 50% more expensive in real terms than in 1994. University fees can be above $50,000 (£31,000) per year. Good student borrowing, she told students in Maryland earlier this term, was ""an engine for continued income mobility and economic growth"". The bad variety was illustrated by a graduate from a Florida law school with student debts of $200,000 (£125,000). ""I can't buy a car,"" said Kris Parker. ""I have a hard time buying furniture.""",Is going to university a way of getting on a ladder of opportunity? Or is it a way of descending into debt that will outweigh any promised advantages?
"A 16-year-old actress, sent by BBC Watchdog, was able to buy a kitchen knife that it is illegal to sell to someone under 18 in Tesco and Argos. Amazon broke its own delivery rules by handing over four knives ordered by the programme to the girl and leaving another one in a bin. The firms said they will investigate. In all, the teenager visited five different branches of Wilko, Asda, TK Maxx, Tesco and Argos. In Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, the teenage actress was sold a knife in three of the five stores that she visited, while one Argos store sold her a knife with no ID being checked. Four of the knives ordered from Amazon were delivered into her hands and one was left in a bin, rather than following the company's policy and refusing to hand them over to the teenager. No branches of Wilko, Asda and TK Maxx sold a knife to the 16-year-old. All of the retailers have signed up to a voluntary code in 2018, committing to check the ID of anyone they suspect of being under either 21 or 25 before selling or delivering a knife to them. Stephen Knight, from London Trading Standards, said of the Tesco sales: ""The fact that in three different stores we managed to get a purchase shows a more systematic issue about that particular organisation, not rolling out effective training procedures to staff."" He added that the knife sold in Argos was ""an unlawful sale to a young person"" and ""shouldn't have happened"". When presented with the findings, the companies promised to act: Knife crime in England and Wales rose to record levels last year, data shows. Police recorded 40,829 offences involving knives or sharp instruments in 2018, up 6% on the year before. The Office for National Statistics said cases of murder and manslaughter, excluding terror attacks, increased by 12%. There were 732 killings, up from 655 in 2017 - the highest since 2007. 'My heart and soul' On 3 July 2017, Alex Leonard was asleep at home when he was woken by someone outside kicking his car. Alex went to confront the individual, who pulled out a knife and stabbed him through the chest. His murderer was 16 years old. Alex's mum Debbie Leonard, who was on holiday at the time, told BBC Watchdog Live that her son was ""full of life, full of laughter and he was my heart and soul"". She said: ""I was so happy in my bubble, my little bubble of a life, and then my bubble got stabbed and it has burst open and now I am wandering lost, I feel so lost. ""This is happening so much, this escalation, because everyone is carrying a knife."" 'Easily obtainable' Duncan Ball, knife crime lead at the National Police Chiefs Council, said: ""For me, finding out that the young person has been able to purchase knives is very concerning. ""The figures that you mention are exactly in line from our own findings and broadly we find that about a fifth to a quarter of stores do supply to young people. ""Predominantly we see knives that are easily obtainable, so in the main it is indeed kitchen knives."" You can watch the full investigation on Wednesday 8 May at 20:00 BST on BBC One or on iPlayer afterwards.","Tesco and Argos have been breaking the law by selling knives to 16-year-olds without making proper ID checks, a BBC investigation has found."
"By Mariko OiBBC News, Japan His aim was to give children in rural areas an access to education. As a member of non-profit organisation e-Education Project, he travelled across the country for the next year. ""I filmed some of the best teachers' classes in big cities, burned them onto DVDs and showed them to students in rural areas,"" he says. He chose DVDs because internet connection was hard to come by. In the first year, Doga visited more than 700 students in five schools. The examination results at those schools improved by 46%. ""In developed countries, kids complain about having to do homework, but these Rwandan children were thrilled to be able to learn, which made me happy."" During one of his trips, he noticed piles of food that were in storage. Farmers were too poor to transport them to big cities. Through United Nations workers whom he met in Rwanda, Mr Makiura decided to facilitate the transport of food between the farmers and hundreds of thousands of refugees who were fleeing the civil war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. That was less than two years ago. Today, he is based in Bangkok where he has started his own company. His passion remains the same: to raise the living standards of people in developing countries. This time he's doing it through a mobile phone application called Personal Data Bank. The app is still in the early-development stage, but the aim is to build a more efficient infrastructure by analysing the locations of people who are using the app. Mr Makiura is an atypical Japanese youth. Above all, he is not afraid to take risks. And his global vision and entrepreneurial spirit are exactly what the Japanese government wants to encourage. Obstacles Today, Japan has one of the lowest levels of entrepreneurship in the developed world, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor. There are a number of obstacles. Japan has long lacked venture capitalists who tend to invest in start-ups elsewhere in the world. And approaching banks for financing help, is a big challenge for entrepreneurs. ""I asked for funding through traditional financial institutions but they wanted to see balance sheets which we don't have,"" says Naoki Mita, who left his banking job to open detox spa Le Furo. Mr Mita approached Mr Makiura and asked for him to be an adviser to the spa venture. And together, they managed to secure funding from investors abroad. But Mr Mita believes not many entrepreneurs would even consider raising money overseas. ""Thanks to my experience as an investment banker I could look outside Japan, but at home the gap between demand and supply in the capital market is severe,"" he says. But the fundamental problem lies deeper in people's perspectives. In a society that appreciates a conformist attitude, not following the usual path of becoming a salaryman - a company employee - is seen as too risky or even reckless. The former boss of the once high-flying internet firm, Livedoor, Takafumi Horie challenged that view in the 1990s. Instead of graduating from elite Tokyo University and looking for a job, he dropped out and started his own firm. 'Shock' ""I couldn't care less about what people thought of me,"" he tells the BBC. ""I had no desire to become a salaryman or wear a suit,"" adds Mr Horie, who stood out in the conservative world of corporate Japan by wearing T-shirts to business meetings. Under his leadership, Livedoor grew rapidly. He also made headlines by trying to buy a baseball team and running in a parliamentary election. But in 2006, Mr Horie was charged with securities fraud and imprisoned for 21 months before he was released on parole. He has maintained his innocence and accused the prosecution of targeting him for his brash, unconventional entrepreneurship. His arrest became known as the ""Horie shock"" and regardless of their beliefs about his guilt, other entrepreneurs from then on kept a low profile. The support for start-ups that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has announced is a turning point in people's perspectives. Spirit 'lacking' Today, there are more venture capital companies to help start-ups. The number of entrepreneurs is on the rise. ""What's lacking now is the true venture capitalist spirit - not just injecting capital but mentoring and helping the next generation grow,"" says special advisor to the Cabinet Office William Saito, adding that the government is trying to encourage that. But Mr Makiura says many of his peers are still trying to get a job with big listed companies. He says he is who he is today because when he was just 13, he decided to leave the comfort of home to study in the UK. He wanted to see the world outside Japan. Mr Horie says the whole education system needs to change, because at the moment, it is only producing loyal soldiers who are good at following orders. Half a century ago, Japan did produce a number of great entrepreneurs. They were the founders of Toyota, Sony and Honda who were unafraid to try something different. But as the economy grew, Mr Saito says, the Japanese society became unforgiving towards failures, and this needs to change. People like Mr Makiura are still too rare. But Japanese youths who are unafraid to take risks may be the best way to jump start the Japanese economy.","In September 2012, 18-year-old Doga Makiura made his first trip to Rwanda, a country which many Japanese would only associate with the genocide in 1994."
"At a parliamentary hearing, members of the Commons Transport Committee said the carmaker had treated some customers like ""second-class citizens"". They also said there had been inconsistencies in GM's investigations of the fires. The firm apologised and said it was working to compensate owners. More than 234,000 Vauxhall Zafira B cars were recalled for a second time last year over a technical problem that had caused some models to burst into flames. Vauxhall initially said the blazes were caused by improper repairs to the heating and ventilation system but later found a fuse design was also at fault. Evira Toelkes, vice-president of quality at GM Europe, told MPs the firm had written 1.2 million letters to owners seeking a recall and managed to fix 165,000 cars. She also said that extra technicians had been deployed to speed up the repairs. Multiple complaints However, SNP politician Stewart Malcolm McDonald said customers had made numerous complaints about the firm's handling of the process, with some forming a group to lobby Parliament. ""Some customers were made to feel like a nuisance or were met with disgust at dealerships,"" he said. ""Vehicles were often returned to them with further problems with the heating and ventilation system."" He added: ""I can't think of another product in the United Kingdom at the moment where people have set up a campaign group and come to Parliament to try and resolve it."" Helen Foord, head of government relations at GM, said the firm's dealers had since been issued with guidance on how to handle the complaints better. ""Our dealers were trying to make the recall process as smooth and easy for customers as possible, but we understand that might not be the case the whole time and we apologise for the additional inconvenience,"" she said. The executives were also criticised for having launched 59 investigations into the damaged vehicles, despite knowing of 287 reported fires. Thomas Berenz - director of global safety and field investigations at GM - said GM had not been able to access all of the vehicles. This was because customers had not always given permission to investigate, while some vehicles may have been scrapped, he said.

"The prosecutors are investigating allegations that Samsung gave money to the daughter of Choi Soon-sil, a close friend of the president. Ms Choi is accused of using their friendship to interfere in politics and solicit business donations. Samsung confirmed the raids to the BBC saying they had ""no further comment"". President Park has apologised for her ties to Ms Choi but faces mounting calls to resign. In this latest twist of the scandal that's been rocking South Korea for weeks, prosecutors are investigating allegations that Samsung might have provided €2.8m euros ($3.1m, £2.5m) to a company co-owned by Ms Choi and her daughter, to bankroll the daughter's equestrian training in Germany. Prosecutors are also reported to have raided the offices of the Korea Equestrian Federation and the Korea Horse Affairs Association. Ms Choi was arrested on 3 November and charged with fraud and abuse of power. Over the past days, tens of thousands of South Koreans have protested in the capital, Seoul, to demand the resignation of President Park over the corruption row. Ms Choi, a long-time friend of Ms Park's, is the daughter of Choi Tae-min, a shadowy quasi-religious leader who was closely linked to Ms Park's father, then-president Park Chung-hee. She is alleged to have pushed businesses to donate millions of dollars to foundations she controlled, helped choose presidential aides, and even picked the president's clothes. Ms Park has since apologised on TV for allowing her long-standing friend inappropriate access to government policy-making. The president admitted she had let Ms Choi edit her speeches. President Park has already replaced her prime minster, reshuffled her cabinet and dismissed several aides, but there are growing calls for her resignation or impeachment. The scandal has left Ms Park with an approval rating of just 5%. Choo Mi-ae, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, said she did not believe the apology was genuine and called on her to accept a new prime minister recommended by parliament. Ms Park became her country's first female president when she was elected in a close-run contest in December 2012.",South Korean prosecutors have raided the offices of Samsung Electronics as part of a probe into the political scandal around President Park Geun-hye.
"The company warned investors last week that it would report a loss of up to a billion dollars, due to poor sales of its new smartphones. It also announced 4,500 job cuts in a bid to stem those losses. Earlier this week Blackberry agreed to be bought by a consortium led by Fairfax Financial, its biggest shareholder, for $4.7bn (£3bn). Blackberry said it would continue to explore other options while negotiations with Fairfax continued. The company's financial problems came to a head this year following disappointing sales of its new Z10 smartphone. Sales were so poor that Blackberry had to write off $934m in the second quarter to account for the weakness. Disappointment Released in January - after many delays - the phone has failed to enthuse consumers. The firm reported total sales of $1.6bn compared with $3.1bn in the same quarter of 2012, a near 50% fall. ""We are very disappointed with our operational and financial results this quarter and have announced a series of major changes to address the competitive hardware environment and our cost structure,"" said Thorsten Heins, Blackberry's chief executive. In the second quarter, Blackberry said it sold 3.7 million Blackberry smartphones. That compares with 7.4 million shipments in the same period of 2012. To put that into perspective, Apple sold nine million of its new iPhone 5S and 5C models on the opening weekend of sales. Decay In a research note, Colin Gillis from the brokers BGC, said the results were ""startling weak"". He said the company's plan to focus on corporate customer, might fail. ""While we applaud the decision to focus on retooling the company into a niche enterprise focused business, it seems years too late. ""Just as the consumer business has crumbled, the enterprise business is also in decay in our opinion. ""Given the negative news flow from the company, enterprise customers are likely to shy away from committing to a struggling platform,"" Mr Gillis said.",Blackberry has reported a second quarter net loss of $965m (£600m) following a slump in sales.
"Royal Mail has offered 125,000 workers the three-year pay rise, as well as bonuses and other changes to conditions. But the Communication Workers Union (CWU) described the offer as ""misleading and unacceptable"". The government is planning to sell the operator to the private sector. Business Secretary Vince Cable has spoken of a possible share sale before the end of the year. In its latest offer, Royal Mail said any pay deal made now ""would not be affected by any change in ownership of the company"". 'Sweetener' It also said that it would ensure a minimum of 10% of shares would be set aside for employees ahead of any sale, and called for a ""new model"" of working with the CWU - the main union body. ""We have already built a stronger Royal Mail together, through closer cooperation and trust in recent years,"" said Moya Green, Royal Mail chief executive. ""We are now offering a new long-term agreement with the CWU and our employees. ""This is a good deal - good for Royal Mail and good for our people. We are asking the CWU and our people to accept this new agreement. But Dave Ward, CWU deputy general secretary, said the pay-rise on offer was merely ""a sweetener"". ""Postal workers want more security; what's on offer is less. With privatisation looming, the protections Royal Mail have put on offer are not worth the paper they're written on,"" he said. ""The pay rise is only there as a sweetener to swallow some very bitter pills on damaging changes to pensions, and a raft of workplace uncertainty. ""The deal that they've spun in their press release is not the real deal. Postal workers will know that."" He warned that industrial conflict was ""inevitable"" if the union did not receive assurances it wanted. The Royal Mail proposal also states that an ""industrial Stability mechanism will be developed as part of the agreement"". This is thought to amount to a no strike deal. A CWU spokesperson said the union would never sign up to an agreement that took away the right of its members to undertake legitimate industrial action.","The union that represents postal workers has rejected a proposed 8.6% pay increase from Royal Mail, amid privatisation plans."
"The deal will see Microsoft pay $8.5bn (£5.2bn) for Skype, making it Microsoft's largest acquisition. Luxembourg-based Skype has 663 million global users. In August last year it announced plans for a share flotation, but this was subsequently put on hold. Internet auction house eBay bought Skype for $2.6bn in 2006, before selling 70% of it in 2009 for $2bn. This majority stake was bought by a group of investors led by private equity firms Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowit. Other major shareholders include tech-firm Joltid and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. Shares in Microsoft ended the day in New York down 0.5% at $25.68. In contrast, eBay - which owns a stake in Skype - saw its share price rally 2.5%. 'Defensive move' Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer said: ""Skype is a phenomenal service that is loved by millions of people around the world. ""Together we will create the future of real-time communications so people can easily stay connected to family, friends, clients and colleagues anywhere in the world."" Skype will now become a new division within Microsoft, and Skype chief executive Tony Bates will continue to lead the business, reporting directly to Mr Ballmer. ""It's a strategic asset and a defensive move [for Microsoft],"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. ""If they can put it on Windows 8, it gives them an advantage. It helps them in the tablet market."" Other analysts say Microsoft's aim in buying Skype is to improve its video conferencing services. Price concerns Although the price tag of $8.5bn will not stretch the US giant, some experts have questioned whether it is paying too much for a company that has struggled to turn a profit. Michael Clendenin, managing director of consulting firm RedTech Advisors, said: ""If you consider [Skype] was just valued at about $2.5bn 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5bn seems generous. ""[It] means Microsoft has a high wall to climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin for the company's online and mobile strategy."" This view was echoed by Ben Woods, head of research group CCS Insight. ""The big unanswered question is how do Skype assets work for Microsoft... how do you justify the price?"" he said. Skype was founded in 2003. Calls to other Skype users are free, while the company charges for those made to both traditional landline phones and mobiles.",Microsoft has confirmed that it has agreed to buy internet phone service Skype.
"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter But the study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies warns that any gains would be small and were based on ""optimistic"" assumptions. It also said that consumers had already seen prices rise by 2% since the referendum due to the weaker pound. Costs linked to new EU trade barriers could also hit consumers, it said. Those increased costs would ""offset"" any ""rather limited"" gains from becoming tariff free in the future, the report from the think tank says. ""We estimate that complete abolition of all tariffs would reduce prices faced by households by about 0.7-1.2%,"" the report says. ""This could have additional positive economic benefits in the long run but could also be very damaging for some UK industries in the short run."" Abandoning tariffs Tariffs - taxes on imports - are often used to protect parts of a country's economy such as farming and car manufacturing. Abandoning tariffs would mean greater competition for those sectors from abroad which could mean job losses, for example. Following that period, many economists argue that increased competition generally lowers prices for consumers. The IFS suggests some of the short-term economic damage could be alleviated by only reducing tariffs on products Britain does not produce in very high quantities but at present do face high tariffs on entering the EU's customs union, such as olives and oranges. ""This would result in much smaller gains, reducing the total cost of the basket of goods purchased by the typical household by less than 0.4%,"" the IFS said. ""This compares with the estimated 2% increase in prices that followed the depreciation in sterling in the wake of the referendum result. ""This suggests that the scale of 'quick wins' from running an independent trade policy is relatively small."" 'Small effect' The report says that average tariffs applied to UK imports as part of the EU's customs union are around 2.8%. It also says that of every £100 spent by UK households, only £26 is affected, directly or indirectly, by the import prices of goods on which tariffs are charged. Paul Johnson, the director of the IFS, told the BBC: ""If we leave the customs union, we can come to our own trade deals with other countries, we can reduce tariffs. ""But even if we reduce that as much as possible, the effect on prices will be really quite small relative to what is still a big cost of leaving the customs union because it would make trade with the rest of Europe so much more expensive.""","Consumers could see prices fall by up to 1.2% if Britain were to abolish all tariffs once it has left the European Union, a report says."
"By Joshua HaighBusiness reporter Nearly 180,000 retail jobs were lost in the UK in 2020, up by almost a quarter on the previous year, according to the Centre for Retail Research (CRR). It warned there will be more pain for the sector in 2021 as retailers face a cash flow crisis and rent payments. It has predicted up to 200,000 more retail jobs will be at risk in 2021. Professor Joshua Bamfield, a director at the Centre for Retail Research, said its forecast was based on ""the cumulative effects of months of closure and its impact upon cash flow and rent arrears that will be payable when the moratorium ends. ""Whilst the longer-term effects of the greater use by shoppers of all kinds of online retailing is likely to be hugely damaging for physical stores,"" he added. Major brands including Topshop-owner Arcadia, Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group and Debenhams slashed hundreds of jobs after collapsinig into administration during the year. Susannah Streeter, market analyst at Hargreaves Landsdown, said the pandemic alone couldn't ""be blamed for the collapse of household names. It merely accelerated the shift to digital,"" she said. She says that 2021 will be a ""year of painful evolution"" for the sector. ""Debenhams has been the key anchor store in city centres for decades, but fell behind fashion trends, whilst locked into long leases with rising rents with underperforming online sales. ""Topshop was still the leader of the High Street fashion pack a decade ago, but underinvestment in e-commerce and social media, saw it leapfrogged by savvy online rivals like Boohoo and Asos."" The success of fast fashion online retailers such as Boohoo has been tough for some of the more established High Street brands to emulate. Mrs Streeter said that shoppers appeared to ""shrug off"" accusations that the retailer had been ""tolerating widespread abuses of employment law"" at some of its suppliers in Leicester. ""Although ethical concerns do appear to be growing amongst some consumers, it seems fast fashion shoppers are still prioritising price."" The pandemic has 'turbo-charged' the High Street's decline Analysis by consumer affairs correspondent Sarah Corker The High Street was struggling before the pandemic struck, but almost a year of lockdowns and restrictions appears to have turbocharged that decline. Some estimate the shift towards online shopping has been accelerated by five to ten years. Every week in 2020, an estimated 3,400 retail jobs were lost. Retailers have spent huge sums of money making their premises covid secure; stores have been re-designed with one way systems and plastic screens, returned items are quarantined for up to 72 hours and there are enhanced cleaning regimes. All that pushes costs up at a time when social distancing means there are fewer customers. But amid the slew of store closures, there is a sliver of positive news. As more of us work from home, we're spending more money locally and rediscovering our local high streets and independent stores. Analysis of spending habits suggests smaller neighbourhood shopping areas have fared much better than large cities and shopping centres this year. Currently around three million people in the UK work in retail. The CRR warned that on-going Tier 4 restrictions and a delayed rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the UK could spark up to 200,000 job losses. 'Not a bun fight' Mrs Streeter added that it would be crucial for high street retailers to evolve their in-store experience if they were to attract customers back in a post Covid-19 climate. ""Department stores can still thrive, if they provide the experience the customer craves. Items like footwear can be very difficult to get right online,"" she said. Trying out fragrances and skincare is impossible in a virtual world. Underwear, which is difficult to return, may look a good fit on models but customers prefer to try it before they buy, she says. ""However, shopping needs to be an enjoyable pasttime, not a bun fight amid vast racks of clothes. Reducing retail footprints, while investing in the appeal of an exciting in store and online seamless experience will be key to attracting newer younger customers.""","Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the coronavirus accelerated the move towards online shopping, analysts say."

"Analysis by Jorn MadslienBusiness reporter, BBC News A full year figure for 2012 has yet to be released, but during the January to November period, just 11.7 million cars were sold, 7.2% fewer than during the same period in 2011, according to European carmakers' organisation ACEA. Sales, which are already more than a fifth lower than they were during their peak of about 15.5 million in 2007, are expected to continue to fall some 3% this year, according to ratings agency Fitch and others. What's more, carmakers in Europe produced some four million cars last year that they have yet to sell - a backlog that would take about three months or more to clear at current sales rates. It is clear, then, that carmakers are having to adjust to what they fear could be a long-lasting slump. Many of them have already made plans to cut jobs and output to match demand. ""Vehicle sales will not recover to pre-crisis levels in the near to mid-future, so the industry needs to adjust for the overcapacity that exists,"" ACEA head Ivan Hodac said in November. Carmakers have urged the European Union to ""use all the means at its disposal"" to support regions where jobs are lost, in order to reduce the social and economic impact of their cutbacks. Commercially viable Carmakers insist that what they are doing is necessary to remain commercially viable, let alone competitive, in the years ahead. Many industry observers agree, pointing to Europe's many ageing and hopelessly uncompetitive car factories that are facing increasingly stiff competition from more modern manufacturing plants elsewhere in the world. Old factories' costs are excessive, industry analysts and executives say, not least as carmakers in Europe are utilising no more than an estimated 70% of their current production capacity - with some carmakers using as little as 50-60% of their capacity, according to ACEA. This makes the factories unable to compete on price in global markets, which in turn makes it almost impossible to utilise the capacity to build cars for exports outside Europe. Consequently, many of Europe's carmakers - Fiat, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Opel/Vauxhall in particular - depend almost totally on fast-shrinking European markets, where the excess capacity is fuelling a crippling price war between manufacturers that are expected to suffer losses to the tune of several hundred million euros each this year. Troubled European carmakers resent finding themselves in this situation. Many in the industry feel that the current crisis could have been avoided, or that at least its impact could have been reduced, had they taken the opportunity to close factories and cut capacity during the 2008-9 downturn, rather than accept short-term government support, such as scrappage schemes, that tided them over. They realise that the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in Europe is painful for their workers, but they also insist that they have no choice but to pay that price to safeguard the long-term future of the European car industry.","European carmakers are expected to continue to cut jobs in response to terrible market conditions in Europe, where sales have been falling fast to levels not seen in two decades."
"Tickets on trips from Hong Kong to Portugal were sold on the airline's website for $1,512, instead of $16,000 usually charged for a similar journey. The carrier said it would honour the tickets as it investigates the cause of the error. It extends a recent run of blows to the firm including a huge data breach. The mispriced fares were available on Cathay Pacific's website on Sunday. First-class flights from Lisbon to Hong Kong - via London with a connecting flight - were offered for $1,512 (£1,177), according to the South China Morning Post. A similar first-class journey through Frankfurt would cost $16,000. In a statement, the Hong Kong carrier said it would honour the tickets. ""We are looking into the root cause of this incident both internally and externally with our vendors,"" it said. ""For the very small number of customers who have purchased these tickets, we look forward to welcoming you on board to enjoy our premium services."" Just two weeks ago the airline made the same blunder. Lucky flyers made off with business-class seats on flights from Vietnam to New York for about $675 return. They should have cost $16,000. At the time, the carrier acknowledged its ""mistake"" and again, said it would welcome the passengers onboard. Airlines have a mixed history of honouring tickets sold in error. Singapore Airlines, for example, honoured tickets sold for less than half price in 2014. But United Airlines cancelled transatlantic tickets sold for less than $100 by a ""third party software provider"" the following year. A challenging year The latest stumble extends a bad run for Cathay Pacific. In October, the firm was the subject of a data breach in its IT systems, jeopardising the personal information of up to 9.4 million passengers. A month earlier, it had to send one of its planes back to the paint shop after spelling the airline's name ""Cathay Paciic"" on the side of a jet. Those missteps come as the airline tries to return to profitability after posting its first ever back-to-back annual loss in March. Cathay Pacific has struggled against competition, particularly from low-cost Chinese carriers covering Hong Kong, mainland China and South East Asia.","A group of lucky Cathay Pacific customers have scored first-class seats at economy prices, in the second fare blunder by the airline this month."

"Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks. ""Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,"" Mr Haldane said. ""This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago."" 'Agony and ecstasy' Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US. Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year. Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as ""writhing in both agony and ecstasy"". He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said. However, he said the ""reasons to be fearful"" included productivity and wages, which had not risen. ""If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,"" said Mr Haldane. Sterling dropped 0.5% against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile. 'Stormy waters' Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was ""more unstable than it has been for some time"". Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were ""a lot of global risks out there at the moment"" affecting the international economy. ""Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,"" Mr Osborne said. He added: ""I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border. ""The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won."" He said it was important to ""make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters"". Earlier this month, Mr Osborne warned that the eurozone slowdown will impact UK economy.","Interest rates should remain low to avoid long-term economic stagnation, the chief economist at the Bank of England has said."
"Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 158,000. In July, the economy had created 159,000 new jobs. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%, while average hourly earnings growth rose 3.2% from last year. The US economy is feeling the strain of President Donald Trump's tariff war with China and a wider global slowdown. Mr Trump has been talking up the US economy in recent weeks amid growing unease about a potential recession. Last month's job figures were boosted by government hiring of 25,000 workers for the upcoming US Census. Hiring in health care and professional and business services was also up. However, the Labor Department said employers added 20,000 fewer jobs in July and June than it previously estimated. And while pay and participation in the workforce increased, both remain lower than rates typical before the financial crisis of 2008. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates at its meeting this month in an attempt to keep the economy growing. In July, the central bank cut rates for the first time since 2008. However, that was not enough to satisfy Mr Trump, who has repeatedly called for a ""substantial"" rate cut. In his latest tweets on the economy, Mr Trump denied that there were troubles brewing. ""The Economy is great. The only thing adding to 'uncertainty' is the fake news,"" he wrote. He also called into question the competence of Fed chair Jerome Powell, saying: ""Where did I find this guy Jerome?"" Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics said the Labor Department's report offered enough good news to make a dramatic cut by the Fed unlikely. He pointed to the growth in wages and labour force participation. For now, hiring remains strong enough to keep pace with growth in the labour force. But economist Gus Faucher of PNC Bank predicted that jobs growth would slow further, given a slump in global growth and uncertainty over trade. ""Although job growth will slow, the US economy should avoid recession,"" he said.","The US economy added 130,000 jobs last month, slowing more than expected, the latest official figures have shown."
"JP Morgan bought the investment bank Bear Stearns in March 2008. It said that it would contest the allegations. This is the first action to come out of a working group created by US President Barack Obama looking into the causes of the 2008 financial crash. JP Morgan said: ""The NYAG civil action relates to Bear Stearns, which we acquired over the course of a weekend at the behest of the US government. This complaint is entirely about historic conduct by that entity."" Crisis spark US mortgage-backed securities were the investment products that sparked the global financial crisis in 2008. In essence, each security or bond was linked to pools of US mortgage loans, many of which were classified as sub-prime - mortgages awarded to high-risk and low-wage homeowers. When many of those homebuyers defaulted on their mortgages as the US property bubble burst, it turned the linked securities into bad debt. This caused billion-dollar losses at banks, who were forced to write down the value of their investments. Banks around the world were affected, not just those in the US, because the securities were resold globally. The securities had been widely purchased because rating agencies had mistakenly given them the highest possible credit rating. As banks realised they were sitting on huge liabilities, they halted lending to each other, freezing up the global financial system in the process and making it harder for businesses and individuals to borrow funds. 'Ignored deficit' The civil suit, filed by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, accuses Bear Stearns of failing to ensure the quality of loans underlying residential mortgage-backed securities. It relates to securities sold by Bear Stearns in 2006 and 2007 - before it was taken over by JP Morgan. The legal action claims the bank ""systematically failed to fully evaluate the loans, largely ignored the defects that their limited review did uncover, and kept investors in the dark about both the inadequacy of their review procedures and the defects in the underlying loans"". It says that this led to the inclusion of mortgages on which borrowers were likely to default, and that investor losses in 2006 and 2007 totalled more than a quarter of the original £87bn value of the securities. The NYAG wants the company to pay an undisclosed amount of damages for investor losses ""caused, directly or indirectly, by the fraudulent and deceptive acts"". The BBC's business editor Robert Peston said there were some ""jaw-dropping elements"" exposed in the suit. He said it disclosed ""a manic and frenzied culture of procuring and packaging as many mortgages as humanly possible, to maintain the bonds spewing from the investment bank, to generate as much short-term profit as humanly possible"". ""All this is a bit like the fifth instalment in a series of horror films, with each succeeding production gorier than the preceding one,"" adds our editor. A JPMorgan spokesman accused the NYAG of not giving the bank a sufficient chance to discuss the accusations before launching the legal action. He said: ""We're disappointed that the NYAG decided to pursue its civil action without ever offering us an opportunity to rebut the claims and without developing a full record - instead relying on recycled claims already made by private plaintiffs. ""We will nonetheless continue to work with members of the president's RMBS Working Group and are fully co-operating with their inquiries.""",The New York Attorney General has sued JP Morgan Chase for allegedly defrauding investors who lost more than $20bn (£12bn) on mortgage-backed securities sold by Bear Stearns.
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Some 512 million alerts were sent last year telling people their salary had been paid in or that they were heading into an overdraft, a report shows. The report, by banking trade body UK Finance, reveals our increasing reliance on technology to budget. It comes as TSB continues to face difficulties with digital services. The migration of data on TSB's five million customers from former owner Lloyds' IT system to a new one managed by current Spanish owner Sabadell a month ago caused major problems for customers. Adrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, said that the level of upset created by the TSB saga had shown how much consumers now relied on digital services. ""It is up to the industry to ensure that these problems do not happen again,"" he said. ""It is not just TSB looking at that but all banks across the whole industry."" Apps on the rise The Way We Bank Now report by UK Finance revealed that there were about 5.5 billion log-ins to banking apps last year, a 13% rise on the previous year. Mobile banking is most popular among millennials, with almost 59% of 16 to 24-year-olds and 69% of 25 to 34-year-olds using their smartphones. In contrast, almost half (49%) of 65-year-olds bank online. The figures come a day after industry analyst CACI predicted that more consumers would use apps on their smartphones rather than a computer to do their banking by as early as next year. Initially, apps only allowed people to check their balance and see recent transactions, but now they are used regularly for more complex tasks such as setting up standing orders, transferring money to friends, or other money management functions. Technology is also changing the way bank statements are being produced. Some already provide forward-looking statements that give a clear indication of when regular or pending payments will come out of an account and affect the customer's balance. Regulators have aimed for more competition in the sector through the system of Open Banking, which allows customers access to specific new services through their old account. One huge change on the horizon is the planned introduction of a streamlined payments system - currently called New Payments Architecture. It is designed to be operational by 2021, although it will run in parallel to the current system for a few years. In time, it should offer real-time balances and 24/7 payments, meaning - in theory - salaries could be paid on the same day each month even if this falls on a weekend. It could also mean no ""pending transactions"" on a bank balance. Customers would be able to confirm the identity of a payee - rather than simply rely on getting the correct account number and sort-code, and invoices and other information could be attached to payments, helping business with their reconciliation of payments. It could also offer the opportunity for those struggling to pay bills to do so in instalments, without the need for long agreements and paperwork. Security remained ""paramount"", Mr Buckle said, but the TSB debacle has clearly proved that what bank customers want above all else with new technology is for it to work properly.",Banks now send more than 16 text alerts every second in an indication of how much we now rely on smartphones rather than computers to manage our money.
"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter Well, they're all on a list of about 1,300 Chinese products the US is considering slapping a 25% tariff on. The juice press might not cause too much of a squeeze for Beijing. But many of the goods on that list are in industries like aerospace and engineering - areas of innovation that China wants to become a world leader over the next decade. And the planned 25% tariffs do have the potential to hurt China. The US bought close to $75bn (£53.2bn) of China's machinery and computers in 2017. And that's expected to be almost $80bn in 2018 and 2019. These goods make up by far the biggest chunk of Chinese imports to the US. And they're on the list. ""The new US tariffs have really taken it up a notch,"" says Tony Nash of research house Complete Intelligence. ""The key issue is that it targets many of the value added goods being traded by China."" What's the US afraid of? A quick history lesson. Let's go back to the late 1980s, when China was still opening up to the world under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping. What happened next is the stuff dreams are made of, as the Petersen Institute of International Economics points out: A lot of this growth came from the manufacturing boom of the 70s and 80s. But the US says that China forced American companies who wanted access to low-cost labour in the country to tie up with Chinese companies - effectively allowing them to copy and steal American ideas. ""China is very aggressive about what it wants,"" Martin Medeiros of Medeiros Law told me from the US. ""It has come a long way since the 1980s but the Chinese don't think about intellectual property the way Americans do."" At the heart of this battle is that the US feels unfairly played, and that it is American technology which has given China an unfair advantage in the global innovation game. But the reality is that China is racing ahead, and it doesn't need the US's permission. In its 13th Five Year Plan published in 2016, China announced its vision to become an ""innovation nation"" by 2020, an ""international innovation leader"" by 2030, and ""a world powerhouse of scientific and technological innovation by 2050"". China is spending more money on research and development, and filing thousands of patents. Its companies are some of the world's leaders in innovation, artificial intelligence and are engaged in cutting edge research. The US is worried that Chinese companies will take over America's influence in these areas. So does China need to worry? China has to care about what the US does in terms of tariffs, believes Deborah Elms from the Asian Trade Centre. These are going to hit real people and some companies will likely go bankrupt if tariffs of 25% are actually applied and if counter-retaliation happens, she says In China there is no social safety net to catch folks who lose jobs. And in a country where the political system is predicated on the assumption that the government will look after its people, job losses aren't good for the Communist Party. Will US tariffs push China to change? In the short term - no, says Mr Medeiros. The tariffs will ""potentially hurt China simply by lack of market access,"" but won't do much to change China's IP laws which he acknowledges have improved considerably over the years. In the long term though, perhaps it will push Beijing to give up some ground - including the requirements for foreign firms to do joint ventures and technology transfers. Don't hold your breath though. With current rhetoric ratcheting up, and a tit-for-tat attitude on both sides, this is more than just a trade war. It's about two superpowers fighting for dominance in an increasingly polarised world. And no one wants to lose face.","What do bakery ovens, high definition colour television sets, juice presses, rocket launchers and uranium have in common?"
"Regulators grounded the plane in March 2019 following two separate deadly crashes within five months. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) lifted the ban last month after Boeing agreed to new safeguards. American Airlines' flight on Tuesday showed its confidence in the safety of the 737 MAX. ""This is an aircraft that has been more highly scrutinised than any ever before. We're very confident that this aircraft is the safest in the skies,"" the airline's president Robert Isom said before the flight's departure. American Airlines currently has 31 737 MAX aircraft, including seven which were delivered after the FAA lifted its safety ban in November. The airline and aerospace giant Boeing have both sought to reassure the public over the plane’s safety, although polls suggest that might be difficult. A Reuters/IPSOS poll shows that more than half of passengers are wary of taking the jet when reminded of two fatal crashes that led to the grounding. Troubled history Regulators initially pulled the plane from service after two catastrophic crashes killed 346 people. Lion Air Flight 610 crashed after take-off from Jakarta in October 2018, while Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa airport in March 2019. Before the 737 Max was cleared to fly again, Boeing updated flight control software, revised crew procedures and rerouted internal wiring. Although the FAA has already lifted its ban, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency isn't expected to clear the plane to fly until January. American Airlines is the third carrier globally to resume flights following Brazilian low-cost carrier Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes and Grupo Aeromexico earlier this month. A smooth return to service could be vital for Boeing, which announced its fourth straight quarterly loss in October, along with deeper job cuts. The 737 MAX issue saw annual orders drop to their lowest level in two decades. Boeing’s problems have also been compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has affected both airlines and manufacturers. The International Air Transport Association predicts global passenger traffic will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024",Boeing’s 737 MAX has resumed passenger flights in the US with an American Airlines flight between Miami and New York.
"The retailer is offering miniature replicas of its most popular food items in a promotion called Little Shop. There are 25 of the toys and shoppers get one free for every £20 spent. But some shoppers have taken to social media to denounce M&S for producing needless plastic waste, while others have complained about the high cost. Each toy comes in a wrapper, making it impossible to see which one it is until it is opened. Even if it were possible to be sure of getting a different one every time, it would still be necessary to spend a minimum of £500 to get a complete set. The store chain's head of sustainability, Carmel McQuaid, has appeared in a YouTube video in an effort to reassure customers that the promotion will not harm the environment. She said that sustainability was ""at the heart"" of the Little Shop collectables and that M&S would recycle any unwanted toys. 'Public tide' But one customer commented: ""Major fail M&S who clearly are not listening to the public tide of anti-single use plastic."" The campaign has also been criticised on other social media platforms, including Facebook and Mumsnet. One visitor to the M&S Facebook page said: ""M&S, you've completely missed the point. Yes, recycling is very important, but it's about stopping making the pointless plastic rubbish in the first place."" An M&S spokesperson told the BBC the toys were ""designed to be used again and again"", but there were collection boxes in every store for those who wanted to return them for recycling. The retailer is also running swap events where people can exchange duplicates and obtain the toys they have missed. The spokesperson said the promotion was part of M&S's strategy to be ""more relevant to the family customer"". As for the high cost of collecting all the items, the spokesperson said M&S was planning additional promotions allowing shoppers to get more toys for a lower cost.",Marks & Spencer says a controversial giveaway plastic toy campaign will continue despite protests from environment-conscious customers.
"By Tim Harford50 Things That Made the Modern Economy, BBC World Service It was, of course, the iPhone. There are many ways in which the iPhone has defined the modern economy. There is the sheer profitability of the thing, of course: there are only two or three companies in the world that make as much money as Apple does from the iPhone alone. Apple may not have sold the first smartphone, but the iPhone represented a quantum leap compared with earlier models, and its version became an object of desire for most of humanity. There's the way the iPhone transformed other markets - software, music, and advertising. But those are just the obvious facts about the iPhone. And when you delve more deeply, the tale is a surprising one. We give credit to Steve Jobs and other leading figures in Apple - his early partner Steve Wozniak, his successor Tim Cook, his visionary designer Sir Jony Ive - but some of the most important actors in this story have been forgotten. Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen online or subscribe to the programme podcast. Ask yourself: what actually makes an iPhone an iPhone? It's partly the cool design, the user interface, the attention to detail in the way the software works and the hardware feels. But underneath the charming surface of the iPhone are some critical elements that made it, and all the other smartphones, possible. The economist Mariana Mazzucato has made a list of 12 key technologies that make smartphones work: 1) tiny microprocessors, 2) memory chips, 3) solid state hard drives, 4) liquid crystal displays and 5) lithium-based batteries. That's the hardware. Then there are the networks and the software. So 6) Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithms - clever bits of maths that make it possible to swiftly turn analogue signals such as sound, visible light and radio waves into digital signals that a computer can handle. At 7) - and you might have heard of this one - the internet. A smartphone isn't a smartphone without the internet. At 8) HTTP and HTML, the languages and protocols that turned the hard-to-use internet into the easy-to-access World Wide Web. 9) Cellular networks. Otherwise your smartphone not only isn't smart, it's not even a phone. 10) Global Positioning Systems or GPS. 11) The touchscreen. 12) Siri, the voice-activated artificial intelligence agent. All of these technologies are important components of what makes an iPhone, or any smartphone, actually work. Some of them are not just important, but indispensable. But when Mariana Mazzucato assembled this list of technologies, and reviewed their history, she found something striking. The foundational figure in the development of the iPhone wasn't Steve Jobs. It was Uncle Sam. Every single one of these 12 key technologies was supported in significant ways by governments - often the American government. A few of these cases are famous. Many people know, for example, that the World Wide Web owes its existence to the work of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was a software engineer employed at Cern, the particle physics research centre in Geneva that is funded by governments across Europe. And the internet itself started as Arpanet - an unprecedented network of computers funded by the US Department of Defense in the early 1960s. GPS, of course, was a pure military technology, developed during the Cold War and opened up to civilian use only in the 1980s. Other examples are less famous, though scarcely less important. The Fast-Fourier-Transform is a family of algorithms that have made it possible to move from a world where the telephone, the television and the gramophone worked on analogue signals, to a world where everything is digitised and can therefore be dealt with by computers such as the iPhone. The most common such algorithm was developed from a flash of insight from the great American mathematician John Tukey. What was Tukey working on at the time? You've guessed it: a military application. Specifically, he was on President Kennedy's Scientific Advisory committee in 1963, trying to figure out how to detect when the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons. Smartphones wouldn't be smartphones without their touchscreens - but the inventor of the touchscreen was an engineer named EA Johnson, whose initial research was carried out while Johnson was employed by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, a stuffily-named agency of the British government. The work was further developed at Cern - those guys again. Eventually multi-touch technology was commercialised by researchers at the University of Delaware in the United States - Wayne Westerman and John Elias, who sold their company to Apple itself. Yet even at that late stage in the game, governments played their part: Wayne Westerman's research fellowship was funded by the US National Science Foundation and the CIA. Then there's the girl with the silicon voice, Siri. Back in the year 2000, seven years before the first iPhone, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, Darpa, commissioned the Stanford Research Institute to develop a kind of proto-Siri, a virtual office assistant that might help military personnel to do their jobs. Twenty universities were brought into the project, furiously working on all the different technologies necessary to make a voice-activated virtual assistant a reality. Seven years later, the research was commercialised as a start-up, Siri Incorporated- and it was only in 2010 that Apple stepped in to acquire the results for an undisclosed sum. As for hard drives, lithium-ion batteries, liquid crystal displays and semiconductors themselves - there are similar stories to be told. In each case, there was scientific brilliance and plenty of private sector entrepreneurship. But there were also wads of cash thrown at the problem by government agencies - usually US government agencies, and for that matter, usually some arm of the US military. Silicon Valley itself owes a great debt to Fairchild Semiconductor - the company that developed the first commercially practical integrated circuits. And Fairchild Semiconductor, in its early days, depended on military procurement. Of course, the US military didn't make the iPhone. Cern did not create Facebook or Google. These technologies, that so many people rely on today, were honed and commercialised by the private sector. But it was government funding and government risk-taking that made all these things possible. That's a thought to hold on to as we ponder the technological challenges ahead in fields such energy and biotechnology. Steve Jobs was a genius, there's no denying that. One of his remarkable side projects was the animation studio Pixar - which changed the world of film when it released the digitally animated film, Toy Story. Even without the touchscreen and the internet and the Fast-Fourier-Transform, Steve Jobs might well have created something wonderful. But it would not have been a world-shaking technology like the iPhone. More likely it would, like Woody and Buzz, have been an utterly charming toy.

"It comes after the Treasury Select Committee said his evidence had fallen well short of its expected standards. The scandal emerged in June when UK and US authorities fined Barclays £290m for fixing a key inter-bank interest rate. Mr Diamond said he was disappointed and strongly disagreed with several of the committee's statements. The committee blamed bank bosses for ""disgraceful"" behaviour which damaged the UK's reputation. In a report, it said urgent changes to the way banks are run and regulated were needed to restore public confidence after the scandal. Mr Diamond was criticised as MPs published the initial findings of a probe into the circumstances surrounding the fixing of the Libor rate, which sets inter-bank lending prices. But the former chief executive, who resigned the day before he gave evidence to MPs, said he strongly challenged ""certain assertions"" about his testimony. ""I answered every question that was put to me to me truthfully, candidly and based on information available to me,"" he said. ""I categorically refute any suggestion to the contrary."" 'Reprehensible behaviour' Mr Diamond said he had taken particular issue with the attacks on Barclays' culture and character. ""There is no question that the behaviour of a small group of traders related to Libor manipulation was reprehensible and not in keeping with Barclays' high standards. ""At the same time, it should be recorded that broader issues with Libor have been a subject of discussion among regulators for years, and there is little dispute that Barclays was both aggressive in its investigation of this matter and engaged in its cooperation with the appropriate authorities. ""Looking forward, it's clear that thoughtful analysis and regulation of issues affecting the banking industry are required and I have no doubt that Barclays is committed to being part of the solution."" The MPs said the rate-rigging had done ""great damage"" to the UK's reputation. Committee chairman Andrew Tyrie said: ""The committee has called for action in a number of areas, including: higher fines for firms that fail to co-operate with regulators, the need to examine gaps in the criminal law, and a much stronger governance framework at the Bank of England. ""Urgent improvements, both to the way banks are run, and the way they are regulated, is needed if public and market confidence is to be restored."" The MPs firmly blamed the bosses of Barclays Bank for the way their staff tried to manipulate the Libor rate-setting process at various times between 2005 and 2009, in what the committee's chairman called a period of ""extremely weak internal compliance and board governance at Barclays"" and a ""failure of regulatory supervision"". ""Senior management at Barclays were issuing instructions to manipulate artificially the bank's submissions. It is unlikely that Barclays was the only bank attempting this,"" said Mr Tyrie. The Conservative MP said Mr Diamond's evidence was at times ""highly selective"" and ""fell well short of the standard that Parliament expects, particularly from such an experienced and senior witness"". The MPs accused Barclays of trying to pull the wool over their eyes by publishing - before Mr Diamond's committee appearance - a note of a phone conversation between Mr Diamond and Paul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England. Barclays had said this showed the Bank of England had inadvertently given the impression that it would approve attempts by Barclays to submit low and inaccurate Libor submissions, in order to avoid giving the impression that it was having difficulty in raising funds at the height of the financial crisis. ""It remains possible that the information released in the Barclays file note, regarding a dialogue between Mr Tucker and [Mr] Diamond, could have been a smokescreen put up to distract our attention and that of outside commentators from the most serious issues underlying this scandal,"" Mr Tyrie said. ""Barclays did not need a nod, a wink or any signal from the Bank of England to lower artificially their Libor submissions. The bank was already well practised in doing this,"" the report says. Responding to the MPs' report, Barclays said that although it did not expect to agree with all the findings, it will ""carefully consider this comprehensive report"" and recognised that change was required, adding that it had established an independent review of its business practices for that reason. Labour's Chris Leslie said the chancellor would need to take ""significant steps in the current Banking Reform Bill and beyond"" in order to ""rebuild public and global market confidence in the UK financial services sector"".","Former Barclays chief Bob Diamond has hit back at claims he was ""highly selective"" in his evidence to MPs during the Libor rate-rigging scandal."
"The second takeover offer has come from South African retailer Steinhoff, which offered 175p per share. Sainsbury's has until 23 February to make a firm offer for Argos. Home Retail Group said the board was reviewing the Steinhoff proposal and it would make a further announcement soon. A spokesperson added: ""Home Retail Group shareholders are advised to take no action at this time."" Sainsbury's second offer for Home Retail Group came after an offer of £1bn was rejected. Steinhoff, which owns the furniture chain Harvey's in the UK, makes most of its products in developing countries, and sells its furniture across Europe. The South African retailer said its offer would not disrupt the sale of Homebase, which Home Retail Group is in the process of selling to Australian retail company Wesfarmers. The firm plans to bring its Bunnings chain to the UK. Sainsbury's, like other UK supermarkets, has faced intense competition from discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl. Chief executive Mike Coupe said if the takeover went ahead the combination of the two companies would create the UK's ""food and non-food retailer of choice"", with 2,000 stores. The tie-up would create the UK's largest general merchandise retail business. Mr Coupe said that the merger would bring savings in the region of £120m - half of which would come from putting Argos stores into Sainsbury's supermarkets. Meanwhile Steinhoff has until the 18th March to make a firm offer.",Home Retail Group has received a £1.4bn rival bid for Argos after supermarket Sainsbury's offered £1.3bn for the company.
"Operating profit was 6.72tn won ($5.9bn; £3.8bn) in the second quarter, a 79% jump from a year earlier. Samsung, which makes the Galaxy range of smartphones, overtook Nokia as the world's biggest maker of mobile phones earlier this year. Analysts said Samsung's earnings were likely to rise further in the future. ""Given the situation that 60% of Samsung's profits come from smartphones and smartphone-related components, the growing profit in handsets sales will make up for the loss in TV or traditional electronic devices,"" said Kim Young-chan of Shinhan Investment Corp. ""Samsung's earnings will reach the peak in the third quarter."" Further dominance? While Samsung has been increasing its share of the smartphone market, competitors such as Research in Motion, the maker of Blackberry phones, have not been doing as well. At the same time, Apple, which is considered to be Samsung's biggest competitor, has yet to announce when it will launch the latest version of its popular iPhone. Analysts said they expected the model to be launched in the final quarter of this year, which they said could help Samsung's cause. Song Myung-sub of HI Investment & Securities said that the new iPhone was coming out in October, so it will not have much impact on Samsung sales in the third quarter. ""The expected sales of Galaxy S III this quarter are 6.8 million and for the next quarter we forecast 15 million phones to be sold."" ""Just this area would bring 8tn won in sales increase."" According to report by research firm Strategy Analytics, Samsung shipped 93 million mobile phones in the second quarter, accounting for 26% of the global market share. Key risks However, the firm also faces some risks, not least from the ongoing legal battles with Apple. The two firms are fighting cases in multiple countries over claims of patent infringement. The cases have resulted in some of Samsung's products, such as its Nexus smartphones and the Galaxy tab 10.1 tablet PC, being banned in the US. However, some cases have also been decided in favour of Samsung. But analysts said that the disputes were still a problem for the company. ""The biggest risk Samsung is facing might be patent issues, as stocks can respond negatively to this uncertainty,"" said Mr Kim of Shinhan Investment Corp. At the same time, the electronics maker is also facing slowing demand and falling prices for memory chips. Samsung, which is the world's biggest memory chip maker, said that sales at the division had fallen by 6% during the quarter. ""Weak memory chip prices remain the biggest concern for Samsung in the third quarter,"" said Seo Won-Seok of Korea Investment & Securities.","Samsung Electronics has reported a record quarterly profit, boosted by a surge in smartphone sales and improved margins in its TV business."
"Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association (BBA), said banks were spending £3bn a year upgrading systems. About 600,000 transactions were delayed as a result of the processing problem at the RBS group on Wednesday. The bank said that the backlog would be cleared by the end of Saturday. Digital banking Payments of wages, tax credits and disability living allowance were among those that failed to be credited to accounts of customers at RBS, NatWest, Ulster Bank and private bank Coutts. The underlying problem was fixed on Wednesday morning but many of those affected are angry that it will take until the end of the week for all payments to go through. Mr Browne, of the BBA, told the BBC the incident was unacceptable, repeating RBS's admission on Wednesday. ""The banks are already aware of this as an issue,"" Mr Browne said. ""A lot of them have creaking IT systems. They are spending £3bn a year upgrading their IT systems - it is one of the biggest IT upgrades that Britain has ever seen."" Most banks and building societies regularly suffer from online banking glitches, such as a problem at Nationwide earlier in the week, despite promoting the increased use of digital banking. During a presentation on banking technology on Thursday, Simon McNamara, of RBS, said it was not feasible for a system to be faultless for 100% of the time. ""Technology will, on occasion, fail. If and when that occurs, we need to ensure we can mask the impact on customers and recover as quickly and effectively as possible,"" he said. ""It is important that it is handled well and competently.""","Banks have ""creaking"" computer systems but the payments failure at RBS was ""unacceptable"", the head of the UK banking body has said."
"It made $6.9bn (£4.5bn) profit in the three months to June, thanks in part to good sales of its iPhone smartphone. Apple said it sold 31.2 million iPhones, a record for the June quarter, compared to 26 million last year. But profit was down 22% from the same period a year earlier as its profit margins shrank to 36.98% from 42.8%. However, average sale prices were lower at $581, compared with $608 a year ago. Its revenue was also better than expected, with the company earning $35.3bn, although that was barely above the $35bn of a year ago. Analysts said the data, especially on iPhone sales, may help allay some fears of a slowdown in Apple's growth rate. ""The iPhone number should provide some comfort to investors who were worried about smartphone demand,"" said Shannon Cross of Cross Research. ""That's one of the reasons the stock is up. Expectations were not strong for this quarter."" Outstripped One of the brakes on the robust pace of growth that Apple has enjoyed in recent years has been the growing popularity of rivals such as Samsung - which has now become the world's biggest mobile phone maker - as well as the launch of low-cost smartphone by Chinese manufacturers. According to its latest numbers, Apple's sales in China were also down by 4% in the April to June period. Research firm IDC has estimated that 66% of the 385 million smartphones sold in China next year will cost less than $200 - significantly less than the cost of Apple's iPhone. That has led some investors to fear that Apple may have to cut the price of its products in an attempt to attract customers. At the same time, sales of its the iPad tablet computer, fell by 14% to 14.6 million units, compared with 17 million a year ago. New products Apple has spent most of the past 10 years as the darling of consumers and investors. But a lack of new products - its last innovation was the iPad in 2010 - has seen faith in it wane recently, and strong competition from South Korea's Samsung in particular, has also eaten into its market share. That has seen investors dump the stock. Its shares have dipped nearly 40% since hitting the peak in September last year. This is the second quarter in a row that the technology giant's earnings have been below those of the previous year. Analysts said that while the latest numbers were better than they had estimated, the company needed to come up with new products in order to keep growing at a robust pace. ""This was a 'blah' quarter and the story hasn't changed,"" said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of Sarhan Capital. ""Until it delivers a new, innovative product that really adds to both top and bottom-line, I would expect the stock to continue treading water."" For his part, Apple's boss. Tim Cook, said that the company was going to introduce new products soon. ""We are laser-focused and working hard on some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall [autumn] and across 2014,"" he said.",Shares of computer and smartphone maker Apple rose nearly 5% in after-hours trading after it reported better-than-expected profits for the third quarter.
"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will look into whether the deal will mean less consumer choice, higher prices or worse service. The combined group would be the UK's biggest retail chain with 2,800 stores and 31.4% of the grocery market. The CMA will also look at whether the merged company could use its size to squeeze the prices it pays suppliers. Sainsbury's and Asda - which has been owned by US retail giant Walmart since 1999 - are the second and third largest supermarkets in the UK. Under the terms of the deal, Walmart would retain 42% of the combined business. As well as being major retailers of groceries, both in-store and online, Sainsbury's and Asda also compete to sell goods such as fuel, electrical products, toys and clothing. Analysis by retail property experts Maximise UK estimated that the CMA will recommend that 6%, or 73, of the combined group's supermarkets should be sold off. Others have speculated that up to 300 sites could have to be divested. The chief executive of the CMA, Andrea Coscelli, said: ""About £190bn is spent each year on food and groceries in the UK so it's vital to find out if the millions of people who shop in supermarkets could lose out as a result of this deal. ""We will carry out a thorough investigation to find out if this merger could lead to higher prices or a worse quality of service for shoppers and will not allow it to go ahead unless any concerns we find are fully dealt with."" In the past few months the CMA has been gathering the information needed to start what is known as Phase 1 of the inquiry. This is where it works out whether the deal can be cleared relatively quickly or whether it needs to be looked at in more detail in a Phase 2 investigation. Both Sainsbury's and Asda have asked the CMA to fast-track Phase 1 so it can move rapidly on to the in-depth Phase 2 inquiry.",The UK's competition watchdog has launched an investigation into the proposed Sainsbury's-Asda merger.
"The 2011 suit related to the company's UK phone-hacking scandal and the purchase of a UK TV production firm.

News Corp said it ""acknowledges the meaningful role the plaintiffs"" played in improving corporate governance. The company agreed to adopt enhanced measures as part of the derivative settlement. In a derivative suit, shareholders, acting on behalf of the company, sue against executives to rectify a wrong in a firm. ""We are pleased to have resolved this matter,"" News Corp said in a statement. ""The agreement reflects the important steps News Corporation has taken over the last year to strengthen our corporate governance and compliance structure and we have committed to building on those efforts going forward."" 'No effective oversight' Trustees of Amalgamated Bank of New York and the Central Laborers Pension Fund, which are both News Corp shareholders, first filed a lawsuit in March 2011. It was directed against News Corp's directors for overpaying when the company bought Shine Group, a UK TV production company, from News Corp's chairman and chief executive Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth. They claimed that the takeover deal was ""unfairly"" priced and that the News Corp board of directors failed to challenge Mr Murdoch about the terms of the transaction. The pair then expanded their lawsuit in July 2011, to accuse the board of providing ""no effective review or oversight"" and permitting a ""culture run amok"" at the News of the World, which News Corp owned. The extent of phone hacking at the tabloid, then owned by News Corp, led to its closure in 2011. ""We are proud of this historic settlement, which continues the 20 year history of Amalgamated Bank encouraging corporate reform and improved corporate governance,"" Amalgamated Bank president and chief executive Edward Grebow said in a statement. News Corp is expected to start a new life as a publishing company when it splits from its TV and film interests in June this year.",News Corp has reached a $139m (£91m) settlement with shareholders over complaints filed against the company's board of directors.
"By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC News But many will go home financially worse off than when they arrived. Anna (not her real name) has worked as a model since she was 17, appearing on the catwalk for Prada, Mulberry, Comme des Garcons and many others. But after three years, she still hasn't managed to pay off all the £10,000 she owes to her modelling agencies. ""My debt situation started right away when I started modelling,"" she tells the BBC. The first agency Anna signed with, in her home country in western Europe, advanced her £350 for taking test photographs, a cost that was added to an account in her name. Later she was flown to London for a casting, and that cost was also added to her account, including accommodation and living expenses. The amount she owed mounted. ""They would ask me if I wanted a driver, without being clear that this is very expensive, and that I have to pay for it,"" she says. The problem for fashion models is that while their agencies will typically pay for their flights, accommodation and expenses up front, it is standard industry practice that they want the money back. So if a model travels to the latest London Fashion Week, which starts on Friday, and doesn't get work, they will be in debt to their agency for the amount it spent getting her or him there. Anna had this problem, when aged 18 she flew to the US for castings at New York Fashion Week, but ultimately couldn't attend any due to falling sick. For two years she says she received next to no pay, as her agencies in Paris, London and New York directed her fees to pay off all the money she owed. Ekaterina Ozhiganova says it's time to address the hidden problem of debt that models rack up as they try to make a career in one of the most precarious professions in the world. A Russian model working in Paris, she co-founded Model Law, the first French association working to protect models' rights. ""It used to be that sexual violence was taboo,"" she says. ""Now everyone is shouting on every corner about sexual exploitation, but no-one wants to talk about money. Everyone is shutting their mouths about it."" Because success in the industry is partly measured by the amount you earn, working models rarely want to speak out about the problem. But behind the scenes, Ms Ozhiganova says Model Law is helping models better understand their finances. ""The lack of information is the main problem"" she says. ""The models don't know what they are supposed to receive."" While models from all countries can get into financial difficulties, those from poorer nations can be more vulnerable. ""It's like any worker who comes from abroad to a more prosperous economy,"" says Ms Ozhiganova. ""There's a big difficulty in language, they can't read the paperwork, the contract. They are jumping into a void."" Compounding the problem, the pool of aspiring models is so large that work is spread thinly and pay can be very low. Some jobs in magazines, for example, are unpaid. Otherwise fees can range from £50 a day, to £1,000 or more for taking part in a show during a fashion week or tens of thousands for featuring in a brand's campaign. However, model debt is not debt in any ordinary sense of the term, says John Horner, director of the British Fashion Models Association, representing UK agencies. If a young model fails to make it and leaves the industry, she isn't pursued for the money she ""owes"" he says. Instead the agency writes off the investment. ""It is not hanging round the models like [UK payday loan provider] Wonga,"" he says. ""We carry the debt."" He says the London-based agency he runs, Models 1, has £60,000 of models' debt sitting on its books, which may never be paid off, if the models' careers don't take off. He says agencies are obliged to give models monthly itemised bills listing the charges to their accounts, but he's not sure they always get read. Most successful models soon pay off the initial investment and start earning on their own account, he says. Esther Kinnear-Derungs is the co-founder of Linden Staub, a small agency set up in London three years ago to pioneer ways to treat models better. She says that advancing and recouping costs is the ""nature of the business"". The problem is the girls are seen as ""disposable"" by many agencies, she says, and it's an open secret that at fashion weeks some big agencies take the approach that hundreds of girls can be ""thrown against the wall to see what sticks"". She says it's often girls from eastern Europe who are most vulnerable. Their parents are happy to send them abroad, believing it's their ""big break"", and they don't ask enough questions. The girls themselves have no experience at managing their own finances or careers. ""We believe we have a responsibility to educate the model from day one, whether she was scouted in Siberia, Africa or London,"" says Ms Kinnear-Derungs. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Candice (also not her real name), is a French model of east African descent. She says she had no idea when she started out that she was being charged for travel and expenses. ""When you get your first job, that's how you realise it wasn't free. ""You go and ask about your pay and they say, 'You don't have money because you're in debt.' Then you understand,"" she says. She says even if agencies are ultimately carrying the financial risk, there's a psychological burden on the models. ""It always feels like a gamble to make the journey to fashion week with the risk you'll go home owing more than when you arrived,"" she says. ""Maybe 40%, maybe more, go home with zero. That is why it is so stressful.""","As fashion weeks follow hot on each other's heels in New York, London, Milan and Paris, hundreds of models are travelling to the four fashion capitals in the hope of getting work."
"A subsidiary of the Intercontinental Exchange Group (ICE), a global network of exchanges and clearing houses, has been appointed to ensure Libor cannot be rigged by banks again. The Financial Conduct Authority has authorised ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) to do the job from 1 February. Libor is the rate at which London banks lend short-term money to each other. The British Bankers' Association was stripped of its Libor-setting role in 2012 following a series of rate-rigging scandals that led to multi-million pound fines for a number of international banks. The Wheatley Review into the scandal had identified the need for a new independent administrator for Libor. ""Libor is of fundamental importance to the global financial markets and it is vital that market participants have full confidence in the integrity of the rate,"" said IBA president Finbarr Hutcheson. ""With the support of market participants, regulators and stakeholders, and through enhanced checks and controls, IBA will work collaboratively to ensure full confidence in Libor,"" he added. Rate rigging Between January 2005 and June 2009, Barclays derivatives traders made a total of 257 requests to fix Libor and Euribor, the European equivalent rate, according to a report by the Financial Services Authority. The scandal ultimately led to the resignation of Barclays chief Bob Diamond and fines for the bank totalling £290m imposed by UK and US authorities. In October 2013, Dutch-owned Rabobank was fined 774m euros (£640m) for its role in the Libor rate-fixing scandal. Other banks, such as HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland, were also implicated. ICE says the new administrator had ""built a robust oversight and governance framework that includes an independent board with a majority of independent non-executive directors"". Andre Villeneuve, formerly chairman of the City of London's International Regulatory Strategy Group, will be IBA's chairman. And Joanna Perkins, chief executive of the Financial Markets Law Committee, will act as chair of the IBA's oversight committee.",A new body has been appointed to administer Libor - the London Interbank Offered Rate.

"Operating profits at its residential energy supply business fell 11% last year to £553m, from £623m in 2015. The company said this was partly due to a 3% fall in customer accounts, largely in the first half of the year. The owner of British Gas, Centrica, reported a 4% rise in operating profit for 2016 to £1.52bn. ""The big message is that it's very competitive out there actually,"" said Iain Conn, chief executive of Centrica. ""We have seen increased metering and other costs coming through. We lost customers in the first half of last year. We are seeing pressure on our margins because there are 50 suppliers out there."" British Gas is one of the UK's ""big six"" energy suppliers, and there has been concern that these six companies are too dominant, limiting competition. Earlier this month, the energy regulator Ofgem announced a cap on charges for pre-payment customers, and the government is due to publish a Green Paper in April which may further restrict the prices energy companies can charge customers. But Mr Conn said: ""I don't think this market is in any need of further government intervention. ""Standard tariffs are actually good value and our standard tariff is demonstrably good value and I think the government are understanding that this market is starting to change."" However, the government is concerned that two-thirds of all energy consumers remain on standard tariffs, which are the most expensive deals. Loyalty programme British Gas recently announced it was freezing its tariffs until August, against a backdrop of rising prices at some other large energy companies. Big six rivals Npower, EDF and Scottish Power have all announced price rises in 2017. Npower was told by the regulator Ofgem to ""justify"" its 15% rise in electricity prices to its customers. Mr Conn suggested some smaller independent suppliers were not making a profit. ""Some of them appear to be offering energy at a loss to them, and I'm not sure how sustainable that is. But some of the more vocal independent suppliers - actually their standard variable tariffs are above ours."" British Gas has also announced a loyalty scheme to reward existing customers. They will be able to get deals on TV packages, boiler maintenance, and reduced energy bills.",British Gas has said the competitive nature of the UK's energy market was one of the reasons why its profits fell last year.
"""Head-to-head competition is uncommon,"" the commission said, as it outlined measures to improve the situation. Bus firms will be banned from ""over-bussing"" and other short-term measures designed to keep out new rivals. They will also have to share bus stations with competitors and accept ""multi-operator ticketing schemes"". The Confederation of Passenger Transport UK (CPT), which represents bus companies, said it could not agree with all the commission's findings. CPT chief executive Simon Posner said there was ""always room for improvement and we will now have a closer look at the changes that have been suggested"". He called the commission's investigation ""long and time-consuming"", and said ""the single biggest message to come out of this process is that, while measures need to be taken to further open up the market to competition, the current commercialised framework for delivering bus services is what serves the passenger best"". A spokesman for bus operator Arriva said the company would ""consider the lengthy report carefully"", but did ""regret that the CC seems not to have taken this opportunity to address the impact of competition from private transport which is the main reason behind falling usage of what is a very efficient bus industry"". Avoiding competition UK bus services were first deregulated 25 years ago, with the exception of London and Northern Ireland. However, according to Jeremy Peat, chairman of the Competition Commission's local bus market investigation group, the ""reality is that in too many areas of the country, competition has stagnated and the incumbent providers know that they face little in the way of serious challenge"". ""As such, the incentive to increase services, innovate and even lower fares is absent."" The commission's report found that in one area, the north-east of England, it had seen ""direct evidence"" of bus firms avoiding ""competition with each other in order to protect their own territories"". Keeping rivals out However, deregulation had failed to deliver the ""sustained competition"" that allowed companies to take on existing providers of bus services, the commission found. It blamed ""operator behaviour"" for keeping rivals out, with some companies using short-term measures such as suddenly increasing the frequency of their bus services until a rival had left the market. There are 1,245 bus companies operating in England, Scotland and Wales, but just five of them: Arriva, FirstGroup, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach, carry 70% of all passengers. The commission said the Office of Fair Trading should exercise ""its discretion not to refer small mergers"" of bus operators to the Competition Commission. Local Transport Authorities, meanwhile, are being asked to consider ""partnerships"" with new operators to increase competition in their local areas.","A lack of competition in the UK's local bus market has meant poorer services and higher fares for passengers, the Competition Commission has said."
"""We need to further harmonise policies and standards and establish 'fast tracks' to facilitate the orderly flow of people,"" he said. The codes will be used to help establish a traveller's health status. But Human Rights advocates warn that the codes could be used for ""broader political monitoring and exclusion"". Mr Xi made the comments at the G20 summit, an online meeting of heads of state from the world's 20 largest economies, which was hosted by Saudi Arabia over the weekend. He said the codes could be used to recognise ""health certificates based on nucleic acid test results"", according to a transcript published by Chinese state news agency Xinhua. Mr Xi didn't go into further detail about how the travel scheme might work, or how closely it would be modelled on China's QR code apps, which have been used to help contain the virus on the mainland. ""We hope more countries will join this mechanism,"" he added. QR codes are bar codes that can be read by mobile phones. Under the scheme China has employed since February, users are issued a traffic-light style health code, with a green code allowing someone to travel freely, and an orange or red code indicating that they need to quarantine for up to two weeks. The codes are based on a combination of big data and information submitted by the users themselves. The technology was developed by financial technology giant Ant Financial, and is available through its main app Alipay, but also on WeChat, which belongs to Alipay's competitor Tencent. Mr Xi also called for the re-opening of the global economy, including restoring ""global and industrial supply chains"" and the ""liberalisation of trade of key medical supplies"". Reopening travel lanes remains a challenge for most countries, with spikes in the disease making it difficult for authorities to lift travel restrictions. A travel bubble between Singapore and Hong Kong, for example, was postponed shortly before it was due to start this weekend due to a sudden spike in cases in Hong Kong. 'Trojan Horse' In a tweet, the executive director of Human Rights Watch Kenneth Roth expressed caution over Mr Xi's proposal. ""An initial focus on health could easily become a Trojan Horse for broader political monitoring and exclusion,"" he said. The city of Hangzhou has said it plans to make a permanent version of the QR code-based software, which would be used to assign citizens a personal score based on their medical history, health check-ups and lifestyle habits. QR codes have been used differently elsewhere. In Singapore and Australia, for example, they're used for contract tracing, with residents using them to check into and out of places they visit, including malls, restaurants and their places of work.","Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for a ""global mechanism"" that would use QR codes to open up international travel."
"A group of 10 current and former top staff - including the firm's co-founders and former boss - made the claim in a lawsuit filed in New York. They are seeking at least $2bn (£1.57bn) in damages from the parent firms IAC and subsidiary, Match Group. IAC and Match said they would fight the suit, calling the claims ""meritless"". The two firms said the valuation occurred under a ""rigorous, contractually-defined"" process. The plaintiffs ""did not like the outcome,"" they said, adding that Match has paid out more than $1bn in equity compensation to Tinder's co-founders and employees. ""We look forward to defending our position in court."" Tinder launched in 2012 on the back of the explosion in smartphone use. Just two years later it was registering more than a billion ""swipes"" a day. The app is one of several brands that falls under the Match Group umbrella. Media giant IAC owns the majority of Match, which it spun out as an independent, publicly-traded company in 2015. The lawsuit concerns share options granted to certain Tinder staff in 2014, which gave them the right to buy Tinder shares at pre-set times, starting in 2017. 'False picture' The employees, who include three co-founders and several current executives, say IAC/Match created a ""false picture"" of Tinder's financial condition and prospects in order to reduce the value of stock options awarded. For example, during the valuation, IAC/Match estimated that Tinder would bring in $454m in revenue in 2018, according to the filing. This month, Match told investors Tinder's 2018 revenue would be about $800m. ""When it came time to pay the Tinder employees what they rightfully earned, the defendants lied, bullied, and violated their contractual duties, stealing billions of dollars,"" the attorney for the plaintiffs, Orin Snyder of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, said in a statement. The employees also accuse IAC/Match of overlooking sexual misconduct by a Match Group executive.","Tinder's parent companies have been accused of undervaluing the dating app, cheating executives out of billions of dollars worth of stock options."
"The cancellations came after it was revealed the budget carrier neglected to carry out safety inspections on about one fifth of its planes. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) later ruled that the airline could fly the uninspected planes for a maximum of five days as safety checks take place. ""The airline is working quickly to resolve the situation,"" said Southwest. In a statement, the airline said that it discovered that a check on the standby hydraulic system on about 128 of its Boeing 737 planes was overdue. ""Southwest immediately and voluntarily removed the affected aircraft from service, initiated maintenance checks, disclosed the matter to the FAA, and developed an action plan to complete all overdue checks,"" it said. After grounding those affected planes for about six hours - leading to 80 flight cancellations - the FAA told the airline it could continue to fly the planes that missed the inspections. Southwest, which is the world's biggest discount carrier, has approximately 665 Boeing 737 planes in its fleet as of 2014. The airline has been in trouble with regulators before. Last May, it was fined for deceptive advertising tactics. In 2011, the airline came under fire after a hole opened up in one of its plane cabins mid flight, and a subsequent inspection revealed three other planes suffered from similar cracks that led to the fissure.",US airline Southwest was briefly forced to ground some flights on Tuesday.
"By Sean CoughlanBBC News education and family correspondent Imperial College London, one of the world's top science institutes, has created a joint maths laboratory in London with the biggest government research body in France, the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). It means that Imperial's researchers, or those from other UK institutions working at the Unite Mixte Internationale (UMI) Abraham de Moivre, will have the same funding status as those in France, even after the UK's withdrawal from the EU. ""All members of the UMI, whatever their nationality, will have equal access to funding, resources and most importantly, opportunities for collaboration,"" said an Imperial spokesman. ""This could include Imperial or other researchers seconded as members of the UMI Abraham de Moivre."" This is the first time that the French government has co-funded such a research unit in the UK - and from the French perspective, this new centre in London will have the same status as a laboratory in France. The Anglo-French maths centre was planned before the referendum, but it will provide a model of co-operation and a shared approach to funding which will stretch beyond the UK's exit from the EU. UMI director Richard Craster, professor of applied mathematics at Imperial, said the project showed a commitment to ""strengthening our ties with Europe by improving mobility and giving new opportunities for researchers to exchange ideas"". Named after an 18th-Century French mathematician who worked in London, the laboratory has the aim of ""bringing together some of the world's best mathematicians"". The French ambassador said it would ""provide a window to reach out to the UK mathematical community at large"". Imperial College says work at the laboratory will advance knowledge in ""number theory, mathematical analysis, biomathematics and financial mathematics"". Imperial, ranked eighth in the QS World University Rankings, already has more than 200 French staff and almost 700 French students at its south Kensington base. President Prof Alice Gast said the new project ""reinforces Imperial's exceptionally strong academic ties with France, as well as our determination to deepen collaborations with European partners"". In the wake of the EU referendum result, she had promised to ""vigorously defend our international values"" and said that ""political changes"" would not restrict the college's research work. ""Imperial is and will remain a European university,"" she had told staff and students. The UK's universities have been among the biggest net beneficiaries of EU research funding. But there have been concerns about the loss of access to whatever scheme follows the current Horizon 2020, which has provided 80bn euro (£71bn) in research funding. There have also been warnings from UK universities about their academics missing out on international projects commissioned through European research frameworks.

"By Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter When Facebook bought the photo app Instagram in 2012 for a cool $1bn (£760m), eyebrows were raised at the value the tech giant had placed on this 18-month-old start-up. Fast forward to 2017, and while Instagram may still be Facebook's little sister, it has built a sizeable community of 700 million users - dwarfing both Twitter and Snapchat. With improved photo filters and the addition of Instagram Stories, a feature that lets users upload short videos that disappear after 24 hours, the platform has become a big hit with freelancers and small organisations looking to reach new audiences. So how can you use it to make money? ""Instagram is your shop front,"" says Donna McCulloch, a fashion stylist who works under the name Sulky Doll. ""People don't ask for business cards any more - they ask for your 'handle' [Instagram nickname]. It's instant - you both get your phones out, and you're connected."" For yoga instructor Cat Meffan, the glamorous images she posts of herself in impressive yoga positions in picturesque locations around the world are intended to inspire and motivate her 77,000 followers. But they also help her to build her business. ""I sold out my first yoga retreat in five days and all I did was put up one Instagram post,"" she says. ""I was extremely shocked and excited. That's the power of Instagram."" Cat says she'll spend up to an hour crafting the captions alongside her photos - sometimes more than she'll spend on taking the photo itself. ""Sometimes I'll go out and do a photoshoot with my partner. But usually it's me with a self-timer or holding the phone."" Like Donna, Cat finds adding hashtags to her photos a useful way of reaching a new audience. A search for #yoga, for example, will bring up her images, along with those of others, while Donna's #OOTD (Outfit of The Day) are by far her most popular. ""It's a nice way of finding like-minded people,"" says Cat. Both women also use the Stories feature to post videos which, they say, show them as they really are - an antidote to the artificial gloss that many Instagrammers are notorious for adding to their images. ""Stories allow people to get more of a handle on you as a person and a brand,"" says Donna. ""Stories are like peeking behind the net curtains. The biggest compliment is when people say you come across the same in real life as you do on your feed [Instagram page]."" Both Cat and Donna have built their Instagram pages tightly around a very specific theme - yoga/wellness and fashion, respectively. That's important if you want to grow the number of people who follow you says Danny Coy, a photographer with 173,000 followers who now also works as an Instagram consultant. For £300 a month his firm Vibrance says it can ""typically"" grow an account by 2,000 followers every four weeks. Techniques for attracting followers include posting regularly and having a bank of interesting images to hand. ""You don't have to post every day, but engagement peaks - after 24 hours it's done,"" he says. ""It's important to stick to your niche."" That's Instagram's advice, too. ""If you tell a different story every time you come to Instagram people will struggle to understand what you're trying to communicate,"" says Jen Ronan, the firm's head of small business for Europe, Middle East and Africa. ""Make sure you're thoughtful about what you want your customers to know and ensure that you're consistently reinforcing this over time."" Many of Danny's clients are companies, he says, who want to boost their numbers in order to look ""legitimate"" on the platform. ""From time to time it'll be an up-and-coming photographer who feels they can't get the numbers they deserve,"" he says. ""Everyone has to start somewhere."" Instagrammers with a significant number of followers may be approached by brands seeking ""influencers"" or ""ambassadors"" to represent them - for a fee. More Technology of Business Incorporating brand products and imagery into photos and videos can be a lucrative sideline, although you have to make clear which content is sponsored under Instagram rules. Donna McCulloch doesn't do it: ""I think I would lose my integrity,"" she says, although she does admit to wearing clothes she's been given. ""But it's because I wanted it,"" she maintains. And Cat Meffan says she spends a lot of time ""saying no"" to brands she doesn't think are right for her - but she does accept some. ""There's no set fee in the Instagram world,"" she says. ""You have a discussion [with the brand] and you have what you think you're worth."" Danny Coy says: ""Eighteen months ago I could easily be turning over £2,000-£3,000 a month in terms of influencer content."" But he says the market is tailing off because brands have wised up. If an Instagrammer tags a brand in a post independently, the brand can use the image without payment. ""Most will ask first,"" he says. ""But once you've tagged them and put it on Instagram they don't have to ask your permission."" But isn't it a bit of a turn-off being marketed to by people whose content you admire? And do viewers sometimes not realise they are looking at paid-for content? Mariann Hardey, assistant professor of marketing at Durham University, thinks the Instagram community isn't that gullible. ""It's easy to get het up that influencers are taking over and people don't understand they are seeing paid content, but the main users of Instagram are extremely savvy at being able to filter content that is branded or sponsored,"" she says. What's most important is ""whether the post is fun"" and the pictures are ""pretty"", she adds. So, the consensus seems to be that if the sponsored Instagrammer is well-liked and engaging, and the content is entertaining, Generation Instagram doesn't mind.","Instagram, the Facebook-owned photo app, has become a lucrative shop window for many small entrepreneurs. So what are the secrets of its success?"
"The Securities and Exchange Commission, a top US financial regulator, said Elizabeth Holmes and Theranos deceived investors about the firm's technology. The agency also said the firm had falsely claimed its products had been used by the US army in Afghanistan. Ms Holmes will lose control of the firm and be fined $500,000. An SEC official called the fallout an ""important lesson for Silicon Valley"". ""Innovators who seek to revolutionise and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today - not just what they hope it might do someday,"" said Jina Choi, director of the SEC's San Francisco regional office. Theranos was founded in 2003 when Ms Holmes was only 19, and sought to develop an innovative blood testing device. The firm said its Edison device could test for conditions such as cancer and cholesterol with only a few drops of blood from a finger-prick, rather than taking vials from a vein. In 2015 Forbes magazine estimated Ms Holmes' wealth at $4.5bn However, in the same year reports in the Wall Street Journal suggested the devices were flawed and inaccurate. By 2016 Forbes had revised its estimates of Ms Holmes' fortune to ""nothing"". Charges The charges were brought against Theranos and its former president Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani as well as Ms Holmes. The SEC plans to bring a case against Mr Balwani. The regulator alleged that Theranos, Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani made a series of false and misleading statements in investor presentations, product demonstrations and interviews. It said: ""Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani claimed that Theranos' products were deployed by the US Department of Defence on the battlefield in Afghanistan and on medevac helicopters and that the company would generate more than $100m in revenue in 2014. ""In truth, Theranos' technology was never deployed by the US Department of Defence and generated a little more than $100,000 in revenue from operations in 2014... ""In truth, according to the SEC's complaint, Theranos' proprietary analyser could complete only a small number of tests, and the company conducted the vast majority of patient tests on modified and industry-standard commercial analysers manufactured by others.""",The founder of a US start-up that promised to revolutionise blood testing has agreed to settle charges that she raised over $700m (£500m) fraudulently.
"By John MoylanIndustry correspondent, BBC News The TUC has confirmed that Frances O'Grady is to become its next general secretary, taking over from Brendan Barber at the end of the year. While she is little known outside the union movement, Ms O'Grady has ""diplomacy, charm and imagination,"" former TUC leader Lord Monks said. ""From early on, we identified her as a rising star,"" said Lord Monks, who was general secretary from 1993 to 2003. Who is she? Frances O'Grady is not a household name. Her just-created profile on Wikipedia is very brief, but in trade union circles she is well known and highly regarded and some believe she is about to shake up the image of the trade union movement. She joined the TUC in the mid 1990s and soon caught the attention of the then general secretary, Lord Monks. ""She's got diplomacy and charm, and imagination. She's got energy and dynamism and she's got the skills I believe that will make a very good general secretary,"" he said. She was born in Oxford in 1959, the youngest of five children. Her father was a shop steward at the British Leyland plant at Cowley. Her grandfather had been a founder member of the Irish Transport & General Workers Union. After studying politics and modern history at Manchester University, she soon became involved in trade unions in her working life, first at the T&G, now part of Unite, then at the TUC. In 2003, she became the first woman deputy general secretary of the TUC. Kevin Maguire, associate editor at the Daily Mirror, has known Frances O'Grady since the 1980s. ""She's very persuasive"" he says. ""She can sit people down and argue them into the ground."" Colleagues say that she is also in touch with union members at the grass roots level and can speak for the growing numbers of women in low paid, insecure jobs. David Miliband recently shared a platform with her at a TUC youth unemployment seminar. ""She knows that the modern world of employment has changed a lot, and she knows that trade unions have to be part of the solution to Britain's economic problems,"" he says. She also doesn't fit the traditional image of a trade union boss. ""She'll now be the public face of trade unions,"" says Mr Maguire. ""That will be a problem for [David] Cameron. He has a problem with women. She's quietly spoken... she could yet be his nemesis."" Challenges Frances O'Grady takes on the role of general secretary at a time of growing industrial unrest. The TUC is organising a mass demonstration against the government's austerity measures in October. Several unions are warning of strikes in the weeks and months ahead. There are also fresh tensions between some unions and the Labour Party. ""She will know that there will have to be an industrial strategy that will include strikes,"" says Mr Maguire. ""But she is also aware that there has to be a political and public opinion strategy to win people over. ""I suppose her critics will ask is she going to be strong enough to take unions through what is going to be a very difficult period.""","For the first time, a woman is set to lead Britain's Trades Union Congress."
"By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News, Ibiza But like many of the island's open air venues, Sa Trinxa has recently found itself having to fall in line with tough new regulations. This year, the bar was told it would have to turn down the music, and a limiter was installed to control the volume. ""People come here because of the music,"" says manager Álvaro. ""I like quiet places on my day off but this is Sa Trinxa."" The Ibizan authorities say that music in open air venues like Sa Trinxa must be capped at 65 decibels (dB) - slightly louder than a normal conversation but quieter than most vacuum cleaners. Andreas Simon is part of a community group called Musica Si, or ""Yes to Music"", that's been set up to fight the changes. He shows me a video that the group is sharing on social media. It points out that the average sound of traffic noise is 70dB, while an airliner landing reaches a volume of 110dB. Mr Simon says the authorities came to install a music limiter in one beach bar in the town of San Antonio at 7am one morning. Although the bar was empty and the music was off, the limiter showed a reading of 72dB. ""The owner asked, 'So who do you fine? The sea or the waves or the wind?'"" Mr Simon says the authorities' blanket approach to regulation isn't working. ""What we ask for is a specific solution for every venue. [If] one venue has no neighbours, it can have louder music. ""The government here wants to make people understand that music is noise. Music is not noise, music is a part of the culture. There has to be a reasonable solution because without music, this island is dead."" Marta, an Ibizan DJ who performs under the stage name Hofmann Lalióparda, agrees. She says that small venues located away from residential areas shouldn't be subject to the same rules as super clubs like Ushuaïa. ""They want to stop everything,"" she says. ""But we're bringing together different groups to join forces. Musicians, painters and people who love the arts. We're going to fight against these rules that are being imposed upon us. The little bit of culture this island has left is fast disappearing."" Illegal parties Last year, 3.2 million tourists visited Ibiza. Across the four Balearic Islands of Ibiza, Formentera, Majorca and Menorca tourism accounts for 45% of GDP and a third of all jobs. But balancing the tourism sector with the needs of local residents is proving increasingly difficult. When a socialist coalition took control of Ibiza's governing council in 2015, reining in tourism was central to their manifesto. Vicente Torres Ferrer is Ibiza's director of tourism. He says there is no problem with loud music in closed clubs and that Ibiza has ""the best discos in the world"", but when it comes to outdoor venues the residents must be considered. ""We know that music is very important for our offer in Ibiza, we don't want to stop that. The problem comes when we have illegal parties in private villas or music till very late at night in open places."" Mr Torres Ferrer says modern audio equipment can be used to keep music inside a venue, at a lower volume. ""If you have a terrace and you just have one unit hanging from a wall, you have to play the music very strongly so that it arrives at the last table. ""But if you have four units in a certain way, then the music doesn't go away. You can hear the music a little bit but it's very low."" 'Not enough police' Other changes are being made to tone down the island's image as a party destination. Bars in San Antonio's West End drinking strip now close at 3am instead of 5am. ""The early closing doesn't mean that San Antonio doesn't want nightlife. If you want to continue having a party, you can move to the discos and continue celebrating your fiesta there,"" says Mr Torres Ferrer. But many say the earlier curfew has simply pushed revellers on to the streets, and the real problem with San Antonio is a lack of police. Carlos is a taxi driver and an Ibizan native. ""There are so many drug dealers and there are not enough police in the street,"" he says. Martin Makepeace agrees. He moved to Ibiza from the UK in 1991 and describes himself as a prominent businessman in the San Antonio area. ""[Closing bars early has] caused more problems than it's solved. It's put thousands of people on the street earlier. At the end of the day, it's the crime on the streets that's the problem."" I ask him about reports of prostitution and mugging in San Antonio. ""It's true. There are gangs around who are intent on causing these kinds of problems,"" he says but argues it would be easy for the authorities to stamp out that behaviour if they wanted to. ""Ten more police on the street on a nightly basis would solve more or less anything, but unfortunately they're not able to do that."" Spending cuts So why aren't there more police? Ibiza's tourism director Vicente Torres Ferrer lays the blame squarely with the former government in Madrid and the budget cuts applied by then-Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. ""We had this economical problem all over the world, but Spain in particular had a very big problem,"" he explains. ""So they made very strong restrictions in order to contain the money spent by public administrations."" Ibiza has asked the new government in Madrid to allow it to spend more on basic services and employ more police. The island has also cracked down on accommodation sites, in an attempt to bring spiralling rental costs under control. It's now illegal for tourists to rent apartments on the island, while houses or villas can be rented only if property owners obtain a licence. Island exodus? Despite the changes, pressure is building for more to be done. A local group called Prou! - Catalan for ""Enough!"" - has 8,000 Facebook members. The group aims to ""defend and protect"" Ibiza from over-tourism and the crime, illegal construction and environmental damage it says comes with it. Yet some locals are running out of patience. Taxi driver Carlos says some of Ibiza's 140,000 permanent residents are considering leaving the island for good. ""Many local people who've lived here for the last 40 years, we're thinking about leaving because we don't like this Ibiza for our children,"" he says. In the last 10 years, many have left Ibiza to start new lives on Majorca or the Spanish mainland, he adds. The changes to music venues, bar opening hours and caps on accommodation do seem to be having an effect - tourist numbers were down 4% for the month of July and 3% in August, compared with last year. San Antonio businessman Martin Makepeace says the island is grappling with the age-old problem of how to balance the needs of residents and tourists. ""It's a chicken and egg situation. Without the residents you haven't got the tourists; without tourists, you haven't got the residents. We've got to find a compromise."" Listen to Vivienne's full report from Ibiza on Business Daily.","Sa Trinxa beach bar is located on the kind of white sandy beach that Ibiza is famous for. During the summer season, palm fronds hang from the roof, dance music pulses from the speakers and lithe, young beachgoers drop by for a late lunch and cold Spanish beers."
"Analysis from PwC and the Local Data Company revealed that the chains shut an average of 20 shops a day last year. The figure increased in the last three months of 2012 as a spate of household names went into administration. There was a decline in shops selling products such as computer games, cards and clothes, but a rise in payday loan providers, pound shops and bookmakers. Convenience stores opened by supermarkets were also taking over empty units. The survey found a reduction of nearly 1,800 shops for the whole of 2012, a 10-fold increase on the year before. According to the study, more High Street chains fell into insolvency in 2012 than ever before. High-profile administrations, such as Comet and Jessops, were not the only problem as other retailers also shed many stores when leases came up for renewal. With the rise of online shopping the chains did not need as many stores as they did in the past, a trend that looks set to accelerate this year. Matthew Hopkinson, from the Local Data Company, said: ""People have got less money in their pockets, employment is tighter and also we've seen a massive growth in the supermarkets in terms of non-food retail, and we've seen the internet go from nothing to 12% of retail sales - and that's forecast to be at least 30% by 2020. ""So people are shopping less and they're going to alternative channels."" But Professor Cary Cooper, a psychologist from Lancaster University, warned that community cohesion was damaged by the decline of the High Street. ""It's important psychologically and socially for families and communities that we have this, and seeing empty shops, seeing the kinds of shops that are now on the High Street, doesn't encourage communities or families,"" he said. 'Unheard of' The research found a total of 7,337 closures, compared with 5,558 new openings during the year. The regional breakdown showed the most net closures in the south-east of England, where 1,654 closures and 1,278 openings resulted in the loss of 376 shops. Scotland lost 353 and gained 276 shops, resulting in 77 net closures, while the figures for Wales showed a net loss of 65 shops following 213 closures and 148 openings. The figures were based on a survey of 500 town centres. BBC business correspondent Emma Simpson said the figures showed just how dramatic the fallout had been on Britain's High Streets. ""The scale of the net figure was something unheard of before the recession,"" she added. Mike Jervis, insolvency partner and retail specialist at PwC, said: ""The failed chains generally shared two problems - too many stores and too little multi-channel activity. ""A number of them had failed to deal with their underlying issues by hiding behind light touch restructuring processes, especially Company Voluntary Arrangements. 2013 has seen the downward trend become even worse.""","The number of stores closed by retail chains in Britain has soared over the past 12 months, according to research."
"By Matthew WallBusiness reporter, BBC News But she's a little too virtual for my tastes. Amelia is a ""learning cognitive agent"", according to her creators IPSoft - like one of those virtual customer service helpers that pop up on corporate websites. Only not so dumb and a lot less irritating. But one day, she could end up being your boss, her makers believe. Machine learning Amelia can swallow textbooks whole, speak 20 languages, understand concepts and learn from her mistakes. And she can be replicated any number of times. On my screen I see her absorb a complex engineering manual in 14 seconds then immediately answer questions such as ""What are the symptoms of a bent drive shaft?"" and ""What causes high power demand?"" This may be a far cry from Scarlett Johansson's uber-intelligent operating system Samantha in Spike Jonze's sci-fi film, Her, but it's the future, says Chetan Dube, IPSoft's chief executive. The key to Amelia's intelligence is that she can understand what you mean even if you ask the question several different ways - ""what is meant, not just what is said"", as Mr Dube puts it. And if she doesn't know the answer she can refer to human agents for help, observe how they handle the issue, then learn the answer for next time. This ability to interpret context, problem solve and learn is fundamental to automating many of the business processes now performed by humans, usually in large call centres, he believes. ""Machine intelligence is starting to rival human intelligence,"" he asserts. Algorithm director This machine learning intelligence is starting to work its way into the boardroom. For example in May, a Hong Kong-based venture capital company appointed an algorithm to its board of directors. Deep Knowledge Ventures (DKV) decided that a program, Vital, should have a say in what companies the firm invested in, based on its ability to analyse huge amounts of relevant data. Vital was developed by Aging Analytics, a UK research agency providing life science market intelligence to pension funds, insurers and governments. DKV says it has a ""long-term goal of developing the software to a point it is capable of autonomously allocating an investment portfolio"". And IBM, the tech giant behind the Watson supercomputer - famous for beating contestants on the US quiz show Jeopardy - is developing a version of the brainbox that could contribute to board meetings and help develop strategy. Boardroom Watson would be able to transcribe everything said in a meeting, show answers to research questions on a big screen, and also come up with its own suggestions consistent with company strategy based on algorithms and big data analytics. Worryingly for some, IBM says Watson would also be able to analyse the contributions made by each board member for usefulness and accuracy. Irrational So does this mean Amelia, Watson and their artificially intelligent siblings are threatening to take over completely? The strength of computers and smart machines lies in their ability to analyse vast data sets and make decisions based on evidence alone. Human judgement is often clouded by irrationality, emotion and imperfect knowledge. For example, when it comes to self-driving cars, proponents argue that letting machines make decisions for us could save lives by reducing the number of road accidents. A sensor-laden car wirelessly linked up to a traffic monitoring supercomputer would avoid dangerous situations, display much quicker reactions, keep to speed limits, and never succumb to road rage, they argue. Creative touch But what are the limits of the machine? Optimists believe smart robots and cognitive agents will rid us of the unskilled tasks and let us get on with what we humans are really good at - being creative. ""Today, most of us are enslaved to the common chores that occupy 80% of our time,"" says Mr Dube. ""Cognitive agents will free us from the mundane and allow us, or prompt us, to elevate ourselves into higher value creation - something that requires more creative thinking."" Tom Austin, of research company Gartner, agrees: ""Robots can free workers for higher-priority tasks and those tasks that require the greater creativity and adaptability people provide in non-routine situations."" But data analytics and algorithms can also lead us down blind alleys, believes James Quincey, Coca-Cola's Europe group president. ""It's easier to get lost in all the data - it can help us create a better yesterday rather than a better tomorrow,"" he said at a recent Institute of Directors convention at the Royal Albert Hall in London. ""We still need to rely on our gut instinct and develop a richer, more instinctive understanding of the consumer."" Data managers? And could machines ever really manage people? Data analytics will certainly have a bigger part to play in quantifying employees' performance and assessing their strengths and weaknesses, experts believe. Even psychometric testing can be automated. ""Data scientists, people from social science, computer scientists, people from HR [human resources], former consultants - these are the groups that are really going to shape how companies will work and grow,"" says Ben Waber, chief executive of Sociometric Solutions, one of the contributors to a recent report called The Future Workplace. But when it comes to human skills such as intuition, lateral thinking and emotional intelligence, machines lag far behind. ""Machines can at best be run-of-the-mill managers,"" says Mr Dube. ""Thinking creatively, out of the box, for implementing better business outcomes tomorrow is a domain where, today at least, man reigns supreme."" It may be some time yet before Amelia conquers the world.","I'm on a date with Amelia. She's neatly dressed, emotionally intelligent and whip-smart."
"By Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) has written to the Bank's governor, urging him to ensure any firms receiving Bank finance should disclose their climate-related activities. The letter adds to the drumbeat for change in the financial sector. The Bank said it was committed to reducing its impact on the climate. It added it would reply to the MPs in due course. 'Crunch point' The MPs focus on two areas of investment: Covid emergency funding and long-term corporate bonds. The committee says about 230 large companies are said to have been granted financial help to weather the Covid crisis. Many of them have a high impact on the climate or the environment. The list includes BASF chemicals, British Airways, Nissan, Rolls Royce, and EasyJet. A pressure group, Positive Money, estimates that by June last year 56% of Covid funding had been allocated to high-carbon sectors. It wants the Bank to withdraw completely from fossil fuel firms. The chancellor is due shortly to publish a revised remit for the Bank to align its investments with climate targets, and the UK government will be pushing the issue in the run-up to the forthcoming UN summit in Glasgow in November. The EAC's chairman, Philip Dunne, said: ""We are at a crunch point not only to mitigate the effects of climate change, but to rescue vast swathes of the economy from the impacts of coronavirus. ""It makes sense to tackle both together. (But) the Bank's corporate bond purchases are currently aligned with a catastrophic 3.5°C temperature rise by 2100. ""We are calling on the Bank to show leadership on climate change. It has a moral responsibility to align its corporate bond purchasing programme with the goals of Paris Agreement; and it should require companies receiving millions of pounds of taxpayers' money to publish climate-related financial disclosures."" 'Ambitious programme' A Bank of England spokesperson told the BBC: ""We have an ambitious work programme on climate change, from the stress testing of the largest UK banks and insurers against climate-related financial risks through to working internationally with the central bank network for greening the financial system. ""Work to consider how best to take account of climate considerations in our corporate bond portfolio is already underway at the Bank."" The EAC's intervention comes as the Bank is considering how to implement a change in mandate that will enable it to ""green"" its policies. The chancellor is expected to dictate changes in his March Budget. Financiers have been criticised for largely ignoring the seismic change being wreaked on governments due to the need to slash carbon emissions. Positive Money said: ""It's currently unclear exactly what this will mean in practice, but groups like Positive Money are putting pressure on the Treasury and the Bank for it to at the very least translate into fossil fuel assets being excluded from bond purchases, as central banks such as the Swiss National Bank have recently announced.""

"By Jane McMullenProducer, The Great Chinese Crash? With Robert Peston When prospective buyers enter the 900-home development ""Seaside Home"" along an avenue of Grecian columns, their eyes are meant to be drawn to three athletes, chiselled from fake bronze. At ""Starry Olympic City"", another development nearby, the statues are of pouting art deco girls. When it comes to putting the frozen city of Yingkou, near the border with North Korea, on the style map, the developers are not short of ambition. But one thing is missing. There aren't any prospective buyers. In fact, there are no people here at all. No cars on the eight-lane roads; no one in the Olympic-themed sports centre. As dark descends, light shines only from ""The Happy Pizza Hut"", Yingkou's brush with western cuisine. Whole apartment blocks are black. ""No one wants to live on this side of the river,"" explains a resident of the nearby old town. ""It's too far from everything. There are no jobs. It's a complete waste of money."" Among Yingkou's developers, ambition has given way to desperation. They admit privately they've only sold a fraction of their stock. None would risk talking publicly, but I get a rare opportunity to sit down with Wang Shi, founder and chairman of Vanke, the world's largest home builder by sales. ""It's a real problem,"" he concedes. ""Many cities have an oversupply of housing."" Wang's company Vanke also has a development at Yingkou. Harbour City promises a lifestyle more sun-kissed California than bleak northeast China. ""You only live once. You need a holiday,"" teases an advert. Wang admits the project has faced difficulties, but insists sales aren't bad, though my request to look around was politely declined. To a greater or lesser extent, every Chinese city is ringed by empty developments. Some will eventually be filled but, for the likes of Yingkou, that's surely impossible. China's housing binge over the last few years has been without parallel in human history. For a while it paid off, as construction drove breakneck economic growth. But far too much was built and in the wrong places. Social responsibility? Wang Shi seems unconcerned. ""In the west, if a city faces financial difficulties, it'll go bankrupt. But in China, cities will be subsidised by the Ministry of Finance. So some small- and medium-sized cities aren't worried about going bankrupt. They figure the central government will help them out."" This is an extraordinary assertion from a major Chinese developer: that companies and local governments can spend, safe in the knowledge that Beijing will open its wallet if they run into difficulty. But this free spending by local governments has helped inflate the biggest debt bubble in world history - and it can't go on forever. Now Wang Shi calls on China to address its economic problems. And he wants his company, Vanke, to help build a better future. ""We have influence. That prompts the question, is this influence there to bring a product to market? Or does it mean social responsibility, helping to shape the future of the market?"" Vanke's headquarters in Shenzhen in south-east China offers a taste of Wang's vision. A vertical glass and steel skyscraper: cutting edge, radical, low carbon. He's pioneering the development of pre-fabricated and low-carbon buildings. ""My next goal is for Shenzhen to become the model of environmentally-friendly and sustainable development."" Wang Shi: Global property magnate 1951: Born in 1951 Guangxi Province, China 1977: Graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Water Supply and Drainage, Faculty of the University of Lanzhou 1984: Established the Shenzhen Modern Scientific Education Equipment Distribution Centre, the predecessor of China Vanke 1988: Became chairman and general manager of China Vanke 1999: Resigned as general manager of China Vanke but remained as chairman 2003: Reached the summit of Mount Everest, the oldest Chinese national to do so 2005: Successfully trekked to the North and South Poles 2010: Reached the summit of Mount Everest again, breaking his own record 2011-2013: Visiting scholar at Harvard It's a shrewd move, tapping into the rising frustration felt by China's urban middle class at skyrocketing pollution levels. But as problems mount across China's property market, Vanke's profits have slowed. Their borrowing costs are rising, suggesting lenders are also now more cautious. But Vanke is in rude health compared to other smaller developers. In Yingkou, Seaside Home has been left as a bare concrete shell, never completed. Locals say the developer fled, wanted by the police. Nature is reclaiming the Grecian columns and the athletes. ""Eventually we will come a point where developers, banks and local governments need to realise that a significant part of the existing inventory [of empty housing] needs to be removed,"" says Credit Suisse's China property analyst Jinsong Du. ""But obviously that will have implications for the whole financial system. The bad debt held by many Chinese banks will shoot up significantly."" Eyes west As the risk of a banking crisis grows, it's no surprise that Wang Shi is looking for new opportunities abroad. He admits he is motivated partly by the need for safer investments to balance his higher-risk Chinese ones. He's also responding to the demands of Chinese customers, eager for homes in western markets. ""We are establishing an international network: San Francisco, New York, London, Berlin, Paris. We are targeting the Chinese market as they buy overseas."" The company has bought a stake in The Stage, a 40-floor development on the edge of the City of London. Wanda, another major Chinese developer, is building one of the tallest residential buildings in western Europe at Nine Elms in South London. But could this surge of Chinese property investment be dangerous for the UK, deepening British exposure to a future Chinese property crash? Credit Suisse's Jinsong Du says this is a valid concern, though he believes the Chinese government will stand behind its biggest developers if they run into difficulty. But for how much longer? The risk for overseas property markets is that Chinese investors might come with hidden strings attached - reaching all the way back to the ghost towns of China. This World: The Great Chinese Crash?

"Simon JackBusiness editor@BBCSimonJackon Twitter Melrose's pursuit of GKN is the first hostile takeover bid to go the distance for nearly a decade and, as such, is an important litmus test of the brand of capitalism at work in the UK today. As we contemplate the takeover of a venerable name with 60,000 employees by a smaller company that is much loved by the markets but mistrusted by unions and many politicians, the ghosts of Kraft, Cadbury, BHS and the smoke from the still smouldering wreck of Carillion hover in the mind. These were all very different disasters but there are some common denominators which are at play in the Melrose-GKN tussle. In all of them, there is a sense that the creation of value for shareholders meant the extraction of value for everyone else - like workers, suppliers and pension scheme members. Lessons learned? In the case of Kraft Cadbury it was closure of the Somerdale factory with the loss of 400 jobs days after it had completed the deal to buy the two hundred year old confectioner and something Kraft had expressly promised it wouldn't do. In the case of BHS, it was years of under investment in a once-loved high street brand as hundreds of millions were paid out in rents and dividends to a flamboyant billionaire before he dumped it for a pound to a three-time bankrupt. 10,000 jobs were lost and politicians and the public cried foul. Carillion was the UK's second biggest construction company until almost overnight it went into liquidation - not administration mind - there wasn't enough cash left to pay administrators to manage its decline. The company's destruction was total and rapid - just eight months after executives and its auditors had given the company a clean bill of health. As the company's dire predicament was becoming clear, executives were manoeuvring to protect their bonuses according to the findings of a committee of MPs. Contact sport The co-chair of that committee, Labour MP Frank Field has popped up in almost all of these episodes. He campaigned to have Sir Philip Green stripped of his knighthood, described the behaviour of Carillion executives as ""greed on stilts"" and raised an alarm over the potential threat posed by Melrose to the GKN pension fund. While he has been an effective high priest of moral outrage at corporate self interest - is it perhaps a bit naive to expect that there won't be a few casualties in a contact sport like free market economics? Not all forms of the game are the same. The UK has in the past played a particularly fast and loose version where the law of the market jungle is skewed in favour of those with a short term objective. As of today, nearly 25% of the shares are owned by investors who didn't have any interest in GKN three months ago. They are hedge funds who get involved because there is money to be made betting on the relative direction of the shares in both predator and prey as the takeover battle unfolds. The shareholders who will likely swing the vote have only been around for the blink of an eye. A large proportion of the rest are held by index funds which have to own the shares because GKN is a member of the FTSE 100. So relatively few of the people that own it really have an active, engaged interest in the long term prospects and strategy of the company. What shareholders want Is this state of affairs inevitable in a free market? Not necessarily. When Kraft Heinz launched one of the world's biggest takeover bids for Unilever last year, Unilever's chief executive Paul Polman could be found complaining that UK takeover rules pandered to the interests of shareholders over those of customers, workers, suppliers, innovation, communities and the environment. The relevant section of UK law (section 172 of the Companies Act 2006) does say that directors have to consider these groups but the law is very clear that shareholders' interests are paramount. What shareholders want, shareholders get. And in a takeover situation, many shareholders want more money now - and so the directors are obliged to deliver that by accepting a good takeover price. In the Netherlands, those wider interests hold much more legal and cultural sway and so it's harder for a corporate raider to succeed. Mr Polman, a Dutchman, has been a very vocal campaigner for exactly this brand of sustainable capitalism. Unilever has since moved from a joint Anglo-Dutch structure to a plain Dutch one. This Conservative government has sought to distance itself from its predecessors by disavowing the old Tory orthodoxy that the freewheeling Darwinism of the market is always right. When she became leader, Theresa May warned big business that the government would step in where markets failed to produce an economic model that worked for everyone. Following that script, Business Secretary Greg Clark staged a last minute intervention yesterday to show the government meant what it said and used rules forged from the painful lessons of Kraft Cadbury to demand assurances from Melrose on its future plans for GKN. He extracted a few promises but not enough to stop a large cost cutting drive and the eventual disposal of GKN's divisions as it sees fit. Radical surgery ahead Many have argued, quite reasonably, that GKN has been poorly run for a long time. Its financial health has been neglected and to thrive it needs precisely the kind of kick up the backside that Melrose will deliver. Melrose executives have said they treat the businesses they buy ""as if they were going to own them forever"" and have as good a record of investing in good assets as disposing of bad ones. But they don't own them forever and they will be looking to move on in a few years' time to a new target. It is surely true that the managements of poorly run businesses should not be protected from the attentions of well run businesses and takeovers must be part of the corporate landscape. The complicating factor in this case is that the nature of GKN's business - which include long term defence contracts - is a mismatch with an owner with such a short term investment horizon. That is certainly the view of former Defence Secretary Lord Heseltine, who intervened in several defence situations including Westland, Rolls Royce and BAE Systems. He told the BBC ""no other country would allow this to happen. The interests of the defence industry are long term, the interests of Melrose are to maximise profits over a very short period of time. Most defence contracts are joint ventures with foreign governments and foreign companies, a time horizon of five years is not even long enough to get something on the drawing board"". Whatever happens, GKN is in for radical surgery. The current management plans to sell its automotive division to a US company to raise money to return to shareholders - a plan it says was hatched before the noisy upstart Melrose arrived on the scene. One big shareholder of GKN told the BBC it thought the company was selling it too cheap and described it as ""a reactive fire sale to the Melrose approach to pacify GKN's long suffering shareholders."" Once again, the masters of the universe, and of GKN's destiny, are the asset managers. Larry Fink, the boss of the world's biggest investor, Blackrock, has nobly said more than once that companies are too focused on short-term results and not enough on creating long-term value. His firm is the largest shareholder in GKN so it will be interesting to discover whether or not it backs Melrose - the kings of the short-term turnaround.",Later we will find out whether the owner of a company with 260 years of engineering and innovation history will throw its lot in with a company that likes to run businesses for less than five.

"By Andy VerityBBC Economics correspondent The requirement loads most of the risk that the loan goes bad on the business owner, rather than the banks. It means that the banks can go after the personal property of the owner of a firm if their business goes under and they cannot afford to pay off the debt. Their main home would be protected but the bank could go after other assets. Those can include things like personal savings, shares or holiday homes. And some think that will stop business owners from making use of the emergency loan scheme, which the government put in place to stop businesses from going under during the coronavirus crisis. The coronavirus business interruption loans (CBIL) are a key plank of the government's package to protect businesses throughout the ongoing shutdown. Alex Harris owns bar Behind This Wall in Hackney, east London. He told the BBC's Today programme that he asked his bank about the government's coronavirus loan scheme, but was offered something quite different. ""The government-backed loans are from £25,000 up to £5m,"" he said. ""We got offered a financial product of theirs, another loan which is not part of the coronavirus package. ""It's for up to £24,999, but will come at up to 22% interest, which would initially bankrupt my business."" Mr Harris said he was being asked to borrow against his house and questioned why he was being asked to do so, ""faced with this level of uncertainty"". Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, advised Mr Harris to visit the website of the British Business Bank (BBB), which is overseeing the scheme, to look for another lender. He told the programme that no-one borrowing money under the government's coronavirus loan scheme would be required to use their main private residence as security. The BBB has told lenders they have discretion over the security they require. According to UK Finance, formerly the British Bankers Association, the scheme should offer loans of up to £5m, where the government promises to cover 80% of losses if the money is not repaid. But, it notes: ""Lenders may require security for the facility."" Repossess property And that could allow banks to repossess the owner's personal property as well as the assets of the business if the firm goes under. Barclays has told customers they will be required to sign personal guarantees to access the government-supported emergency finance. And HSBC told the BBC it will require a form of personal guarantee for loans over £100,000. However, Royal Bank of Scotland, which also owns NatWest, has confirmed it will offer business interruption loans without asking business owners for personal guarantees - proving that more generous terms can be offered. The other banks will now come under pressure from business customers to copy RBS. Personal guarantees allow banks to lend more because it means they are more likely to get their money back. That means they don't have to put as much money aside to cover failures, which is one of the biggest costs for a bank. But the use of personal guarantees shifts the risk from the bank and the government on to the business owner themselves. If a loan of £100,000 was made to a failed business and the owner had signed a personal guarantee, the bank would first repossess the assets of the owner or the business. Only then would the government step in to cover 80% of whatever loss remained and the bank would only have to fund whatever was left after that. Business owners and MPs say that is not fair when the firms themselves are only seeking the loans because of emergency measures introduced by the government. The SME Alliance, which represents small and medium sized enterprises and is led by business owner Andy Keats, said that while business owners were grateful for the recognition that most firms will need help to survive the crisis, ""yet again, it is the banks and not businesses who will receive the funds to help SMEs"". 'Business owners take all the risk' It said banks were seeking security - property they can repossess if the loan is not repaid - for the entire value of the business interruption loans. ""We would appreciate some clarity because, as things stand, the proposed loans mean the banks have no risk, the government has a small risk and businesses and their officers have 100% risk,"" said Mr Keats. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking tweeted: ""There is confusion about [coronavirus business interruption loan schemes]. Treasury must issue clear guidance on parameters and not allow security at 'discretion of the lender' to muddy the waters. Unprecedented times require emergency funding. Keep it simple, and no [personal guarantees]."" Kevin Hollinrake MP, a former business owner who chairs the group, said: ""I asked the chief secretary to the Treasury [Steve Barclay] in the House of Commons - does the new scheme include personal guarantees and he said it was his understanding that it would not. Well it's my understanding now that it will. ""It should not include [personal guarantees]. If it does, very few business owners are going to want to take it up. In normal business circumstances, you can't expect banks to lend money without some sort of commitment. But these are unheralded times and unprecedented measures.""",Banks have been criticised by firms and MPs for insisting on personal guarantees to issue government-backed emergency loans to business owners.
"By Padraig BeltonTechnology of Business reporter And blind and partially sighted people have been using text-to-speech converters for decades. Some think voice could soon take over from typing and clicking as the main way to interact online. But what are the challenges of moving to ""the spoken web""? What use is written online content if you can't read? That is the situation facing illiterate Ghanaian farmers denied crucial information the web offers many others. With a literacy rate in northern Ghana of only 22.6%, farmers are often ""underpaid for their produce because they might be unaware of the prevailing prices,"" says Francis Dittoh, a researcher behind Mr Meteo, a speech-based weather information service. ""The most recurring complaint is about rainfall predictions,"" says Mr Dittoh, who lives in Tamale, northern Ghana. ""They tell us the methods their forefathers used to predict the weather don't seem to work as well these days."" This is down to climate change, he believes. Yet knowing when it's going to rain is vital for farmers wanting to sow seeds, irrigate crops or graze their animals. Mr Dittoh says the idea of converting online weather reports in to speech came from the farmers themselves, after a workshop in the village of Guabuligah. ""They came up with this,"" he says. Mr Meteo takes the online weather forecast, converts it to a short recording in the appropriate language and makes it available on a basic phone. Farmers ring up to receive the information. The local language Dagbani is spoken by 1.2 million people but is not served by Google Translate. The service was designed to be cheap and easy to run, says Mr Dittoh - it works on a Raspberry Pi 2 computer with a GSM dongle. He plans to begin field tests this month, working with Tamale's Savanna Agricultural Research Institute. The spoken web could also help the one-in-five adults in Europe and the US with poor reading skills, says Anna Bon, a university researcher in Amsterdam who worked on earlier prototypes of the web-to-voice system in Mali and Burkina Faso. But building the spoken web - web-to-voice and voice-to-web - isn't straightforward. ""To understand pizza is served at Italian restaurants is easy,"" says Nils Lenke, head of research at speech recognition company Nuance. ""To cover multiple domains and to be able to have a conversation with you on every single topic, that's still far out."" So although Alexa and the others can answer simple questions about the weather and play music for us, anything resembling a wide-ranging human conversation is decades away, most experts agree. Artificial intelligence just isn't smart enough yet. Even transcribing your voice into text - automatic speech recognition - is ""one of the hardest problems to solve, as there are as many ways to pronounce things as there are people on the planet"", says Rand Hindi, Paris-based founder of speech start-up Snips. This may be an exaggeration, but the multiplicity of local dialects and accents certainly makes the task a formidable one. Web-to-voice interfaces are getting better though, says Mr Hindi. They've started to learn to handle quotation marks and the pause between titles and by-lines, and now sound a bit less robotic. Now ""they can ...emphasise boldface and whispering italics,"" he says. But digital voices need more personality to make them popular, believes Anna Bon. ""Robots are not yet witty, Siri is boring,"" she says. The benefits of using voice instead of tapping fingers obviously depends on the context. Doctors completing online forms about their patients by speech, for example, can dictate 150 words a minute, three times faster than typing on a keyboard, says Mr Lenke. This enables them to spend less time on administration and more time with patients. In 2017, Nuance helped a doctors' surgery in Dukinfield, near Manchester, set up a speech system for the practice's six doctors. Now they can dictate notes on a patient's health condition and treatment and a smart assistant automatically enters the information into the right fields on a web form. Previously, the doctors made voice recordings that were then transcribed by secretaries - a process that was costly and prone to backlogs. The new system has enabled the practice to treat four more patients a day, and letters to patients now have more detail, says practice manager Julie Pregnall. Using voice also makes sense when you're doing other things with your hands. ""Think about when you're cooking,"" says Mr Hindi, ""and you just want to know what's the next step in the recipe. Your hands are greasy, you're not going to get on the iPad, so it's a lot more natural to talk."" And speech obviously makes sense when you're driving. In the US, 29% of drivers admit they surf behind the wheel, according to insurance firm State Farm. This is up from 13% in 2009. No wonder using mobile phones while driving causes more crashes a year than drink driving, says the US National Safety Council. More Technology of Business Steven Word, from WP Engine, is the developer behind a recently launched plug-in called Polly, which lends a speech function to WordPress websites. ""In complicated written languages like Mandarin, speech might give you an advantage,"" he says. Speech is less useful in libraries, places of worship or lecture theatres, of course, so it's clear that while up to half of all searches could be voice by 2020, according to some forecasts, the web will have to be accessible by any which way we want, depending on context. But building the spoken web will be easier said than done, it seems.","We're growing more used to chatting to our computers, phones and smart speakers through voice assistants like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Google's Assistant."
"By Will SmaleBusiness reporter, BBC News Yet back in 1994 they had been invited to give a presentation to Tesco's directors. What Ms Dunn and Mr Humby said that day enabled the supermarket group to double its market share in little more than a year, transformed the way many of us shop, and ultimately made the couple multimillionaires. After they had finished their presentation, an awkward silence followed for more than a minute. This was eventually broken by Tesco's then chairman, Lord MacLaurin, who made a remark that has gone down in the supermarket's folklore: ""What scares me about this is that you know more about my customers after three months than I know after 30 years."" So what was the secret of Ms Dunn and Mr Humby's presentation? They had shown the Tesco board that their tiny business had the software and skills to do something the supermarket group hadn't been able to do for itself - work out almost exactly what Tesco's customers were buying. Ms Dunn, now 56, says: ""It was the defining moment."" Tesco quickly gave the couple a long-term contract and used their expertise to launch the Tesco Clubcard, the world's first supermarket loyalty card. Division of labour Ms Dunn and her husband had set up their business four years earlier, in the kitchen of their home in Chiswick, west London. Called Dunnhumby, it was one of the first companies in the UK dedicated to analysing data to best work out the spending patterns of consumers. Building on work the couple had previously done while both employed at the UK arm of a American software business (where they had first met and married after just one year), Ms Dunn and Mr Humby had a clear division of labour. He was the software and data expert, and she was the chief executive who would look after the day-to-day running of the business. Their first client was UK food wholesaler, Booker. Studying Booker's sales in depth, they were able to advise the company on exactly what its customers were buying, allowing Booker to improve its distribution network. Thinking about this these days, many might question why Booker wasn't already doing this itself. But back in 1990 no national retailer was properly collecting and analysing its sales data. Retailers at the time obviously knew how much they were selling of a particular product, but the key point is that they did not know what combination of items consumers were typically buying. Dunnhumby was able to provide this information. ""The thing to remember is that data was thrown away in those days... there was no such thing as data mining or data profiling, this was all new,"" says Ms Dunn. Selling data In 1994 a senior manager at Tesco got in touch with Dunnhumby because the supermarket giant wanted to launch a loyalty card. The card would give customers special offers and money-off coupons, in return for Tesco finding out a lot more about what people were buying. Only the company was having difficulty dealing with all the data. ""They were struggling with their pilot, there was just so much data that they couldn't manage it,"" says Ms Dunn. ""Remember that computers were not what they are today. ""So we were invited in to look at their data, and told not to get too excited, as it would only be one-off."" It was the start of a 16-year working relationship between Tesco and Ms Dunn and Mr Humby. Thanks to Dunnhumby's help, Tesco was able to successfully pilot its Clubcard across nine stores in 1994, and then launch it nationwide a year later. Ms Dunn explains how Dunnhumby was able to make the data work: ""We brought in a statistician's mindset, which was 'some of the data, some of the time'. That is what the technology people at the time didn't grasp."" So she says that while Tesco had been trying to analyse 100% of consumer data, a giant task that was near impossible at the time and very expensive, Dunnhumby was able to show that they could instead just study a 10% sample and still achieve between 95% and 99% accuracy. ""When Tesco asked its IT department how long, and how much to do the [nationwide] roll out, they said three years and £50m,"" says Ms Dunn. ""We said £250,000 and 10 weeks."" The launch of the Clubcard was an immediate hit with Tesco's customers, with millions of people signing up, tempted by the promise of money-off coupons, and special offers that the supermarket group had arranged with the big brand owners, such as Coca-Cola and Nestle. In just over a year it enabled Tesco to overtake Sainsbury's and become the UK's largest retailer. But how exactly did Dunnhumby make millions of pounds from its contract with Tesco? Firstly Tesco paid it an annual fee, but more importantly - and much more lucratively - Dunnhumby got a share of the money Tesco started to receive from selling to the likes of Coca-Cola the vast amount of consumer data it was now collecting. Exit plan Ms Dunn describes the start of the working relationship with Tesco as an ""amazingly intense phase"". Dunnhumby's workforce ""immediately"" went from 30 to 70, and then continued to more than double every year. ""That was the fastest we could grow, it was our maximum capacity, as we couldn't hire and train enough people,"" she says. With Tesco's blessing, Dunnhumby was soon signing similar deals with supermarket groups around the world, and then in 2002, Tesco bought a 53% stake in the business. In 2010, Ms Dunn and Mr Humby eventually sold the remainder of the business to Tesco, pocketing a widely reported £93m in total. Ms Dunn says: ""It had always been our intention to ultimately exit the business, and we had come to the end of business plan. We had exceeded our numbers, and Tesco gave us more than they had promised. ""They were happy, and we were happy. And we were tired actually... I just needed a rest."" Yet after six months of relaxation in the Caribbean and Mediterranean, Mr Humby and Ms Dunn were keen to start working again. And so a year ago, they joined a start-up business called Starcount, which aims to study which celebrities people follow on social media, and then sell on the useful information. ""Brands need to know what [and who] people really love. Only then can they introduce their brands in a way which feels relevant and personal."" Ms Dunn happily admits that Starcount is yet to make money, but earlier this year she helped it to secure multi-million pound investment. And while she doesn't comment on Tesco's recent woes - the supermarket group revealed in September that it had overstated its profit guidance - Ms Dunn says she hopes it will continue to be committed to its Clubcard.

"Last week's crash of a Boeing 737 Max was the second disaster involving the aircraft type in five months. The French BEA accident authority did not detail the similarities, but media reports suggested they found similar flight angles before the crashes. It comes amid continuing questions over 737 Max's design and vetting to fly. Regulators across the world have grounded the aircraft until further notice. In a short statement on Monday, the Paris-based BEA, whose experts have been asked by Ethiopian Airlines to examine the black boxes, said: ""During the verification process of the FDR (flight data recorder) data, clear similarities were noted by the investigation team between Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610, which will be the subject of further study during the investigation."" Both the Ethiopian Airlines flight eight days ago and a Lion Air aircraft in October crashed within minutes of take-off. In the case of the Lion Air flight, pilots had difficulties with a new system on the Boeing 737 Max which is designed to keep the plane from stalling. Questions It prevents a jet from pointing upwards at too high an angle, where it could lose its lift. But an investigation of the Lion Air flight showed the automatic anti-stalling system repeatedly forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times. Ethiopia's Transport Ministry and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have both pointed to similarities between the two disasters. US regulators and safety experts are now asking how thoroughly the FAA and Boeing vetted the anti-stall system and how well pilots around the world were trained for it when their airlines bought new planes. Over the weekend, a report in The Seattle Times claimed that some analysis before the crash found that the system, called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, revealed crucial flaws. It claims that managers at the FAA instructed its safety engineers to delegate safety assessments to Boeing and to approve the resulting analysis. The report alleges that the analysis produced by Boeing understated the power of the control system and that it could reset itself every time the pilot responded. This meant that the system could repeatedly push the nose of the plane down. The FAA said its ""aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs."" ""The 737-MAX certification program followed the FAA's standard certification process,"" it added. Boeing has been contacted for comment. The world's biggest planemaker says the 737 Max is safe, but after the Lion Air crash last year it began plans to roll out a new software upgrade. Analysis: Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent Both Ethiopia's transport minister and, now, France's air accident investigation bureau, the BEA, have said there similarities between two Boeing 737 Max crashes. So where did this information come from? Well, last week, the BEA was given the job of downloading data from the plane's black boxes - the flight data recorder (FDR) and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). This it was able to do relatively quickly. The sound files from the voice recorder - which monitors pilots' conversations and other noises within the cockpit - were sent directly to Addis Ababa, without being listened to. However, when it came to the FDR, the agency needed to make sure that the mass of data it was downloading was readable and not corrupted. It therefore brought a few basic parameters up on screen to verify them. We don't know exactly what those parameters were, but they were enough to reinforce the theory that the two aircraft suffered similar problems during flight. The Ethiopian transport ministry obviously now has all of this information - but it also has evidence gathered at the scene of the crash and satellite tracking data. The next step is to carry out a proper analysis of the contents of both flight recorders. It is impossible to say how long that will take. Nor is it clear who will carry out the analysis. Ethiopia could ask the BEA, use its own experts, or request help from another agency altogether. However, the authorities there have promised a preliminary report within 30 days. That could give a reasonable indication of what happened. It may help to show whether the aircraft was brought down by technical failures, design flaws, pilot error or a combination of all three. But the question of why it happened and who was ultimately at fault may take much longer to answer. The full investigation could take years.","Investigators examining black box recordings from the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight have found ""clear similarities"" with a previous crash."
"It said bike sales had risen 57.1% in the 13 weeks to 3 July as people sought to avoid public transport. As a retailer selling goods considered essential, Halfords did not have to cease trading because of coronavirus. However, a big fall in motoring revenues meant that quarterly same-store sales declined 6.5% overall. Halfords' share price initially fell as much as 9.5% on Tuesday before recovering some of its losses. The latest figures cover the first three months of Halfords' trading year. The retailer hailed the rise in like-for-like sales of bicycles, but said that at the same time, sales in its more profitable motoring division had fallen 45.4% as the number of car journeys declined sharply. However, Halfords said it saw ""improving trends"" as the lockdown continued to ease. ""Having responded quickly and decisively to cater for the surge in popularity of cycling during lockdown, we are now seeing increased demand for motoring services and products as people start using their cars regularly again, having not done so for the last few months,"" said chief executive Graham Stapleton. For the 2019-20 financial year, which covered the 12 months to 3 April, it reported an underlying pre-tax profit of £55.9m, down 4.9% on the previous year. Halfords said its performance in the first three months of the current financial year was ""relatively strong"" and ""better than anticipated"", but the uncertainty over coronavirus meant it had withdrawn guidance for the full year. However, the company outlined three potential scenarios for this year. In the worst-case scenario sales fall by 9.5% while in the most optimistic forecast sales decline by 5%. It also noted that its sales would remain biased towards cycling and away from motoring in the short-term, and noted that this could hit profits as the cycling business has lower profit margins. ""Halfords has proved resilient during the coronavirus crisis, unlike many non-food retailers,"" said Amy Higginbotham, retail analyst at GlobalData. ""But the retailer expects sales for its current financial year to decline 9.5% and profit before tax to be in the region of -£10m-£0m, in a worst-case scenario,"" she added, attributing the share price fall to this prediction.",Surging sales of bicycles during lockdown have cushioned the trading blow from coronavirus for retailer Halfords.
"Cyber-criminals are targeting financial institutions as Pyongyang faces tough nuclear sanctions, the Financial Security Institute (FSI) claims. Suspected hacking attempts were until recently thought to be aimed at causing disruption or accessing data. North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber-attacks. The FSI analysed cyber-attacks between 2015 and 2017. The impoverished country is now facing even tougher international sanctions aimed at stopping the flow of money that would support the development of its weapons programme. Strategy shift? Perhaps the most high profile hack linked to North Korea in recent years targeted Sony's entertainment business in 2014 - wiping out massive amounts of data and leading to the online distribution of emails, personal and sensitive employee data as well as pirated copies of new movies. However the FSI is not alone in saying there had been a shift away from this kind of disruptive, embarrassing hack, and towards cyber-attacks raising money. Cyber-hacks season: Some cyber-security firms have also connected North Korea with the global ""WannaCry"" cyber attack that affected 150 countries in May and crippled parts of Britain's National Health Service (NHS). and demanded victims pay to access data. US officials are also believed to be building a case linking last year's $81m (£62m) cyber-heist at the Bangladesh central bank to North Korean hackers. And Russian firm Kaspersky has linked North Korea to attacks on Polish banks. A report by FireEye says that North Korean cyber-operators are ""increasingly engaged in financially motivated activity"" and targeting virtual currency services. ""Actors are targeting virtual currency service providers such as exchanges and brokerage services based in South Korea,"" FireEye said. ""It is not yet clear how North Korean actors are leveraging virtual currencies, although targeting of these services demonstrates definite interest."" North Korea is also reported to be mining the virtual currency Bitcoin. FireEye said that such currencies were attractive to criminals because they could be traded in relative anonymity, compared with currencies that are managed and tracked by central banks. New hacking group The FSI report identifies eight specific instances where hackers targeted South Korean government and commercial institutions. The report also identified a hacking group named Andariel that ""has been active since at least May 2016,"" according to a translation of the document by Reuters. Andariel is believed to have tried to steal bank card information by hacking into automated teller machines to either withdraw cash or sell the data on the black market. It has also allegedly created malware to hack into online poker and other gambling sites and steal cash. The FSI was launched by the South Korean government in 2015, following attacks on major South Korean banks. This week BBC News is taking a close look at all aspects of cyber-security.

"By Robert PlummerBusiness reporter, BBC News The FTSE 100's traditional early New Year's Eve close saw it end the year down 12% at 6,728.13 points. Big European and Asian markets faced similar losses in 2018, while the main US indexes saw their worst performance since the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones ended the year down 5.6%, the wider S&P 500 fell 6.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 3.9%. US-China trade woes and slower global growth are among issues blamed for the poor showing. Analysts have also cited US political uncertainty and interest rate rises as contributing factors. As the year ended, the US was still in the grip of a government shutdown caused by President Donald Trump's determination to secure funding for a wall on the Mexican border to tackle illegal immigration. Mr Trump has also regularly rattled investors during the year by escalating his tit-for-tat trade tariff battle with China. Earlier this month, both sides agreed to suspend new tariffs to allow for talks. The president has also been at odds with the central bank, the Federal Reserve, over whether interest rates should be increased. At the same time, Europe has been rocked by political setbacks including Italy's budget row with Brussels, the waning authority of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the ""gilets jaunes"" protesters in France and, of course, Brexit. Although sizeable in historic terms, the US stock market falls were smaller in scale than those seen elsewhere, arguably in part because of the economic stimulus provided by the Trump administration's $1.5tn Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in December 2017. In Asia on Monday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed almost 14% down on the year, while the Nikkei fell almost 15% in 2018 and China's Shanghai Composite (SSE) saw a whopping 25% annual decline. In some territories, including the US, shares saw a modest upturn in thin New Year's Eve trading, boosted by optimism over the latest twist in US-Chinese trade relations. Investors drew some comfort from the latest comments by Mr Trump, who tweeted that he had had a ""long and very good call"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that a possible trade deal was making good progress. In the context of the year's overall market performance, however, it was too little, too late.",Investors will be glad to see the back of 2018 after many global stock markets suffered their worst year in a decade.
"GM has admitted it failed to alert regulators and issue a timely recall of cars that had faulty ignition switches which could cause a vehicle to accelerate. The switches were linked to 160 injuries and 84 deaths. GM filed for bankruptcy in 2009 during the height of the financial crisis. Those filing the lawsuits against GM had argued that the firm violated their rights when it failed to disclose the defect. However, GM said it was protected from those suits that were related to vehicles manufactured before it exited bankruptcy in 2009. US bankruptcy judge Robert Gerber agreed with GM, and said that the lawsuits would have to be filed against ""old GM"", which is essentially the shell company GM set up as part of its bankruptcy proceedings which contains all of the company's bad assets. GM was forced to recall nearly 2.6 million vehicles as a result of the defect, and set up a claims facility to compensate victims who could prove they suffered harm as a result of the defect. However, those suing GM were generally those who were not compensated as a result of that fund or who alleged a loss of value in their vehicle as a result of the defects. The total cost to GM as a result of the switch problems is estimated to be nearly $400m. One plaintiff's lawyer estimated the suits, if allowed to proceed, could have cost GM billions of dollars.",A judge has ruled that General Motors is protected from dozens of lawsuits over faulty ignitions switches as a result of its 2009 bankruptcy filing.
"It said it was a precautionary measure after finding a defect, in June, in one of the boilers at Heysham 1. The problem was first detected during a routine boiler inspection, which led to one of the station's two nuclear reactors being shut down. All four reactors at the stations will be shut as they are of similar design. The company said all the boilers associated with the two nuclear reactors at Heysham 1, and with the two nuclear reactors at Hartlepool, would be inspected to make sure they were safe. ""Until the results of the further inspections are known it is not possible to advise exact return to service dates for these four reactors, however, an initial estimate is that these investigations will take around eight weeks,"" said EDF. ""EDF Energy's other nuclear power stations are not affected by this issue as they are of a different design."" 'Conservative action' The company, owned by the French government, owns and runs other nuclear power stations in the UK: Hunterston and Torness in Scotland, Heysham 2 in Lancashire, Dungeness B in Kent, Hinkley Point B in Somerset and Sizewell B in Suffolk. The National Grid said the shut-downs would have no effect on the UK's supply of electricity which it said was ""fine"", helped by low seasonal demand at this time of year. ""We have many generation sources to call on and demand is low at this time of the year,"" said a spokeswoman. The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) revealed that the problem at Heysham 1 was an unexpected crack in a boiler. It said EDF would have to satisfy it that the reactors were safe to use again. ""ONR is satisfied that EDF Energy is taking appropriate and conservative action in the interests of continued nuclear safety, and that they are seeking to obtain positive confirmation of the condition of the boilers."" ""There has been no release of radioactive material and no persons have been injured,"" it added.","The electricity company EDF has temporarily shut down two of its nuclear power stations, Heysham 1 and Hartlepool."

Ms McDermott confirmed in a statement that she had interviewed for the role on a permanent basis after taking over as interim chief executive in September. In a statement released by the FCA, she said: ""I have been at the FSA/FCA for 15 years and I remain extremely committed to, and passionate about, the important work we do. It has been, and remains, a privilege to lead this organisation. ""However, going through the recruitment process has made me reflect on what I want to do with the rest of my career. ""As a result, I have decided that this is not the right job for me at this stage of my career. This was a decision taken after many months of careful thought and was not one that I took lightly. "" Since Mr Wheatley was ousted as FCA boss by the chancellor in the summer, the regulator has proposed a time limit be set on payment protection insurance (PPI) compensation claims and signalled a lighter touch approach to its regulation of the City. Mr Wheatley was originally hired as boss of the FCA because of his reputation as a tough global financial regulator. But his habit of straight talking led to accusations of banker-bashing by City grandees. Since his departure from the regulator, a major investigation into banking culture, pay and practices, was dropped. The decision to ditch the investigation into banking culture, pay and practices was not received well by MP's when it was announced last month, with the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee Andrew Tyrie calling Ms McDermott and her colleagues before his committee on 20 January. Mark Garnier MP, a Conservative member of the Treasury Select Committee, said he was ""disappointed"" by the decision. And the FCA was later forced to deny the Treasury had been involved in the decision to drop the banking inquiry. It added that a focus on the culture in financial services firms remained a priority, saying: ""We have decided that the best way to support these efforts is to engage individually with firms to encourage their delivery of cultural change, as well as supporting the other initiatives outside the FCA.""",The search for a permanent boss of the Financial Conduct Authority is expected to take a little longer after the chancellor confirmed the current interim chief executive did not want the job.
"The mid-market fashion chain will open before Christmas in Sainsbury's in Sydenham, south London, and in its new Selly Oak store in Birmingham. Sainsbury's said it hoped the move would make it a ""fashion destination"". Supermarkets, under pressure to wring more revenues out of their stores, have been expanding what they offer. Sainsbury's said three other Oasis outlets would open in other supermarkets in the spring. The supermarket group has already given over space to Argos, Clarks, Habitat and Specsavers. Rival Tesco hosts concessions from fashion brands Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Burton. Waitrose has partnered with private healthcare provider Bupa to provide in-store medical services and some Morrisons stores host Timpson shoe repair and key cutting outlets. 'Fashion destination' While Sainsbury's already sells clothes under its Tu brand, the supermarket said Oasis would complement its current ranges and ""help to make Sainsbury's a fashion destination"". Sainsbury's, which is in the process of merging with Asda, says clothing currently accounts for £1bn of its sales. Hash Ladha, chief executive designate of Oasis, said the arrangement was ""an exciting development"" for the brand, adding the two brands shared a similar customer demographic, making the tie-up ""a natural strategic partnership"". High Street fashion brands have been under pressure this year as consumers tighten belts during difficult economic times. Aurora Fashions, the firm which owns Oasis, also has fashion brands Warehouse and Coast in its stable. Coast went into administration earlier this month. Asian-inspired High Street fashion brand East collapsed at the start of the year and New Look is undergoing a restructuring involving closing 60 stores. Department stores House of Fraser and Debenhams have also run into difficulty.","Sainsbury's is opening Oasis clothes outlets in its supermarkets, the latest move to diversify the way its store space is used."
"BBC Panorama has discovered Cerberus told the government it was planning to offer homeowners better mortgage deals before its £13bn purchase of former Northern Rock mortgages in 2016. But the company hasn't provided any new mortgages and 65,000 homeowners are still trapped on high interest rates. Cerberus denies the allegation. Many of the homeowners are mortgage prisoners, who cannot shop around for a better deal because their loans are too large or their credit rating has been damaged. Trap Lisa and Mark Elkins have to pay £2,500 a month on their mortgage because their interest rate is nearly 5%. That's about three times the best market rate. They have tried to keep up with the monthly payments by taking on extra jobs and working long hours. The couple has also borrowed £20,000 from family and friends. But Lisa says they now have no choice but to sell their home of 15 years: ""I love the neighbours and I love the house but it's become a rock around my neck. You feel like you're sinking and you can't get up and I can't have that any more."" The couple has been trapped on high interest rates since the government took over Northern Rock in 2007. BBC Panorama has calculated that the high rates have cost the Elkins an additional £30,000 over the past decade. Mark tells the programme the money could have transformed their lives: ""We wouldn't have been forced into taking on loans from family and struggling. I could have a day or two days off, I could have had a weekend."" 'New deals' The Labour peer Lord McFall says that many homeowners are paying large amounts of extra interest: ""In some of the case studies I've seen, people with a mortgage would be paying an extra £40-50,000 in the mortgage before it's completed. That is totally unacceptable."" At the time of the £13bn sale, the government bank, UKAR, told Lord McFall that homeowners should get better mortgage deals from Cerberus. In a letter to the peer, UKAR said that ""by returning ownership to the private sector the option to be offered new deals, extra lending and fixed rates should become available to them"". A UKAR spokesman told the programme that Cerberus had the ability to lend to the former Northern Rock customers and that UKAR believed they intended to do so. ""The reply to Lord McFall sent on behalf of the UKAR board of directors was based on information presented to UKAR and the board had no reason to disbelieve this at that time."" 'Challenger bank' Panorama understands that the information presented to UKAR was in the pitch documents Cerberus submitted when it applied to buy the mortgages. They said they planned to ""evolve into an online challenger bank"" providing customers with ""a wider range of products"". Before the sale was finalised, however, the Financial Conduct Authority told Cerberus it couldn't offer new mortgages until it put the right systems and people in place. Nearly three years later, Cerberus still hasn't done that. The private equity firm said: ""Cerberus and our affiliates take great pride in being good corporate citizens who are committed to compliance with the strongest ethical standards and all legislative and regulatory requirements. We reject any allegations by BBC Panorama to the contrary."" Mistakes and complaints Some of the homeowners say that as well as paying high interest rates, they have also been poorly treated by Cerberus. Rachel and Adrian Neale, from Hinckley, fell into arrears on their mortgage when Rachel became seriously ill with Crohn's Disease. They have paid off most of the arrears and have kept up their monthly payments with Cerberus's mortgage company, Landmark Mortgages. But Landmark keeps making mistakes and issuing default notices. The couple say they have already made about 70 complaints and that nearly all have been upheld. ""You're in their palm basically,"" said Adrian. ""They can do what they want, that's how it makes you feel, they can pull the rug from underneath you at any time."" It can take hours on the phone to sort out the mistakes and the default notices have badly affected Adrian's building business. ""I can't take on big jobs because I can't gain credit to fund a big job. Building merchants, credit accounts, I can't get access to it and it's held me back massively really in my business."" Landmark says it is committed to high standards of fair customer treatment: ""Our staff are trained to deliver fair, consistent and right customer outcomes. Landmark promotes high conduct standards, adopting a tailored approach to customers experiencing financial hardship to ensure we find a suitable and fair solution.""

"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter The governor of the Bank of England made clear that sterling's fall ""helps the economy adjust"". However, he said it was ""going to get difficult [for those on the lowest incomes] as we move from no inflation to some inflation"". He said that food would be the first to experience price rises. More broadly, Mr Carney said goods and services would see higher inflation over the next ""few years"". ""It will show up,"" he said. Mr Carney, who was speaking at a public roundtable with charities and other third sector organisations in Nottingham, said it was not the Bank's job to target the value of sterling but that ""we are not indifferent to it, it matters to the conduct of monetary policy"". He said the Bank had to ""weigh increased inflation against supporting the economy"" with low interest rates. The pound recovered most of the days losses against the dollar following his comments. Yields on 10-year UK government bonds rose more than 10 basis points to 1.149% - their highest level since the Brexit vote - as investors bet the currency's recent falls would send inflation higher. A week after Theresa May questioned at the impact of the Bank's quantitative easing policies, Mr Carney also said that Threadneedle Street would not be told what to do by politicians. He said it made the Bank's job more difficult when politicians commented on its policies, rather than its objectives. ""We are not going to take instruction on our policies from the political side,"" the governor added. Protecting jobs Earlier, Mr Carney said that the Bank of England was willing to see an ""overshoot"" of its 2% inflation target if it meant supporting economic growth and protecting jobs. Between 400,000 and 500,000 jobs could have been at risk if the Bank had not taken action after the referendum, he said. ""We are willing to tolerate a bit of an overshoot [on inflation] to avoid unnecessary unemployment. We moved interest rates down to support the economy."" The Bank cut interest rates and provided more monetary stimulus in August after the vote to leave the European Union. Mr Carney said long-term economic prosperity could not be guaranteed by the Bank: ""We can mess it up, we can't make it. We provide the foundations, not the end."" Inequality With the fall in the value of sterling, some economists now predict that inflation will hit 3% by the end of next year as imports of products such as food and fuel become more expensive. On the issue of inequality, Mr Carney said: ""We care a lot about distribution, but we are not a political entity."" He said many people were still ""scarred"" by the financial crisis. But he argued it was for the government to decide on policies to tackle issues such as globalisation, technological change and skills education.",Mark Carney has said that inflation will rise on products such as food because of the fall in the value of the pound.
"That has spurred the bank to target $4.5bn (£3.5bn) of cost cuts by 2022 as part of a major restructuring. The bank's interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, said HSBC would scale back its headcount from 235,000 to about 200,000 over the next three years. HSBC, which makes the bulk of its revenue in Asia, reported annual profit before tax of $13.35bn (£10.3bn). It said the fall in profits was mainly due to $7.3bn in write-offs related to its investment and commercial banking operations in Europe. The 35,000 job losses are deeper than expected, and represent about 15% of the workforce. Analysts had expected about 10,000 jobs to be cut. The bank currently operates in more than 50 countries across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. It employs more than 40,000 people in the UK, where it has its headquarters. About 10,000 of those are based at its head office in Canary Wharf in London, and another 2,000 work at its new UK head office in Birmingham. HSBC has said some of the cutbacks will be in its European and US investment banking businesses, although it has not been specific about where the job cuts will fall. Are the job losses as severe as they sound? Set up in 1865 to facilitate trade between Asia and Europe, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, to give it its full name, is moving back to its roots. With most of its profits coming from Asia - and with an expectation that the region is the best bet for long term prospects - the bank's cuts will focus on its European and US operations. At present the bank is not detailing exactly where the cuts will come, but the interim boss, Noel Quinn, says reducing the workforce from the current 235,000 to ""nearer 200,000"" would be consistent with the £3bn or so he wants to save by 2022. There are four key areas that are likely to be affected: the UK investment bank, the group's central operations, the US retail banking outfit and - as in many businesses - those areas where jobs are being replaced by technology. With one in seven jobs set to go globally, employees may face an anxious time - but with HSBC seeing a turnover of 25,000 staff per year, the compulsory cuts may not be quite as brutal as they sound. Coronavirus impact Peter Hahn, banking expert and former dean of the London Institute of Banking & Finance, told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think they were too optimistic about their chances of their success in investment banking. ""The reality is that the biggest investment market in the world is the US, and if you're not big in the US in investment banking it's pretty tough to succeed in that business - and they're not."" The strategy overhaul comes as economic growth is slowing in HSBC's major markets. Asia now accounts for about half of HSBC's revenue and 90% of profits. The bank is also facing the impact of the coronavirus, the UK's protracted withdrawal from the European Union and historically low interest rates around the world. It will be the UK-based bank's third overhaul in a decade as it attempts to lift its profits. Mr Quinn told Reuters that the restructuring would mean ""that our headcount is likely to go from 235,000 to closer to 200,000 over the next three years"". The 57-year-old HSBC veteran was appointed interim chief executive in August last year following the ousting of John Flint. HSBC reiterated that it expects to make a permanent appointment within the next six to 12 months. Addressing the impact of coronavirus, HSBC said the full effect had not been fully accounted for in its latest earnings, raising the possibility that it could increase the amount it expects the outbreak to cost the bank. HSBC will also reduce the assets it owns by more than $100bn by the end of 2022 as part of sweeping reforms.","HSBC has said it will axe around 35,000 jobs as it announced profits for 2019 fell by about a third."

"The chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) told the BBC the sector would be under threat outside the single market. Mike Hawes told BBC business editor Simon Jack that the industry's success came from being in the single market. The European Union is the UK motor industry's biggest export market. Mr Hawes, who has warned on previous occasions that the industry's future growth may be hit, was speaking in Paris where he is attending the city's motor show. He said: ""Don't be blinded by the good news that you're seeing not just around our sector but around business in general. We're very concerned that the future state of the automotive industry and the success could be jeopardised if we're not in the single market."" Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor The UK car industry kicked off its own Tour de France today in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower on the sidelines of the Paris Motor Show. Vauxhall, Nissan, Jaguar, Aston Martin, Mini, Toyota and McLaren models were lined up alongside each other. However, this showroom was not for selling cars, but for issuing the auto sector's starkest warning yet. It says only continued membership of the European single market can guarantee the success of the UK car industry. The car industry is particularly sensitive to tariffs, as components and finished products can criss-cross over the Channel several times. Any additional frictional cost can throw sand in the engine of that business and its extended supply chains. Membership of the single market ensures tariff-free trade, but comes at the price of freedom of movement of people - an unacceptable outcome for most who voted Leave. UK auto's starkest warning yet He added that the growth of the industry would be under threat outside the single market ""because the success we've had and the strength of it has been built on being part of the single market"". The UK's membership of the EU's single market means it has free movement of goods, finance and people around the EU, without any tariffs or other barriers, as well as giving it a say on how the EU's rules are written. While the UK would still be able to export to the single market member countries even if it were not itself a member, it would have to negotiate trade deals, which could involve paying tariffs, customs delays and having to abide by EU rules, over which it would have no say. In the first half of the year, 57.3% of UK car exports, a total of 502,647 cars, went to the EU, followed by the US, which had 12.1% of exports. ""It's our biggest export market,"" Mr Hawes said. ""We're an export-led industry and the way that the parts move in and out of different countries, it's a highly complex process. Being part of that single market not just makes it easy but makes it affordable."" His comments were backed up by Hanno Kirner Executive Director of Corporate and Strategy at Jaguar Land Rover. ""In the worst case if we were to introduce duties, and if we were to have 10% duties to pay on parts, for instance, that would be something that customers would have to pay, it would potentially affect jobs,"" said Mr Hanno. ""Also if we export to Europe and become less competitive maybe we would sell less, we would have fewer jobs in the UK. So we are very concerned we believe that maintaining today's freedom of trade is terribly important to all of us,"" he added. No guarantees Mr Hawes was also asked if his hopes of remaining in the single market were unrealistic amid talk of UK government plans to tighten border controls. ""The challenge to the government is to ensure that industry, which creates the jobs on which so many people depend, has what it needs for its future success, but also address... concerns about immigration,"" he said. European leaders have repeatedly stressed that the UK cannot stay in the single market without accepting the free movement of EU citizens. Mark Garnier, minister at the Department for International Trade, is also attending the Paris Motor Show. Commenting on the SMMT's remarks on the need to remain in the single market, he said: ""We can't guarantee anything, but as I said, we are not going to provide a running commentary on what exit is going to look like. ""But there are elements that are within the SMMT and the automotive sector and indeed any other sector that we need to protect and in the case of the automotive sector, those things we must protect and try to achieve is zero-tariff access to this market of 500 million people in the EU,"" he added.","The success of the UK motor industry could be ""jeopardised"" if the UK leaves the single market following Brexit, a senior industry figure has said."
"Steve Easterbrook asked for the case to be dismissed in a filing at a Delaware court on Friday. McDonald's fired Mr Easterbrook last year after finding he had a consensual relationship with an employee. But last week, it alleged the British executive had lied to the board about three additional relationships. The fast food giant is suing to recover his pay-off, reportedly worth $40m (£35m), arguing it was obtained fraudulently. McDonald's bars any kind of intimate relationship between employees in a direct or indirect reporting relationship. 'Nude photos' According to reports, Mr Easterbrook's filing claims the case against him is both ""meritless"" and ""misleading"". It also accuses McDonald's of bringing its litigation in the wrong US state and wrongly making a breach of contract claim. McDonald's said it ""stands by its complaint, both the factual assertions and the court in which it was filed"". At the time of Mr Easterbrook's removal in November, McDonald's said it had evidence only of a non-physical, consensual relationship, consisting of intimate text messages and video calls. It agreed to terminate Mr Easterbrook's contract ""without cause"", fearing a protracted legal battle, according to the firm's legal filing. But after receiving a tip-off from an employee in July, the fast-food giant started a second investigation, which uncovered ""undisputable evidence"" of three other sexual relationships. It says investigators found nude photographs sent from Mr Easterbrook's company email account, as well as messages showing that he approved a grant of company shares worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to one of the employees ""shortly after their first sexual encounter"". McDonald's said that had it been aware of this information, it would not have approved his multi-million dollar pay-off. Mr Easterbrook, who grew up in Watford in the UK, led McDonald's from March 2015 to November 2019, after previously leading its UK operations. He was widely credited with revitalising the firm's stores and menus. The BBC has asked Mr Easterbrook's attorney for a comment.",The former boss of McDonald's is fighting a lawsuit brought by his ex-employer that alleges he lied about sexual relationships with staff.
"The bank looks increasingly likely to be bailed out by the government after a deadline for recapitalisation passed. The Italian parliament has authorised the government to use more than $20bn (£16.8bn) to support the bank sector. But a state bailout would mean thousands of ordinary retail investors could face losses. Monte dei Paschi failed to raise an extra €5bn (£4.25bn) from private investors by the deadline at lunchtime on Thursday and is expected to request government intervention. However the government would need to adhere to new European Union rules designed to prevent the tax payer bearing the brunt of supporting weak banks. Small investors The new Italian prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has vowed not to let the bank fail, for fear that its collapse could topple the rest of Italy's heavily indebted banking sector. Mr Gentiloni is ""stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea"", according to Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. He told the BBC's Today programme it was likely that thousands of Italian retail investors, including pensioners, would be left out of pocket, because new EU rules governing bank rescues demanded that bondholders should be the first to take a financial hit. Small investors are estimated to hold some €2bn of Monte dei Paschi's bonds. Ferdinando Giugliano, economics commentator for La Repubblica newspaper, told the BBC that this could cause controversy in Italy, since about 40,000 small investors would be affected. ""The politics is toxic. There will be a number of people who will feel defrauded by this operation,"" he said. ""Just a year ago, there was a similar case for four much smaller banks where the government stepped in... that was just 10,000 people. ""Now with Monte dei Paschi di Siena, we're talking four times as many people. A year ago, we saw widespread political discontent because of this decision. There were protests. The bank of Italy, the regulator, the government came under huge pressure. ""So we're bound to see something similar in the coming days and it will be a big challenge, particularly because in Italy we have a new government."" Analysis: Theo Leggett, Business correspondent A state bailout has been on the cards for some time - but the government has been anxious to avoid stepping in. The reason is simple. Under European laws, designed to prevent taxpayers from bearing the costs of broken banks, investors are supposed to bear some of the costs of a rescue. That's not such a problem if those investors are large investment funds with deep pockets. But in Italy, many of those left exposed would be retail investors - ordinary people, who may have put their life savings into bank bonds thinking it was a safe bet. There's a precedent - last year Italy rescued four small regional banks; 130 000, shareholders and bondholders lost their money. One elderly investor committed suicide, and there was a widespread political backlash. Monte dei Paschi is a much bigger bank, and if small investors have to bear losses, that could have much greater consequences and the political impact could be even more serious. So the question is not whether Monte dei Paschi receives a bailout; it's how that bailout is constructed, and what steps the government takes to protect or compensate ordinary investors. Stress tests As it became increasingly likely that the government would step in, Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper reported that the plan was for a rescue in several stages, although it gave no details. On Wednesday, Monte dei Paschi revealed that it could run out of funds by next April, using up nearly €11bn (£9.2bn). Previously it had said it had the funds to stay afloat for 11 months. It added that by next May, it could burn through even more - €15bn (£12.6bn) in total. Founded in 1472, Monte dei Paschi is said to be the oldest surviving bank in the world. It failed an EU stress test in July because it has billions of euros of risky loans on its books, made to clients who cannot afford to repay them. The situation has worsened since then.","Shares in Italy's third largest bank, Monte dei Paschi di Siena, closed 7.4% lower on Thursday as the markets awaited news of a rescue."
"The company's share price has surged more than 80% since its first day of public trading on 15 October, giving it a market capitalisation of nearly £6bn.

Critics say Royal Mail was undervalued by the government. Announcing its periodic rebalancing of the FTSE 100 constituents, FTSE Group said Royal Mail's promotion to the big league would take effect from Monday 23 December. One-off windfall Ashtead Group, the construction equipment company, will also join the index, while Croda International and Vedanta Resources will be bounced down to FTSE 250 index, it said. Royal Mail's flotation share price of 330p is now approaching 600p, boosted by strong investor demand for the stock. In November, Royal Mail reported pre-tax profits of £233m for the six months to 29 September, up from £94m a year earlier, excluding exceptional items. But the company said a one-off windfall resulting from a pension reform meant overall pre-tax profits were actually £1.58bn.

"Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter The Middle Eastern state of Qatar said that it was optimistic about the future of the British economy. It made it clear that the UK leaving the European Union had little bearing on its decision. Qatar has already invested £40bn in the UK - it owns Harrods and a 95% stake in the Shard in London. It also has a stake in Canary Wharf in the capital's Docklands, as well as an interest in the Milford Haven liquefied natural gas terminal in South Wales. It also bought the Olympic Village following the London 2012 Olympics. ""Currently the UK is our first investment destination and it is the largest investment destination for Qatari investors, both public and private,"" Ali Shareef al Emadi, the country's finance minister, told the BBC. ""We have more than £35bn to £40bn of investments already in the UK. ""We're announcing an additional £5bn of investment in the next three to five years. ""Mainly this investment will focus on infrastructure sectors, technology, energy and real estate."" Mr Al Emadi will join International Trade Secretary Liam Fox in Birmingham on Tuesday where UK firms will showcase projects, including in sport, cyber-security and healthcare. The government relies on foreign investment to support infrastructure projects such as the new high speed rail link between London, Birmingham and Manchester - HS2. Although no final decisions have been taken on the Qatari investments, Mr Al Emadi did not rule out putting money into HS2. ""We will look at those deals; we will look at electricity, roads, bridges, railways,"" he said. The announcement of the Qatari investment is likely to be welcomed by Number 10. It comes two days before the triggering of Article 50, the official process for leaving the European Union. Theresa May has made it clear she believes the British economy remains a positive place to invest and the Qatari announcement follows UK-focused investment decisions by Sir James Dyson, Google and Nissan. 'Confident' The decline in the value of sterling has made UK assets more attractive to overseas investors - though many economists argue that leaving the EU will damage trade with Britain's largest market and therefore damage growth. ""We always like the UK market, it has always been a good market,"" Mr Al Emadi told me. ""The way we look at our investment in any market, and especially in the UK, it is a very long term investment, so we don't look at any cycles up or down ""So if you are talking about Brexit, I can go back to the financial crisis and tell you the same stories. ""We will do what we think is good for us, it is commercially viable, it has a good vision and a good impact."" I asked him whether the UK economy outside the EU was likely to be stronger or weaker. ""It is a lot to do with the policy the UK will take, but I think, knowing the UK market, I am very confident they will have a good future,"" Mr Al Emadi answered, saying that it was important that Britain was welcoming to high skilled foreign workers and students from Qatar and elsewhere. Qatar has faced controversy over a fundraising for Barclays Bank at the time of the financial crisis and - more recently - allegations that poor labour conditions have marred the preparations for the 2022 World Cup which is being held in the country. Mr Al Emadi said that Qatar had supported job creation in the UK. ""If you look at what we have done here, it has always been a win-win situation, whatever investment we do in the UK,"" he said. ""When you talk about labour in Qatar, I think a lot of these things have been taken out of proportion and [are] inaccurate news.""","One of the largest investors in the UK has committed £5bn of new money to invest in transport, property and digital technology."
"By Katie HopeBBC News, Davos Gillian Tans is softly spoken and unassuming. The 47-year-old isn't someone you'd immediately associate with power. Yet she has a lot of it. As the chief executive of online accommodation website Booking.com she's in charge of a staggering 15,000 employees in 70 countries around the world. In 2016, she earned an impressive $17.1m (£12.3m; €13.9m). That was more than her own then boss at US firm Priceline which owns Booking.com as well as other travel related brands including Kayak and rentalcars.com. In the world of business, a successful woman on this scale is still pretty rare. In Davos for the first time, Mrs Tans says showcasing people like her can help address the imbalance. ""Role models are important."" That's exactly why the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos wants her here. It's no secret that the annual gathering of chief executives, world leaders and celebrities has a problem attracting women delegates. The attendees are still overwhelmingly men, outnumbering women by five to one despite a quota system for large firms which must bring one woman for every four men. Every year photos of the suit-heavy gathering captioned ""spot the woman"" do the rounds on social media. Of course, this largely reflects the current reality - those at the top in both business and politics are predominantly male. WEF is undoubtedly trying. For the first time in the annual conference's 48-year history all seven of the conference's co-chairs are female, yet just 21% of attendees are women, little change from last year's 20%. Criticism of Davos as a boys' club is hard to shake, and not just because of the gender inequality. Anecdotal evidence suggests that even in these refined environs female attendees may have to deal with unwanted approaches. ""Things can get tricky,"" says Mark Turrell, who is attending Davos for the 10th year in a row. The founder of business social networking application Vork says the overlap between professional work and the notorious night time parties means there can be misunderstandings. ""There is an obvious grey zone where people are not sure. People try to find out and there may be a moment that wasn't quite expected,"" he says. Mr Turrell organises an informal group of young Davos attendees to help them reduce costs by sharing lifts and accommodation. He says some single attendees bring wedding or engagement rings to reduce the odds of unwanted approaches. In reality it's not that surprising. The outpouring of stories from women using #MeToo has showed just how widespread the issue is. From an unwanted comment or touch to (at the extreme end) physical abuse or rape, the problem is everywhere. ""No matter where we look men are practising these things,"" says Gary Barker, chief executive of Promundo, which works on engaging men to end female harassment and violence. Often in the workplace, he says it may be ""subtle psychological denigration"". One solution, he says, is to use quotas to help promote more women into senior roles. ""Short term a little bit of tokenism could help. There isn't a shortage of qualified women."" WEF isn't shying away from the issue. This year's conference includes several sessions on what firms and society can do to help put a stop to sexual harassment as well as addressing the much broader issue of gender equality. On equality, WEF's evidence shows there's still a long way to go. Its latest report found that at the current rate of progress it will be another 100 years before we achieve gender parity worldwide. It's the first year since it started measuring the issue in 2006 that progress has gone backwards. But Shelley Zalis, founder of a firm which aims to advance workplace equality called The Female Quotient, believes the current heightened awareness will help. ""People are no longer accepting the status quo for the norm,"" she says. This year she has quadrupled the space of her women's networking lounge, which she sets up at major conferences each year. The space hosts talks from successful women and have attracted some heavyweight commercial partners including Unilever and Google. Normally called The Girls' Lounge, this year at Davos she's called it The Equality Lounge in recognition of the topic's pertinence - men can also attend. The location on one of the main roads leading to the conference centre means that it's impossible to miss. She describes the lounge ""as a safe place"" for women, somewhere where they can be themselves. ""A minority acting and feeling like the majority"" as she puts it. ""No one really understood it [the lounges], but now we've got a critical mass working together, understanding that their voice matters, all of a sudden we're seeing a shift,"" Ms Zalis says. This means the time is right to shake up the status quo with ""new rules"", she says. Yet the workplace solution at least isn't necessarily complicated. 'Little things' Research suggests that when firms have more women in senior roles, then more women are promoted or hired, when firms have more women in senior roles, then more women are promoted or hired. Booking.com is a case in point. Mrs Tans says more than half of its staff overall are female and they account for 20% of its tech team, typically a male dominated area. She says recruiting teams are always diverse and the firm makes sure shortlists of potential new staff or those being considered for promotion are from mixed backgrounds and sexes. It has also had an external audit to make sure the firm pays men and women equally. In the end, she says changing a lot of ""little things"" can help address the balance. ""Companies need to own this to change it. I'm not a fan of systems [quotas] but firms need to look at the data and and what they need to do to bring numbers up,"" she says. Next year, when we see whether or not Davos has more female attendees, we'll have a better idea if that has happened.","Amid the ongoing fallout from widespread sexual assault and harassment allegations and the #MeToo campaign, gender equality is high on the Davos agenda this year, but the elite annual gathering still has its own issues to solve."
"A ban on ads featuring ""harmful gender stereotypes"" or those which are likely to cause ""serious or widespread offence"" came into force in June. The first banned ad, for Philadelphia cheese, showed two fathers leaving a baby on a restaurant conveyor belt. The other, VW ad, showed men being adventurous as a woman sat by a pram. Complaints Some 128 people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about the Mondelez advert for its Philadelphia cheese which featured two dads leaving a baby on a restaurant buffet conveyor belt as they were distracted by the food. Complainants said the advertisement perpetuated a harmful stereotype by suggesting that men were incapable of caring for children and were so incompetent they would place youngsters at risk. Meanwhile, three people complained about an ad for the Volkswagen eGolf car. It showed a sleeping woman and a man in a tent on a sheer cliff face, two male astronauts floating in a space ship and a male para-athlete doing the long jump, before cutting to the final scene showing a woman sitting on a bench next to a pram. Complainants said that the ad perpetuated harmful gender stereotypes by showing men engaged in adventurous activities in contrast to a woman in a care-giving role. Jess Tye, investigations manager at the Advertising Standards Authority, told the BBC that gender stereotypes in advertising could cause ""real-world harms"". ""Ads that specifically contrast male and female stereotypes need to be handled with care,"" she said. ""It's about thinking about what the cumulative effect of those gender stereotypes might be."" 'Code breached' Mondelez UK argued that the ad showed a positive image of men with a responsible and active role in childcare in modern society. It said it chose to feature a pair of fathers to avoid a stereotype of new mothers being responsible for children. The ASA said the ad had a light-hearted and comical intent, but portrayed the men as ""somewhat hapless and inattentive, which resulted in them being unable to care for the children effectively"". It said the ad ""relied on the stereotype that men were unable to care for children as well as women, and implied that the fathers had failed to look after the children properly because of their gender"". Volkswagen UK said that its ad made no suggestion that childcare was solely associated with women, and the fact that the woman in its advertisement was calm and reading could be seen as going against the stereotypical depiction of harassed or anxious parents in advertising. The ASA said the ad presented gender stereotypes ""in a way that was likely to cause harm and therefore breached the code."" It said by juxtaposing images of men ""in extraordinary environments and carrying out adventurous activities"" with women who appeared ""passive or engaged in a stereotypical care-giving role"", the ad had suggested that stereotypical male and female roles were exclusively associated with one gender. The ASA introduced its ban two months ago because it found some portrayals could play a part in ""limiting people's potential"". The new rules cover both broadcast and non-broadcast adverts, including online and social media.",Television advertisements from US food giant Mondelez and German carmaker Volkswagen are the first to be banned under new UK gender stereotyping rules.
"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent There are certainly clouds on the horizon, but 2018 as a whole was a reasonably strong year. Global growth will probably be about 3.7% when all the numbers are in, according to the International Monetary Fund. The world's two biggest economies are likely to record respectable rates of expansion. The biggest of all, the US, had two very strong quarters in the middle of the year. Data for the final three months will come at the end of January, and while they might well show some slowing down, the whole year is likely to register pretty strong expansion of close to 3%. As for China, the slowdown after three decades of stunning growth continues. But it's still likely to be about 6.6% in 2018, which is more than enough to generate significant improvements in average living standards. Most mainstream forecasts suggest that the recovery after the great recession will continue for another year and more. So what about the clouds? Trumponomics Growth in the US is likely to be slower. The surge in 2018 reflected President Trump's tax cuts. There is some debate about whether the impact will last. Is it a one-off effect that will fade like a sugar rush, or will it have a lasting impact on incentives to work and invest? There is also the impact of the central bank, the Federal Reserve, to consider. Will it continue raising interest rates to keep inflation close to its 2% target following the four such moves it made in 2018? President Trump certainly thinks the Fed could do a lot of harm. It is, he has said, ""the only problem our economy has"". He has repeatedly made similar points, to the extent that his Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, felt the need to say publicly that the president had no desire to sack the Fed chairman Jerome Powell. (It's not clear whether he has the authority to do that, but he certainly could decline to give him another term as chairman when the current one expires in 2022, if he is still president then). In any event, the prospect of the president exerting what many would consider undue influence over the Fed has the potential to unsettle financial markets. The Fed has been given responsibility for monetary policy, which includes interest rate policy, by Congress. The mainstream view among economists is that keeping that away from the centre of the political arena is better for the long-term control of inflation. There is another strand to President Trump's economic policy that could undermine economic growth: international trade. Escalating tariffs? The US is already well into a major trade confrontation with China over what President Trump calls the theft by China of the technology of American companies doing business there. Three months into the year, the tariffs that his administration has already imposed on a wide array of Chinese goods are due to increase from 10% to 25%. China can be expected to retaliate as it did to the first round of tariffs. It is true that Presidents Trump and Xi have held some talks and it is possible that the escalation will be averted. But it is certainly not assured. And then there are the US tariffs on steel and aluminium, ostensibly imposed to protect national security, which have affected a large number of US trade partners. The prospect of continued trade tensions is a significant cloud over the economic outlook. European slowdown Europe also has its own problems. The economic data for the third quarter of the year showed a marked slowdown in growth in the eurozone. Some of this may be a very short-term stumble due to new procedures for testing vehicle emissions, which have disrupted the motor industry. But it could be the start of a more significant loss of momentum in a recovery that was never particularly strong. A survey of manufacturing industry in the region showed the slowdown continued in December with a contraction in two individual economies, Italy and France. Europe also has its own trade issue to worry about: Brexit. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March. There is a wide range of possible outcomes, some of which could disrupt trade between the UK and the continent. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Recession predictors? Stock markets had a rough ride at the end of 2018. Many recorded strong gains early in the year that were more than reversed. Overall it was the worst year for global markets (and many individual ones) since the financial crisis. Lower share prices can be a warning sign of wider economic problems ahead, sometimes even a recession. But share price falls are not a reliable sign of a coming recession. As the late Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson once joked: ""Wall Street indexes predicted nine of the last five recessions."" The market can give false alarms. The bond market, where debts including government bonds, are traded, has also been close to flashing a warning about the US outlook. A phenomenon known as the inverted yield curve has been a more reliable predictor of a downturn, though not very precise as to when. That said, there are economists who think the US may be heading for a recession, not this year but in 2020. Nouriel Roubini, who foresaw the financial crisis, is one. He also warns that the recession he predicts will be harder for the government and Federal Reserve to deal with. China also has things to worry about - in the shape of a rising burden of public and private-sector debt, which could yet undermine financial stability. Surveys of business showed that new orders for manufacturers declined in December, for the first time in two years. All things told, there are some pretty clear reasons for regarding the outlook now as a good deal harder to read and more overcast than it has been for several years.",What does 2019 have in store for the global economy?
"By Helen MillerInstitute for Fiscal Studies Their plans matter because tax underpins everything the government does. The money raised is spent on everything from schools to the NHS. So where does the UK get most of its money? And how does it compare with other countries? How much tax are people paying? The amount of money the UK government collects through taxes is at a historical high. UK tax revenues as a share of national income - the total amount of money the country earns - are at their highest sustained level since the 1940s. The taxes that many of us are most aware of are income tax and National Insurance contributions (NICs). These are the sums of money on a payslip that never reach our bank account, along with pension contributions or student loan repayments. Together, they account for the majority of revenue collected in the UK. How much tax is deducted from your income depends on how much you earn. Those on higher salaries pay a higher share of their income in tax. An employee earning £28,000 - a middle income earner in the UK - will pay nearly £6,000 in income tax and NICs. On top of this, their employer has to pay nearly £3,000 in employer NICs. Overall, that means that about 28% of the cost of employing them ends up in the hands of the government. Half of the cost of employing someone on £340,000 - 10 times higher than the average full-time UK employee - goes on tax. What's it like in other countries? The UK is in the middle of the pack when it comes to how much tax it raises overall. But many other European countries have much higher taxes on workers' salaries. For example, if the UK imported the French tax system, not 28% but 48% of the cost of employing someone on £28,000 would be paid in tax. That's a big difference - £10,000 extra for the government. The average rate for the higher earner would increase from 51% to 67% if the UK imported the Belgian tax system. That would be an extra £91,000 in tax revenue per person. The countries that raise more in tax than the UK almost all do this by raising more from income tax and social security contributions. Compared with European countries, the UK stands out most in its relatively light taxation of middle earners' incomes. Rates for high earners are closer to those seen elsewhere. If the UK imported the tax system of another European country that raises more tax, average rates would increase for high earners but middle earners would be the most affected. What other taxes does the government collect? The amount the UK raises from other taxes is similar to that of other developed countries. For example, VAT - the 20% tax charged when we buy many goods and services - is close to levels seen elsewhere. The same goes for corporation tax - the 19% charged on businesses' profits. Income tax, social security contributions and VAT between them bring in most revenue in all developed countries. They typically account for more than 70% of total government income from taxes. But similarities in the amounts raised by certain taxes can mask important differences in who is paying them. In the UK, zero VAT is charged on many items, including food and children's clothes. Together, zero and reduced rates of VAT cost the government £57bn each year. More like this This approach is intended to help those on lower incomes. However, because richer households spend most on these items, they benefit more. An alternative approach could be to apply the full 20% VAT rate to a wider range of goods, to raise more money. This could be used to fund benefits or income tax cuts for those who are less well-off. Careful choices Whether the UK chooses to have higher or lower taxes matters for the level and quality of public services the government provides. There is a lot to think about in the run-up to a general election. For example, pressures will continue to grow on the NHS, largely because of our ageing population. That will make health and social care more expensive. It is likely that we will need higher taxes in future if we want to maintain the quality of public services. But how we raise tax can be just as important as how much we raise. Whatever choices we make, we need to keep one important thing in mind - who's paying?

"A warning notice on the country's customs administration website listed 81 items imported by companies including Nike, H&M and Zara. In March, China targeted foreign clothes retailers as an international backlash grows over claims of abuses in the cotton-growing Xinjiang region. Earlier this year, several Western nations imposed sanctions on China. The announcement from China's General Administration of Customs included items like children's clothing, shoes, toys, toothbrushes and baby bottles that were spotted during examinations from June 2020 to May 2021. Nine batches of H&M girls' cotton dresses were said to contain ""dyes or harmful substances [that] may be absorbed by the body through the skin, mouth, etc. and endanger health."" The same issue was raised for children's clothes imported by Zara, Nike boys' t-shirts and batches of Gap boys' cotton pyjamas. H&M, Zara, Nike and Gap have not yet responded to requests for comment from the BBC. The notice is the latest blow to Western clothing brands operating in China, which have been targeted amid an international backlash over claims of abuses in the cotton-growing Xinjiang region, home to the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group Several big companies have expressed concern over allegations that Uighurs are being used as forced labour. Some firms' online shops have been blocked and their stores have vanished from some digital maps. China initially targeted H&M and Nike but that has widened to include Burberry, Adidas and Converse, among others. While H&M's physical stores in China remain, it is no longer possible to hail a taxi to the shops using an app and consumers can't shop online. Instead China is championing local brands. In March, several Western countries imposed sanctions on officials in China over rights abuses against the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group. China has detained Uighurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. The sanctions were introduced as a coordinated effort by the European Union, UK, US and Canada. Beijing has denied the allegations of abuse, saying the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism. China has also hit back with retaliatory sanctions on Western lawmakers, scholars and institutions.

"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent He often focused on particular US trade partners. Mexico and China were most frequently in his sights. And one of his first actions as president was to withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a regional trade deal, agreed by his predecessor but which had not come into force. So what are President Trump's priorities for trade? What does he hope to achieve? He often focuses on trade imbalances: the US deficit in trade with the rest of the world and bilateral deficits too. Here are some figures. Last year the US had a deficit of half a trillion dollars in trade in goods and services with the rest of the world. For China, the bilateral deficit was close to $350bn (£280bn). For Japan, Germany and Mexico, the figures were in the range of $60-70bn. President Trump considers these figures to be evidence that the US has done badly, that it has been treated unfairly. Mexico, he has said, is ""killing us on jobs and trade"". He has expressed similar views on China: ""We are like the piggy bank that's being robbed."" His trade adviser Peter Navarro told the Financial Times that Germany uses a grossly undervalued euro to exploit its trade partners, essentially arguing that the exchange rate gives Germany a competitive advantage that's unfair. Mr Trump has also criticised Japan for barriers to American car exports and for manipulating its currency to gain a competitive advantage. He wants to see a reversal of the decline in manufacturing employment that the US has experienced. (The number of jobs in manufacturing dropped sharply in the 2000s, though the share of total employment has been falling for decades.) So where do those concerns lead President Trump's trade agenda? Rolling over? His bilateral discussions have got off to a somewhat gentler start than his campaign language might have led us to expect. He held a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping last weekend. They agreed a 100-day programme of talks. The US expects China to offer better access to its market, including for beef and services companies. Mr Trump's campaign language about possibly imposing large tariffs on imports from China, as much as 45%, was not on display this time. One China critic in the US, Gordon Chang, asked: ""Did Trump just roll over on China trade?"" And just days after meeting President Xi, Mr Trump said his administration would not label China a currency manipulator, rowing back on a campaign promise. China's critics have a wide-ranging list of allegations about unfair practices - subsidies to Chinese industries, dumping underpriced goods, and the theft of patents and copyright. With Mexico, President Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a deal that dramatically reduced barriers to commerce between the US, Mexico and also Canada. Most goods are traded free of tariffs (taxes applied only to traded goods). He has said that Nafta was the worst trade deal the US has ever done, that it kills American jobs. How would he like to change it? He has threatened a number of carmakers with ""border taxes"" (that is tariffs) if they expand production in Mexico for export to the US market. That would be inconsistent with Nafta as it currently stands and it's hard to see how it would comply with any amendments to Nafta that the Mexican government would be willing to accept. It's also almost certain that such action would be incompatible with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Revise, not scrap But there are signs that the administration's approach may in the event be softer. There is a draft letter from the administration to Congress setting out objectives for a renegotiation. National Public Radio described the proposed changes as ""tweaks"". There is quite a long list of areas proposed for revision, including a right to re-impose tariffs (probably temporarily) in response to a surge in imports and an effort to remove barriers to US exports to the other two countries. There is also a call to look at what are called ""rules of origin"", which specify how much of a product's value has to be added in the Nafta area to qualify for tariff-free treatment. A higher threshold could make it harder to use components made in China, for example. But what is clear is that this is about revising rather than scrapping Nafta. It's also unclear exactly what Mr Trump would do about disputes in trade with other countries. Options include making more aggressive use of the WTO's rules for disputes. There is its judicial dispute settlement system, and there are actions that countries can take unilaterally against subsidised or dumped imports (sold abroad more cheaply than in the producer's home market), provided they do it in a way that is set out in WTO rules. Anxiety What worries many trade experts is that the Trump administration might be ready to bypass WTO rules and impose new barriers to imports regardless of the organisation's rules. It would be a very serious, possibly fatal blow for the credibility of the agency if the world's largest economy were not to take it and its rules seriously. The WTO is at the heart of a system of international trade relations, based on rules that started to take shape soon after World War Two. Although the WTO itself wasn't established until 1995, much of the rulebook that it now manages goes back to the late 1940s. There is a lot of anxiety among trade officials about just how the global trade system might unravel if the WTO were seriously undermined. The concern is that there could be widespread new restrictions arising and their view - shared by the great majority of economists - is that increased trade protectionism would be bad for living standards around the world. It certainly caused a lot of anxiety when a recent meeting of finance ministers from the G20 leading economies dropped from its communique a remark that had previously been routinely included about avoiding trade protectionism, something that was done at the insistence of the US delegation. So we certainly have some new questions about what role the US will take in shaping the future of the global trading system. President Trump's most strident campaign comments haven't yet been fully reflected in the actions of his administration, with the exception perhaps of the withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But it is still very early days.",Trade was one of the dominant themes in Donald Trump's election campaign.
"Money Talk by Martin EdwardsMace & Jones It has also suggested employees should more often be forced to pay a financial deposit before making a claim. This will please employers who say too many time-wasting claims are made by sacked staff who have nothing to lose. But the new proposals have a sting in the tail for employers. Tribunals are likely to be given power to impose an additional fine if a case is lost, payable to the government, on top of the employee's compensation. The government also plans to seek a contribution from users of the tribunal service to the cost of running it. Successive governments have legislated to try to reduce frivolous employment claims, and to encourage managers and their staff to resolve their disputes without recourse to the tribunal system. For instance, in 2004 Labour introduced statutory procedures for the handling of grievances and dismissals. They were supposed to be simple, but the element of compulsion, coupled with fines for non-compliance, had the effect of increasing the number of claims, not reducing them. An embarrassed government repealed the rules in 2009. Prompt action If the proposals come into force, both employers and employees will have even greater incentives to deal sensibly with claims. So what, in practical terms, should they do? First and foremost, they should deal with issues promptly. This means no unnecessary delay in holding meetings, reaching decisions or confirming outcomes of meetings. They should also behave consistently. So an employer who sacks a person for an offence which, in a previous case, had only merited a warning will find the inconsistency hard to justify. Employees who change their stories during the course of a disciplinary investigation are also likely to run into trouble. Employers should comply with the Acas guidelines on good employment practice. They need to have clear written procedures that their managers follow and their staff understand. I once met an employer who said he made staff redundant ""as a punishment"" - needless to say, his defence against claims of unfair redundancy was bound to fail. 'Costly mistake' A manager dealing with apparent misconduct, poor performance or unacceptable absence needs to investigate the facts thoroughly, but speedily. The type of investigation required varies, depending on the situation. Where there has been misconduct, witnesses need to be interviewed, and where an employee is off sick for an unacceptably long time, the medical explanation ought to be carefully examined. Employers should beware of jumping to conclusions or taking things for granted. Natural justice demands that employees should have a chance to put their side of the story before any adverse decision is taken. This is true in a case of redundancy just as much as where there is an allegation of gross misconduct. Failure to consult redundancy candidates adequately, before dismissal notices are given, is a common and costly mistake. A classic example of how not to do it occurred in 2003 when the UK's largest personal injury claims firm, Accident Group, sacked more than 2,000 staff, mainly by text message. If the company had not collapsed, the exposure to compensation claims would have been massive. Rubber stamp? From an employee's perspective, it is vital to take advantage of the opportunity to put your case while still employed. This means preparing carefully before important meetings and mentioning anything relevant that might persuade the employer not to dismiss you or give you a warning. Employees have a legal right to be accompanied by a colleague or trade union representative at disciplinary and grievance hearings and it makes sense to take advantage of this right. In some serious cases, for instance where your whole livelihood is threatened, or you are at risk of deportation, you may have a right to be accompanied by a solicitor, even if your employer's procedures do not normally allow it. An employer should offer an employee a right of appeal against dismissal, and an employee who is aggrieved by the decision should appeal, rather than assuming that it is a waste of time. Good employers will not treat an appeal as a mere rubber-stamping exercise. Keeping notes Often, managers and employees involved in a tribunal case fail to document accurately all the relevant facts. This can prove disastrous, as memory is fallible. When interviewing witnesses, I find that each person, however honest, has a slightly different recollection of events. Just as employers need clear minutes of grievance, dismissal, and appeal hearings, so employees need to keep a record of unpleasant behaviour (such as bullying) which drive them to leave the job and claim constructive unfair dismissal. Process is very important in employment tribunal cases, and employers who do not get their procedures right will incur even higher costs under the new proposals than they do at the moment. Equally, employees who fail to comply with disciplinary warnings will find that their jobs are seriously at risk. More complications Unfortunately, the law of unintended consequences is as powerful as anything on the statute book. The government's proposed changes may only keep a minority of claimants out of the tribunal, and those people may find other ways to make a claim. So it may be that unfairly dismissed employees with less than two years' service may become tempted to claim that they are whistleblowers, or victims of discrimination. These sorts of claims do not require any qualifying service at all, and can be time-consuming and complicated to resolve.

"By David SilverbergBusiness reporter Pennsylvania bank boss John Spier was fed up with looking like a ""stuffy banker"". So after decades of wearing loose-fitting pinstripe suits and anonymous ties, he decided he wanted a fashion makeover. Taking a leap of faith, Mr Spier enlisted the help of a corporate stylist Toi Sweeney. Overnight his old wardrobe was binned, to be replaced with ""warmer ties and a more fitted suit"", says Mr Spier. ""She was able to preserve the professional look I wanted without making me seem like a stuffy banker."" Mr Spier says he went from an executive who rarely thought about what he was going to wear, to someone who likes wearing colourful ties. More importantly, he says the makeover has put a spring in his step, and made him more confident. The saying, ""you never get a second chance to make a first impression"" perhaps resonates most in the workplace, where bosses must exude authority but also friendliness, and the rest of us want to look professional, but stand out. Ms Sweeney believes ""we are all products and your personal brand steps through the door before you do"". She may have a point. According to research from Princeton University, when we see a new face, our brains decide whether a person is attractive and trustworthy within a tenth of a second. Ms Sweeney says that the colours you wear also have a big impact on how others quickly perceive you. For example, she says red is a powerful colour that implies confidence and leadership qualities. Whereas, blue apparently connotes a warmer approach, since ""it's the colour of trust and being a peacemaker"". And black can suggest authority and sophistication, but Ms Sweeney advises that it should be mixed up with a splash of colour. She recommends a bright handkerchief in a suit pocket for men, or a colourful handbag for women, so as the person can stand out from the crowd. Meanwhile, the colour brown should also not be discounted since it often suggests that the wearer is reliable. ""Ever wonder why United Parcel Service workers only wear brown?"" says Ms Sweeney. Kara Kuryllowicz, a 57-year-old corporate writer based in Toronto, hired a stylist last year to help modernise her look. ""I thought everything I owned was fine, but she came to my place and went through my closet and threw out 80% of my clothes,"" she remembers. Ms Kuryllowicz says she had ""a long-time love affair with black and white, but now I'm wearing more colours"". ""Now I'm [also] wearing more jewellery with colour, and I feel really comfortable wearing it."" Her new colourful look makes her feel more ""professional and confident"" and has helped her to win more work, she says. While the cynical might question whether wearing a certain colour to work can really make a difference, a number of studies have actually shown that it can affect how we feel. In a report published earlier this year in the European Journal of Social Psychology, participants who wore red reported feeling more physically attractive and sexually receptive than those who wore blue. Also, in a study published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, subjects who donned white coats that they thought belonged to doctors did better on tests than those who wore casual clothes, or those who thought the coats belonged to artists. ""What you're wearing affects your mood and builds your confidence. It's worth it to always dress a little better than those around you,"" says Toi Sweeney. Someone who knows about dressing better, is Kim Winser, a former chief executive of the UK fashion brands Aquascutum and Pringle of Scotland.

"By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent The country's national statistics office said that most sectors of the economy were ""markedly affected"" by the health emergency. It was a sharp decline, although many economists had expected the contraction to be even worse. The contraction was also less pronounced than the downturn in 2009 caused by the global financial crisis. When adjusted for the number of working days (there were more last year than in 2019), the decline in GDP was somewhat deeper at 5.3%,, although that is still not as pronounced as in 2009. That said, it was described by Andrew Kenningham, of London-based consultancy Capital Economics, as a ""huge slump"". There were severe falls in household spending (6%) and in investment in machinery and equipment (12.5%). Germany is a leading exporter, in particular of manufactured goods, and sales abroad fell by 10%. Those declines were partly offset by an increase in construction. There was also an increase in government spending, as Berlin sought to limit the extent of the economic damage. Recovery Germany has experienced a recent increase in Covid cases and there are associated restrictions in place. Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned they could be in place for another eight to 10 weeks. The health situation and the government response to it are sure to affect the economy. Mr Kenningham said it was likely to decline again in the current quarter. Looking further ahead, however, economists expect vaccines will support a recovery in Germany and the rest of the world. Germany was less affected in the early stages of the pandemic than many other developed countries and that has probably helped to moderate the economic consequences of the health crisis. Many of the other developed economies which were more affected in public health terms - including the UK, France, Italy and Spain - are likely to report significantly deeper contractions for 2020 when figures are published in the coming weeks.","The German economy shrank by 5% last year as the Covid-19 pandemic took its toll, according to official figures."
"By Peter BowesBBC News, Los Angeles We wanted to know how experts suggest we turn rejection around so that it helps a job search be successful in the long run. ""Don't take rejection personally,"" says Los Angeles-based business coach Joanna Garzilli. ""Often there are a number of factors at play including timing, circumstances, office politics and budgets. Just because someone says no today doesn't mean it's a no in the future."" And About.com job-search expert Alison Doyle says: ""The best way to deal with rejection is to consider why you were rejected, and then move on."" Feedback But analysing rejection is easier said than done. It may be tempting to follow up a rejection email or letter by asking an employer how they reached their decision, but you won't always get a response. ""Many employers won't disclose any information to applicants they rejected, because they are concerned about legal issues like discrimination,"" says Ms Doyle. ""That said, it can't hurt to ask, and if you do get feedback, consider how you can use it enhance your chances in the future."" If you can't get feedback, you should spend some time asking yourself what might have gone wrong. Ms Garzilli says: ""Do a self evaluation on what went well, what didn't and why? This will help you to be well prepared for the next job interview."" Re-focus In the relatively anonymous world of online job searching, where the number of applications and rejections can mount up very quickly, it it easy to lose focus on the ultimate goal. Ms Doyle says: ""Do consider how effective your job search is - or isn't. ""Are you applying for the right jobs? Jobs that are a strong match for your qualifications? If not, you are wasting time because there are so many applicants for each position, only the most qualified candidates will be considered."" 'Disappointing, disillusioning and discouraging' Since May, Sheri Bennett, from California, has applied for more than 200 jobs online, but she is still looking for work. ""I have not had many call-backs at all, and a lot of the companies don't even send a courtesy email that you've not been selected,"" she says. ""Not even an acknowledgment, not even a thank you for applying. Nothing."" The former teacher says it can be very ""disappointing"" and ""disillusioning."" Emotional toll Ms Bennett, who says she is ""discouraged"" at times, responds by simply ""trying harder."" Dan Sparks, vice-president of sales at Hire Live, which stages career fairs, says: ""There are very qualified candidates out there and sometimes it just takes a little time to find that right position. says . ""Don't just talk to one company and say, 'That was it, that's all I need to do, I already got that job.' Keep an open mind, don't be disappointed if they say no or don't be disappointed if they move forward with somebody else."" Being out of work for a prolonged period takes its toll emotionally. Relationships suffer, and unsuccessful candidates can find themselves on a downwards spiral into depression. Ms Doyle says: ""One way many job seekers have dealt with lethargy or depression is to not focus all their time and energy on job seeking. ""Spending time volunteering, for example, will help you feel better about yourself. It may also help you make valuable contacts who can help your job search.""","Technology has made firing off multiple job applications easier - but as well as more opportunities for success, there is also more chance of rejection."
"The British Retail Consortium and Usdaw's advice includes providing hand sanitiser for customers. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's boss, said: ""The safety and wellbeing of retail colleagues and customers remains the highest priority."" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday that ""careful steps"" will be needed when easing the lockdown. The industry body and the union issued the advice to non-food retailers, closely based on what is already happening in many food stores. Some suggestions include: Shops that were deemed ""non-essential"" have been shut since the government set out strict new measures to tackle the spread of coronavirus on 23 March. Those allowed to trade under lockdown include supermarkets, pharmacies, newsagents and post offices. Usdaw general secretary Paddy Lillis said that ""Non-food retail should only start trading again when expert public health advice agrees. ""However, we need to be ready and we need to make sure that the proper preparations and measures are put in place."" Companies that had temporarily shut stores are starting to reopen amid lockdown measures, after introducing new social distancing controls. DIY chain Homebase reopened 20 of its UK stores for a trial period on Saturday, following the lead of its competitor B&Q. Hardware shops were included on the government's list of essential retailers that were allowed to trade under the restrictions and Homebase customers could continue to shop online. The boss of UK shoe repair firm Timpson, James Timpson, said on social media that it will reopen 40 of its outlets based in supermarkets, which are classified as essential retailers, next week. Beyond the retail sector, low cost airline Wizz Air has also announced plans to restart some flights from Luton Airport from 1 May, although the Foreign Office is still advising against all but essential journeys. The company is introducing what it calls ""enhanced"" health and safety measures. Cabin crew will wear masks and gloves, while passengers will be given sanitising wipes. The airline also said it would introduce distancing measures, but did not give any further details. Several housebuilders such as Taylor Wimpey and Vistry have also announced they will return to work in May. Taylor Wimpey plans to restart work on most of its building sites across England and Wales next month. Its staff will follow new safety guidelines, while subcontractor work will resume afterwards. Vistry - formerly Bovis Homes - announced construction would resume on most of its ""partnership sites"", which are typically affordable housing projects, from Monday. The firm added that a ""significant"" number of private housing construction sites would also reopen.",Trade figures have issued new social distancing guidelines for shops to prepare for any easing of the lockdown.
"By Emma WoollacottTechnology of Business reporter He heads a team of researchers trying to capture more of that free energy. While solar panels have made big advances in recent years, becoming cheaper and more efficient, they just provide electricity, not storable liquid fuels, which are still in great demand. ""If you look at the global energy portfolio and what's needed, electricity only covers maybe 20-25%. So the question is when we have covered that 25%, what do we do next?"" asks Prof Reisner. His answer is to look to nature: ""Plants are a huge inspiration, because they have learned over millions of years how to take up sunlight and store the energy in energy carriers. ""I really believe that artificial photosynthesis will be one part of that energy portfolio over the next two decades."" When plants photosynthesise, they take up water and carbon dioxide, and use light from the sun to convert these raw materials into the carbohydrates they need for growth. ""We want to replicate this, but we don't really want to make carbohydrates because they make a lousy fuel, so instead of making carbohydrates we try to make something that can be more readily used,"" says Prof Reisner. An added problem is that plants aren't actually terribly good at photosynthesis, converting only around one or two per cent of solar energy into fuel. The US Department of Energy has concluded that for artificial photosynthesis to be viable economically, efficiency needs to rise to between five and 10%. Prof Reisner's team has worked on a number of approaches, including a system that mimics natural photosynthesis, using enzymes to split water and create hydrogen for fuel. More Technology of Business However, efficiency is still low and, as a gas, hydrogen is difficult to store. Perhaps more promising in the long term is his team's recent development of a small device that converts sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and formic acid, a liquid fuel that has a high energy density. The device contains a panel which sits in a bath of water and carbon dioxide. Under sunlight the panel releases electrons which combine with the carbon dioxide and the protons in the water to make formic acid. ""These systems are like panels or sheets. It's a very thin device - you can almost think of it as like a sheet of paper,"" says Prof Reisner. Perhaps the biggest step forward with the device is the fact that it is standalone. It doesn't require an external power source, nor any top-ups of additional catalysts. Despite the challenges artificial photosynthesis is attracting heavyweight investment. In the US, the Department of Energy recently announced funding of $100m (£76m) over five years. The money is going to two separate projects: the Center for Hybrid Approaches in Solar Energy to Liquid Fuels (Chase) and the Liquid Sunlight Alliance (Lisa). Chase, led by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), is working on practical applications similar to the Cambridge device by developing systems that, like solar panels, use semiconductors to absorb light, and then use various different catalysts to convert the carbon dioxide to fuel. A particular focus of research, says Chase deputy director Prof Jillian Dempsey, is the concept of cascade catalysts. Turning carbon dioxide into a usable fuel involves making more than one chemical transformation - and catalysts can handle only one at a time. ""The first one does the first step, and then passes its product off to the next catalyst,"" she says. ""Each one would be operating a very highly selective process, and handing off after that individual step to the partner down the road."" The Lisa project is taking a more theoretical approach, focused on improving every stage and component of artificial photosynthesis. Potential catalysts and processes are modelled by computer before they're tried out. ""We have a vigorous theory effort, and the theory and the experiment go hand in hand,"" says project leader, Prof Harry Atwater of Caltech. ""We now have what's actually the world's largest database, full stop."" The bad news is that we're not likely to see fields full of photosynthesis panels any time soon. According to Prof Dempsey, there are still major stumbling blocks. Bringing together all the technology into one bundle is a problem. ""There's been some incredible science in terms of light harvesting, in terms of the catalysis that makes the fuel and in terms of managing systems,"" she says. ""But the integration of these individual components into a system capable of artificial photosynthesis is a huge challenge."" It's also difficult to ensure that the reactions produce a commercially-viable fuel, with many of the catalysts that can achieve this being too expensive or too inefficient for large-scale use. Finally, says Prof Dempsey, durability is a problem: ""When you're dealing with constant radiation [sunlight] that can cause a reaction that can be highly detrimental and corrosive."" As a result, artificial photosynthesis still can't produce liquid fuel cheaply enough to compete with fossil fuels. ""But the dynamic can change very quickly,"" says Prof Reisner. ""The oil price can change, taxation can change. And when things start shifting, at some point in the future the price of artificial photosynthesis will go down and the price of fossil fuels will go up. The question is just when these lines cross. ""If you go back 10 years, even the most optimistic predictions for the cost of photovoltaic-derived electricity did not match what happened. The cost came down by 85%, which is incredible. Once economy of scale comes in, a lot is possible. So I'm very optimistic.""","The sun produces more than enough energy for human activities, but we still can't capture enough of it, points out Erwin Reisner, energy and sustainability professor at Cambridge University."
"Love Island is currently the most watched programme for adults aged 16-34 in the UK, across any channel. The latest season saw a new record of more than 6 million viewers tune in across TV and devices. ""Off the back of a record-breaking year, we're delighted to be bringing an extra series.... to the 2020 schedule,"" said ITV's Paul Mortimer. ""Love Island has proven yet again to be the perfect format that engages younger audiences,"" the firm's head of digital channels and acquisitions added. ""In response to this viewer appetite, a new batch of young singletons will deliver some highly anticipated post-Christmas romance and drama from our new and luxurious location."" Next year, Love Island will host a second series of the year in a new winter location - a brand new villa in South Africa. But profits and advertising have fallen, as the broadcaster reeled from an ""uncertain economic and political environment"". Pre-tax profits at ITV fell 16% to £222m from £265m in the same period in the previous year, while revenues dropped 7% to £1.4bn. Advertising sales slid 5% to £849m from £890m, in 2018. However, its shares were up by 6% in morning trade in London, at 112.72 pence. How does Love Island make money? Analysis: BBC Business reporter Mary-Ann Russon Love Island is not merely a reality TV show - fans flock to its online shop, where you can buy everything from personalised water bottles and suitcases, to special make-up collections designed just for Love Island's audience. The show also has its own companion app, where users can take part in quizzes and access exclusive content such as podcasts and videos, vote for their favourite contestants, and even shop for the latest look. In an unusual move, fashion retailers need to pitch ITV before each new series of Love Island in order to win the coveted job of providing the contestants with wardrobes for the latest season. On top of having millions of viewers see the retailer's latest collections, direct links to clothing items on the retailer's website are featured within the Love Island app in its Style section. This year's official fashion partner is I Saw It First, which recently told Drapers fashion industry magazine that its sales jumped 67% month-on-month since Love Island series 5 began airing on 3 June. I Saw It First said that it had seen a 60% increase in traffic to its website, with spikes in site visits occurring on Monday nights after 9pm when the show airs on ITV2. According to Monterosa, which developed the Love Island mobile app, as of July 2018 - by the end of the fourth series - the app had more than 3.5 million users and had generated sales of in excess of £5m. ""The Love Island App... has more active users than other apps like Uber, Deliveroo, BBC News, Asos, Amex, and British Airways,"" mobile technology marketing experts Ogury Research wrote in its Mobile Marketing July 2018 report. Ogury told the BBC that the Love Island app is performing even better now than it did in summer 2018. Last year, the Love Island app ranked 29th in the Entertainment category in Ogury's mobile information platform, which analyses apps in the iOS and Android app stores. Now, the app is ranked 26th. Love Island is franchised overseas and currently airing in Australia, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Sweden. In the US, CBS has bought the rights to the show, which just began airing its first series on 9 July. Mental health concerns In May, ITV cancelled the Jeremy Kyle Show after the death of a participant who had reportedly failed a lie detector test. And there has been some controversy around Love Island after two former contestants died in 2017 and 2018. When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether Love Island should be cancelled too, ITV's chief executive Carolyn McCall disagreed. She said that the circumstances surrounding the Jeremy Kyle Show were completely different to those around Love Island. ""Mind and the Samaritans tell the public constantly not to simplify links, and I'm afraid that's what media does,"" she said. ""The two contestants, who were really popular contestants - Sophie and Mike - there was nearly a two-year gap for each of them and they did lots and lots of other things after Love Island, so I think it's a strange thing... to bring up to be honest."" 'Real world' She defended ITV's decision to offer contestants counselling after they leave the show: ""We offer that because we think it is important if you come out of a villa after eight weeks - you were living a very different life and you're now coming out into the real world. ""And adjusting to that real world can be quite difficult to some people, and that's why we offer counselling or therapy."" Ms McCall said she watches the show every night and felt that Love Island does offer the public value. ""The thing about Love Island is that it's a dating show. If you watch it, it is entertaining, but it is also about the every-day ups and downs of relationships,"" she said. ""They are also very kind and supportive and they discuss a lot of issues that a lot of people value because they are issues that happen in modern-day relationships.""","ITV has announced that one of its top shows, Love Island, is moving to two series a year in 2020."
"""A lot of people are going be nervous about coming out. We've all got to do our jobs in making people feel confident, making them feel safe, but also giving them that experience that hospitality is."" Restaurants and pubs across the UK have been hard-hit by lockdown measures that were introduced in March in an attempt to stop the spread of the coronavirus. In England, the hospitality industry expects to be allowed to reopen from 4 July, although there's no firm date yet for Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. But Mr Selby does not expect consumer confidence to return overnight. ""The reality is that people are not going to come back in their droves, they're going to slowly build back that confidence,"" he says. Wahaca typically serves about 60,000 diners each week. But the restaurant chain expects that once it has reopened, sales will initially be down by about 60%, before slowly coming back up over the course of the next year. Coronavirus measures Like other British restaurant chains and retailers, Wahaca is considering a number of measures in a bid to keep staff and workers safe amid the pandemic. Mark says customers could be given the option of ordering food on apps. Other safety measures are likely to include having staff wash their hands every 20 minutes - once its 28 UK outlets have reopened. And although Wahaca is keen to make things work in a newly socially-distanced world, Mr Selby expects the restaurant chain to struggle, if social distancing guidelines are not relaxed at least somewhat. ""I don't see how anyone makes money on two-metre guidance, it becomes an impossible situation to work to,"" he says. Other countries use lower numbers for social distancing recommendations. In France, for example, the recommended distance between customer and staff is one metre. The Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said it was working with industry ""at pace to develop safe ways for pubs, restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at the earliest opportunity it is safe to do so"". The government is expected to release guidelines on operating in a ""safe"" manner as soon as this week, so firms have time to prepare before reopening in England. More government support Trade association UK Hospitality is asking the government to provide further support for businesses if the two-metre rule remains in place in the UK. Its chief executive Kate Nicholls said: ""If we're operating at such a loss and furlough is going to be withdrawn, then it's vital that these businesses which have been cash-starved since March have additional funding to help with rents in particular, which is the second biggest overhead they're facing."" The majority of Wahaca's 1,000 employees have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme. Mr Selby credits the scheme with making things much easier for the restaurant chain: ""Before the furlough scheme, we said that we were going to have some very difficult decisions to make."" But he called for the government to go further: ""Businesses like ours in the restaurant space are absolutely going to need more support. ""I can guarantee for the next six to eight months, with sales where we expect them to be, we are going to need serious rent concessions."" Section 82 of the government's Coronavirus Act 2020 came into force on 25 March to help protect commercial tenants. It banned the forfeiture of commercial leases until 30 June 2020 - or longer if the government deems necessary - for non-payment of rent. But the Act has not prevented landlords from taking other legal actions against tenants in order to force them to pay rent withheld due to the lockdown. In May, the government said it would soon publish a code of conduct for both commercial landlords and tenants who are facing additional pressures on their finances. Casual dining in crisis Many casual dining chains have already been struggling in the face of rising overheads and falling consumer spending. Those in the hospitality sector have seen their troubles worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic, as customers have been forced to stay at home amid lockdown. Carluccio's, for example, was bought out of administration by the owner of Giraffe restaurants. Despite its rescue, more than 1,000 jobs will be lost at the Italian restaurant chain - over half of its total workforce. And last week The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny's, announced that as many as 120 outlets will not reopen after lockdown. In an email to managers seen by the BBC, the company said: ""Many sites are no longer viable to trade and will remain closed permanently. ""The coronavirus crisis has significantly impacted our ability to trade profitably, so we've taken the tough decision to close these restaurants now.""","""Starting up, it's going to be hell,"" says Mark Selby, chief executive and co-founder of Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca."
"Thatcham Research assessed the vulnerability of cars to computerised theft, where criminals hack the key fob signal to enter and start a vehicle. Models rated poor were the Ford Mondeo, Hyundai Nexo, Kia ProCeed, Lexus UX, Porsche Macan, and Toyota Corolla Hybrid. However, car industry trade body the SMMT criticised the methodology. The SMMT said Thatcham ""does not compare like with like"" and offered ""a signpost to thieves"". Car theft has been on the rise in the UK, rising by 27% from 2017, Thatcham said. On Wednesday, ratings agency Fitch had warned that UK motor insurers were unable to keep pace with the rising cost of claims after a steep increase in thefts. Relay attacks In 2018, there was £376m worth of car theft, according to Thatcham Research chief technical officer Richard Billyeald. ""Security has come a long way since vehicle crime peaked in the early 1990s. But the layers of security added over the years count for nothing when they can be circumvented instantly by criminals using digital devices,"" he said. Keyless car entry systems let drivers open and start their cars without taking their key out of their pocket. Thatcham looked at how susceptible new car models were to so-called ""relay attacks"", where thieves boost radio signals between the car and a key fob in a house to unlock and start the car. Thieves, normally working in pairs, will target a car parked outside a house. One criminal will hold a device close to the car that boosts the signal meant for the key, while the other thief will stand close to the house with another device that relays that signal to the key, fooling the system. Once the cars have been stolen, they will be stripped for parts, a police spokesman said. The parts could then be used to replace broken parts on a written-off car, allowing it to be sold on, or the parts could be sold direct to consumers via internet sites, the spokesman added. Thatcham said all of the six models had ""good"" security aside from the vulnerability. Car industry body the SMMT said it had ""serious concerns"" about Thatcham's rating system. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive said: ""It does not compare like with like, failing to differentiate vehicles with keyless and traditional entry systems in a combined rating and failing to distinguish between different model grades and specifications. ""It confuses rather than simplifies a very complex issue and will not help consumers, rather offering a signpost to thieves and increasing the risk of targeted criminal activity."" Ford said: ""Ford Motor Company takes vehicle security seriously and continuously invests in technology to deter theft of, and from, our vehicles."" The US car giant recommended people double-lock their cars, and store their keys in a ""suitable metal box"" that will block radio signals. Hyundai said it ""will continue to develop the advanced technologies of Nexo and all of our cars to incorporate effective counter-measures against all forms of criminal attack as quickly as we are able"". Kia Motors said it was aware of concerns around thefts from driveways and said it was ""constantly seeking to upgrade and enhance its security systems to counter this threat"". It added that Thatcham had not been in contact with Kia about the testing process, and said that in February Thatcham gave the Kia Proceed a security rating of four out of five stars. Toyota declined to comment. Porsche had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing.","Six new car models have been given a ""poor"" ranking in a theft-risk report on keyless entry vehicles."
"The company reported pre-tax profits of £1.4bn 2010, up from £266m in 2009. But ignoring exceptional items, underlying profits were up only 0.8%, while sales rose 1.8% to £22.4bn. BAE's share price fell sharply on the news. Tighter government spending in the UK and US had caused sales at its land and armaments unit to fall 6%, BAE said. The UK firm said that it did not expect sales at the division, which produces armoured combat vehicles and artillery among others, to rebound this year. ""It is expected that pressures on defence budgets, particularly in the US and UK, will continue,"" said the company in its preliminary results. ""Recent statements by the US Secretary of Defense indicated that the 2011 US defence budget is likely to include anticipated cost efficiencies, programme reductions and potential cancellations."" The division has yet to recover from a 54% collapse in sales the year before. The order book at the unit fell by a quarter. Markets took the news badly, with BAE's share price falling 4.5% in morning trading on the London Stock Exchange after the announcement on Thursday. BAE is seeking to cut its costs, with the announcement late last year of plans to shed 1,400 jobs in the UK. The anaemic underlying growth figures recorded by the UK group as a whole were largely in line with market expectations. Profits before tax for 2009 had been weighed down by exceptional items including a major contract cancellation and a change in pension accounting policy. BAE also noted that it faced a government investigation in the US into the death of an employee at its facility in Pennsylvania. The firm said it was also in ongoing dialogue with the US Department of Justice following a settlement reached with the UK authorities over payments made to an advisor in Tanzania. The company increased its dividend to 17.5p from 16p for 2009.","UK defence group BAE Systems has reported a rise in profits in 2010, but sales growth was sluggish following a decline in government spending."
"The majority of the RBS Shareholders Action Group of 9,000 investors have agreed to accept a £200m settlement relating to a £12bn bailout in 2008. But 13% of shareholders have still not accepted the deal, which was double the initial offer, the High Court heard. They are unlikely to pursue further action due to the high costs. Lawyers had been expected to tell the court that the matter was over - with shareholders getting 82p-a-share, compared with the 200p-230p they paid. However, Jonathan Nash QC, acting for the shareholders, said 13% have yet to make up their minds. Further action unlikely He added that he was hopeful a ""significant"" number would eventually accept the offer. Just one investor with 2,000 shares said he was ""dissatisfied"", versus most of the 13% who claimed ""they intend to accept the settlement proposal"", the court heard. The case had already been adjourned as the state-controlled bank and the claimants edged closer to a deal. A group of ""die hard"" investors were reported to be keener on seeing Fred Goodwin and other executives from the bank's darkest days in 2008 in court, rather than settling. There had been suggestions that these investors could continue to pursue the case, supposedly raising £7m to fund it. However, Mr Nash told the court: ""I wish to make it crystal clear the legal team has seen no evidence that funding is available."" Judge Robert Hildyard said the minority of rebel shareholders could apply for the trial to resume if they could prove they had sufficient funding by the end of July. ""In a difficult and novel situation, the process of bringing an end is not as easy as might be thought,"" Mr Hildyard told the court. RBS said in a statement the decision was a ""positive outcome"". The bank added: ""87% of the remaining claimants by value have accepted the settlement offer and the trial has now been vacated. This includes the Action Group, which represents the individual retail claimants. ""The offer remains open for acceptance for a short period to the further 13%. It was made clear today in court that this delay is the result of procedural issues. None of the outstanding claimants have indicated any intention to continue the claim."" The case had been due to start on Monday, 22 May, and had been scheduled to last for 14 weeks. However, it was adjourned and the parties began discussions over reaching a settlement. The dispute centres on RBS's decision, during the financial crisis, to ask shareholders for billions of pounds worth of funds after it bought Dutch rival ABN Amro. Shortly afterwards, the government was forced to prop up the bank with £45bn of taxpayers' money to save it from collapse. The state still owns a 72% stake in RBS. The bank and former directors deny any wrongdoing. The bank has already settled the majority of claims over the issue, but has not admitted liability.",A nine-year battle between RBS and angry shareholders ended at the High Court on Wednesday as a judge agreed to stop the case.
"The California company earned $104m (£82m) in the three months to 30 June, with the growth setting it on course for inclusion in the S&P 500. That means Tesla's shares, already surging, will see even more demand from investors who track the index. The stock crested higher in after-hours trading on publication of the results. Tesla said its bottom line was helped by salary cuts as well as the opening of its new factory in China, where costs are lower. Boss Elon Musk said the firm is focused on growth, with other plants in the works, including one in Germany and a new one he announced would be located near Austin, Texas. ""I've never been more excited and optimistic about the future of Tesla in the history of the company,"" Mr Musk said. Ahead of expectations In the US, the pandemic forced boss Elon Musk to keep the company's main factory in California closed until mid-May. While the shutdown weighed on the firm's output, it still beat analyst expectations. Tesla said it produced 82,272 cars and delivered 90,650 to customers, down about 5% from the same quarter in 2019. The decline hit revenue, which also fell about 5% to $6bn. But the overall resilience marks a contrast with rival car-makers, such as General Motors, many of which have reported sales declines of more than 30%. Tesla said it still hoped to deliver on promises to make 500,000 vehicles this year. ""We have the capacity installed to exceed 500,000 vehicle deliveries this year, despite recent production interruptions,"" the company said. ""While achieving this goal has become more difficult, delivering half a million vehicles in 2020 remains our target."" Tesla’s share price has nearly quadrupled since the start of the year, from $430 to more than $1,550. The eye-popping increase has added to the long-running debate over Tesla, which many critics maintain is overvalued. This month, the firm overtook Toyota as the world's most valuable carmaker, with a market worth of almost $300bn - although the Japanese company sold about 30 times more cars last year. Tesla had posted years of losses since its start. Achieving a fourth quarter in a row of profit makes it eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500, though its addition would have to be approved by the committee that governs the index. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said this could lead to a further rise in the share price, but he warned: ""While questions about the group's long term future may be a thing of the increasingly distant past its valuation remains a sore point for many."" On 1 May, Mr Musk himself tweeted Tesla’s share price was too high. The rise puts him in line for another major payday and has helped propel him into the ranks of the world's 10 richest people, according to billionaire rankings by Bloomberg and Forbes.",Electric car maker Tesla has shrugged off the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic to report its fourth quarterly profit in a row.
"By Dominic O'ConnellToday business presenter, in Davos Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, which manages $150bn, said populism was on a scale not seen since the 1930s, and could prove dangerous. The remarks follow a critical speech in Davos by top investor George Soros. He called Mr Trump an ""imposter"" and ""conman"", and expected him to fail. Mr Dalio's position is less negative. He told the BBC: ""On Trump, there are pluses and minuses. I don't think he is necessarily protectionist, and he is very pro-business with his policies. Soros: Trump is an imposter Trump 'would win' trade war with China Trump has 'enormous respect' for Merkel Davos coverage in full ""Money chases hospitable environments, and if you create an environment where the taxes are lower, for example, it can attract money from all over the place. Money moves very quickly. ""So, when those who run big companies are thinking about where they might put their next plant, they will look favourably at somewhere where there are low taxes, is pro-business, and has the rule of law. ""That's stimulative - so the world next year will have a higher growth rate as a result of those things, I think we can be pretty confident about that."" 'Negative consequences' Less positively, Mr Dalio explained why he thought some of the forces unleashed by Trump could be ""dangerous"". ""It [populism] can have negative consequences. It will have negative consequences for climate change, for globalisation."" He said it was also the biggest threat to the future of the European Union. ""In the 1930s nearly every country, with the exception of the US and UK, had populist leaders, who became more nationalist, more protectionist, and a malaise set. When we look towards Europe we have to be mindful that this is the major force that will now determine whether there is a European Union or not. ""It frightens me because it may not be well managed. There are things that I don't like about it, because it can lead to crises. It's often not well managed."" He said US stock markets had risen because of Trump's pro-business policies - in particular lower taxes: ""It's similar from the shift from the left to the right that took place in the 1980s, which ended up being very stimulative. Where we go from here has yet to be seen. ""We know that Donald Trump is aggressive - the question is whether he is going to be aggressive and prudent, or aggressive and careless. We don't know the answer. He has put together reasonable people around him, they don't seem reckless.""",The head of the world's largest hedge fund has said that President Donald Trump will be good for the US and world economy - but he fears the populist tide that took him to the Oval Office.
"He co-founded Alibaba in 1999 and it has become one of the world's biggest internet firms. Mr Ma's success and colourful style has made him one of China's most recognisable businessmen. Daniel Zhang, currently Alibaba's chief executive, will replace him as executive chairman. The company is now valued at $480bn (£389bn) and Mr Ma is China's richest man, with a net worth of $38.6bn according to Forbes. He is also the first founder among a generation of prominent Chinese internet entrepreneurs to step down from his company. ""I think it will be very hard to replace somebody like Jack Ma,"" said Rebecca Fannin, author of a book on China's technology titans. ""He is one of a kind. He is the Steve Jobs of China."" Who is Jack Ma? Born to a poor family in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, Mr Ma began his career as an teacher. He bought his first computer at the age of 33 and was surprised when no Chinese beers turned up in his first online search for ""beer"". With no background in computing, Mr Ma co-founded Alibaba in his apartment, having convinced a group of friends to invest in his online marketplace. It was not the first time he had tried to get a start-up off the ground. ""Alibaba was his third attempt at a company, he had two trials before,"" said Duncan Clark who has written a book about Mr Ma and is also chairman of investment consultancy BDA China. ""He saw the promise of the internet quite early on, but it took a while for him to have a vehicle."" Over the years, Alibaba has grown from an online marketplace into an e-commerce giant with interests ranging from financial services to artificial intelligence. It was originally set up as a trading platform for businesses, before expanding into consumer e-commerce in 2003 and later launching digital payment platform Alipay. Lacking a background in technology and with no particular strength in finance, Mr Clark said charisma and strategic vision have been Mr Ma's biggest assets. ""His charm is a big part of his leadership, his ability to convince people whether it's customers, employees or critically shareholders."" The author first met Mr Ma two decades ago and the entrepreneur spoke of making Alibaba one of the top 10 internet companies in the world within a decade. ""[It was] a sort of impossible ambition in a way but somehow he made people believe it,"" Mr Clark said. Mr Ma did turn his firm into an international heavyweight and its listing in New York set a record as the world's biggest public stock offering. Earlier this year, he argued in favour of the ""996 system"" where workers are expected to work 12 hour days, and a six-day week - a hotly debated topic in Chinese media. The flamboyant businessman is also known for enjoying the limelight and featured at an Alibaba event in 2017 wearing a Michael Jackson-themed outfit. What's next for Mr Ma? The 55-year-old is expected to focus on philanthropy and education after he steps down. Mr Clark said he has gradually brought technology and finance experts into Alibaba and more recently, Mr Ma has been ""consciously edging himself out"". Those moves are expected to ensure a more seamless transition for Alibaba to a future without its co-founder. Quiet, unassuming and known to shy away from the spotlight, Mr Zhang is nothing like his predecessor. Inside Alibaba Mr Zhang is reportedly known as Xiaoyaozi, the name of a character in a Chinese martial arts novel. It means the ""unfettered one""- someone who stays out of battles but is great at training others. That reputation will come in handy as he steers Alibaba through arguably some of its most challenging times. The Chinese market, where it makes two thirds of its revenue, is slowing down. At the same time, attempts to expand internationally have struggled. US scrutiny of Chinese firms is blocking its growth in the West. In parts of South East Asia and India, analysts say understanding how to work in local markets and with local people is proving to be a challenge for the Chinese company. Then there's the delayed multi-billion dollar public offering in Hong Kong, reportedly due to pro-democracy protests there. Yet Mr Zhang's greatest challenge may be living up to the image of Mr Ma himself, a man who enjoyed the respect and affection of his staff as well as the international community.","Alibaba chairman Jack Ma is due to step down from the e-commerce giant on Tuesday, marking the end of an era for the firm."
"The move comes as Equifax struggles to rebuild its reputation after it emerged earlier this month that the firm had suffered a massive data breach. Data on up to 143 million Americans may have been stolen by hackers between mid-May and July. About 400,000 Britons and a number of Canadians were also affected. The company said Paulino do Rego Barros, who currently runs the firm's Asia Pacific division, would take over as interim chief executive, while Mark Feidler would serve as non-executive chairman. Mr Smith said: ""At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward."" Equifax said it would undertake a search for a new permanent chief executive, looking at candidates from inside and outside the firm, while Mr Smith had agreed to stay on as an unpaid adviser during the transition. Chief information officer David Webb and chief security officer Susan Mauldin departed shortly after the firm disclosed the breach. Equifax faces dozens of legal claims over the breach, which the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating. Social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driving licence numbers for up to 143 million Americans were exposed, the Atlanta-based firm has said. Credit card numbers for about 209,000 Americans and ""certain dispute documents with personal identifying information"" for some 182,000 Americans were also accessed by the hackers. Lenders use data amassed by firms like Equifax to assess the credit worthiness of customers seeking to acquire houses, cars and credit cards. Equifax holds data on more than 820 million consumers as well as information on 91 million businesses. Senators said the incident shows the need for stronger rules on what companies must disclose about cyber attacks. They also asked if the Securities and Exchange Commission would take action against executives who sold Equifax stock after the breach was discovered but before the public was informed. Equifax has said previously the executives in question were not aware of the breach when the sales occurred. Speaking before a Senate panel on Tuesday, SEC Chair Jay Clayton said it is policy not to confirm or deny investigations, but added: ""I'm not ignoring this or other events like it.""","US credit report giant Equifax has announced that its chairman and chief executive, Richard Smith, is stepping down with immediate effect."
"The country's third-largest bank needs to raise €5bn in fresh capital by the end of the month. If Monte dei Paschi cannot arrange a private sector bailout, a state rescue may come as early as this week. It is saddled with bad loans and is deemed to be the weakest major EU bank. Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, whose government has only been in office for a week, is under pressure because private investors would suffer any losses under EU bailout rules. He described the move as a ""precautionary measure"", adding: ""We believe it is our duty to take this measure to protect savings. I hope all the political movements in parliament share this responsibility."" However, Italy's economy minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, stressed the funds would be used to ensure adequate liquidity in the banking system and support other struggling banks. Officials have also said they were examining a scheme to compensate retail investors for any losses incurred. Mr Gentiloni's predecessor, Matteo Renzi, resigned after losing a referendum on constitutional reform and was regularly accused of being too close to the banks.",The Italian government will seek parliamentary approval to borrow up to €20bn (£17bn) to support its fragile banking sector and potentially rescue Monte dei Paschi di Siena.
"In submissions made to a government-appointed review into rail, the firms also said long-distance routes should be serviced by more than one company. The Rail Delivery Group (RDG) added that control of commuter routes could be handed over to local authorities. It suggested commuter routes could be organised in a similar way to Transport for London in the capital. Local government oversees timetables and organisation in London, with private operators subcontracted to provide the services. ""We are suggesting replacing the current franchise system as it stands at the moment,"" RDG regional director Robert Nisbet told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""These proposals would result in a much more joined-up railway and greater accountability to passengers. ""We believe that would be best done by a system of dynamic contracts around the country. ""There would be an overarching apolitical body that would be in charge of this system, dealing with the trade-offs, but also policing it and issuing rules that bind and fines that bite. ""We are putting forward what we think is a compelling vision for both the public and private sectors working together in partnership, underpinned by an easier fare system which would deliver the best fare for any passenger whenever they took their journey."" The Strategic Rail Authority, which was established in 2000, used to carry out this role, but it was abolished in 2004. Henri Murison, director of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said: ""In the major northern cities, and across the Northern Powerhouse, this devolution would make it possible to integrate transport better. ""This is already being worked towards, with more touch-in-and-out travel within - and in between - our towns and cities in the North. ""This would be used by more of us as passengers if the government supports the fare system being reformed more quickly."" If you found the plot of Avengers: Endgame hard to follow - constant jumps backward and forward in time and endless reprises of old plots - then you can give up now on trying to understand what is happening on the reshaping of the railways. There has been constant discussion of the best structure for the industry since privatisation in the late 1990s. There is a well-established pattern: pressure for change gradually builds up to a reorganisation, which is given a short period of grace before the cycle begins again. We are at the late stages of a cycle, with Keith Williams, the former British Airways chief executive, in charge of delivering the new structural plan. The Rail Delivery Group's plans follow the Avengers: Endgame model - there are blasts from the past and missed ideas that have been tried before. The idea for a new central, non-political rail authority is both. There was a Strategic Rail Authority, which did some good - and along the way, trod on many important people's toes - which might have played a part in its eventual disbanding in 2004. Handing control of commuter routes to local authorities is an extension of what has already happened on some London commuter routes, with the creation of the London Overground, while the idea for competition between inter-city operators is straight out of Sir John Major's original privatisation blueprint. Mr Williams' task is to make sense of this convoluted plot and produce a plan that survives beyond the normal cycle of change. Currently, most UK rail services are operated by fixed-term franchises, which involve the Department for Transport (DfT) setting out a specification covering areas such as service levels, upgrades and performance. Train companies then submit bids to run the franchise and the DfT selects one of the applicants. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said the RDG was proposing a ""deregulated free-for-all"" that would lead to fare rises for customers. The RDG's vision is likely to be seen as an attempt to stave off nationalisation, as proposed by Labour. But the government has said privatisation has helped ""transform"" the industry. The UK's rail network has been beset by problems, with the East Coast Mainline brought back under government control in May - for the third time in a decade. Last year, hundreds of trains were cancelled amid a huge timetable reorganisation on services including Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. This month, Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids, including one in partnership with Virgin Group. The DfT disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules. Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF. Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected. Keith Williams, former chief executive of British Airways, is due to deliver a report on the future of the industry this autumn.","An independent body should oversee the rail network, according to Britain's railway companies."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter UK households spent the equivalent of $5,900 (£4,611) using payment cards online in 2015, the UK Cards Association said. This was higher than Norway ($5,400), the US ($4,500) and Australia ($4,000). The association suggested the frequency of debit and credit cards and the ease of delivering items drove online buys. New figures from the association showed that £154bn was spent on the internet using cards in 2016 - up by a quarter in two years. Cinema tickets Entertainment - such as cinema and concert tickets, takeaway orders and music downloads - accounted for one in four online card purchases in the UK. Some 67% of concert ticket spending and 61% of cinema, theatre and dance spending was made online, the association's figures showed. The popularity of renewing contracts such as insurance cover online, and payments into bank accounts over the internet also meant financial services registered considerable activity online. More than a quarter (27%) of what was spent online was in financial services. However, attempts of online retailers to make a mark in the grocery sector had so far failed in comparison to the use of cards in shops and supermarkets. Some 41% of in-store card purchases were on food and drink, compared with only 7% via the internet. Pawn shops, laundry and pubs, somewhat unsurprisingly, registered the least online shopping activity, the figures showed. Clicks or bricks Traditional retailers have felt a significant impact from the online shopping habits of customers. Earlier this week, High Street retailer Debenhams announced a change of strategy owing, in part, to fast-growing ""mobile interaction"". The plan means up to 10 of its 176 UK stores may be closed over the next five years. A central distribution warehouse and about 10 smaller warehouses could also be shut. A further cost burden was also felt, particularly by clothes retailers, as a result of online shoppers returning items they did not want during a statutory cooling-off period. Consumer analysts Savvy Marketing compiled figures for BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme and found that among 1,000 online shoppers questioned, women's clothing had been returned by 63% of them. Retailers said free returns were an important part of their business, but the costs had to be recovered somewhere or they risked going under. Many shoppers still fear that online shopping opens the door to cyber-criminals, but Richard Koch, head of policy at the UK Cards Association, argued that security was improving. ""Since the early days of internet shopping there has been a host of innovations, from digital wallets to one click purchases, which bring enhanced security, choice and convenience for customers and which will lead to continued growth in the sector. ""The additional protection provided when using a card also gives consumers extra peace of mind when they are shopping online,"" he said. Concerns have also been raised over internet selling fuelling a rise in shopping addiction. Some mental health problems manifest themselves in compulsive buying, making purchases which are later regretted. This could lead those affected into a spiral of debt. A report by the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute suggested that 24-hour online shopping meant ""consumers who struggle to control their spending find themselves at greater risk than ever before"". Retailers send personalised emails to customers, based on previous purchases, which may include short-term discounts and promotions.","Online shoppers in the UK spend more per household than consumers in any other country, a report says, amid a shift from stores to the internet."
"The Leicestershire firm was reportedly struggling to pay a tax bill and faced a winding-up order. Founded in 1898, Norton is one of the last remaining British motorcycle brands and best known for its involvement in motorsport. The administration puts about 100 jobs at its Castle Donington factory in question. Lee Causer, of administrators BDO, said: ""We are taking all necessary steps to ensure that customers, staff and suppliers are supported through the administration process. ""Our job is to determine and execute the most appropriate strategy as swiftly as possible to protect creditors' interests, bearing in mind the need to minimise distress for all parties."" Founded in Birmingham, Norton began making motorbikes in 1902 and soon became associated with races such as the Isle of Man TT. Among its most famous models are the Dominator and the Commando, while its Norton Interpol was used by UK police in the 1980s. Vintage models are now considered collectors' items. Its bikes have also featured in hit films such as the James Bond movie Spectre and the Che Guevara memoir, The Motorcycle Diaries. Norton fell into financial difficulties in 2008 but was rescued by entrepreneur and property developer Stuart Garner who revived the business. Mr Garner said last May that the firm was performing strongly and planned to open a new factory. However, this January he told local newspaper Birmingham Live that Norton owed tax authorities £300,000 and could be liquidated if it was not given more time to pay. Two other of Mr Garner's companies are also in administration, including his 42-bedroom Priest House Hotel in Castle Donington.",The famous British motorbike company Norton Motorcycles has gone into administration.
"The burger chain will reopen 15 outlets, with the locations of the UK and Ireland sites revealed next week. Paul Pomroy, head of McDonald's in the UK and Ireland, said ""We are working hard to reopen more restaurants... Slowly, but safely we will return."" However, there will be only a limited menu, and no breakfast offer. Mr Pomroy said: ""When we return it will be different as we all adjust to this new normal. I want to apologise in advance if our first wave of reopened restaurants does not serve your area. ""Rest assured, we are working hard to reopen more restaurants, but I am adamant this must be at the right pace with the wellbeing of our employees, suppliers and customers front of mind,"" he said. McDonald's uses Uber Eats and Just Eat for delivery. Food chains are slowly opening more outlets. On Thursday, KFC said it would reopen 80 more restaurants for deliveries, after already opening 20 sites. And Burger King has said it hopes to open at least 350 of its restaurants by the end of June as part of a staggered reopening. But bakery chain Greggs has said its planned branch reopenings next week will now begin behind closed doors. The sausage roll supplier is fearful of ""the risk that excessive numbers of customers"" may turn up. Earlier this week, it announced plans to reopen 20 stores in the Newcastle area from Tuesday on a trial basis.",McDonald's has revealed it will reopen its first restaurants for delivery only on 13 May after shutting sites due to the coronavirus lockdown.
"But on Sunday, the UK and European Union (EU) agreed to carry on post-Brexit trade talks beyond what they said would be the deadline. The UK and EU have been carrying out negotiations since March and are trying to secure a deal before the so-called transition period ends on 31 December. Talks have been deadlocked on a handful of key issues, including fishing quotas. Should they fail, tariffs - taxes on goods being bought and sold between the two - could be introduced and, prices of certain products may go up as a result. With the new deadline quickly approaching, what do firms think of yet another delay? 'It's utter confusion' Stephen Britt, is the managing director of Anchor Storage, in Suffolk. His family-founded firm helps customers with storage, warehousing and transport. Mr Britt voted in favour of the UK leaving the EU in the Brexit referendum, and he feels frustrated with how trade talks have fared since. ""We've long passed the time where we should have done a deal,"" he says. On the latest extension of the trade talks deadline, he adds: ""It would always have been better to have a mutually beneficial deal for everybody... But if we were going to get something agreeable, that would have happened by now."" Since mid-November, he says he has received enquiries from those looking to bring in additional goods early, in case of further disruption at ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""Nobody knows where they are, it's utter confusion."" He says that in any case though, many of his customers will have to adapt to new and more complex ways of moving goods between the UK and the EU. ""But, I've got to be optimistic and positive and say once we learn to deal with the new reality, it will be improved. ""I also hope technology will start kicking in so these cross-channel movements will become more streamlined."" 'Not a surprise' Ed Salt, managing director of Delamere Dairy, in Cheshire, says that another extension to the trade talks deadline came as little surprise. ""I've said for four years that if two sides desperately want a deal, a bit of pragmatism will come into play and we will eventually get one. ""It's more frustrating than anything"", he says, having never wanted the UK to leave the EU. Mr Salt also believes there will be additional costs for his firm, no matter what the outcome. ""With Christmas around the corner and Covid-19, as well as Brexit, it is literally the perfect storm."" He expresses frustration, too, with having to make changes to how his business operates, with little information. Having set up a new office and changed packaging on certain products to continue to be able to supply Northern Ireland post-Brexit, the rules changed once again, offering a three month grace period for food suppliers from Britain. ""Businesses are resilient, and presented with a challenge they tend to overcome it,"" he says. ""But they do need information in order to do that."" 'We're already anxious' Julie Price is the founder and managing director of Julie Price & Co insurance, in Hinckley, which employs five members of staff. ""Covid-19 has really caused havoc with businesses, and Brexit almost gets relegated as an issue,"" she says. But she adds that she's keen to see UK and EU leaders ""bash [a deal] out as soon as they can, because we're already anxious as a nation."" Ms Price says that she's already discussed no-deal Brexit contingency plans with several clients, who have put them in motion. ""At the smaller end of the scale, businesses are more flexible and can make changes even in a day. Your big corporations can't act that quickly."" She says that she's concerned that firms would not only be hit financially in the event of no-deal, but also in terms of confidence: ""I'm very pro-business and I want them to do well. Confidence is key in that. ""I'm sure we'll come through it, but it would be nice to have a bit more certainty"", she adds. 'Limbo makes doing anything very difficult' In Grimsby, Jo Smedley, the founder of Red Herring Games, creates and sells games such as murder mysteries to private and corporate clients. She told the BBC that while ""being in limbo makes doing anything very difficult"", her business would largely be sheltered from the impact of a no-deal Brexit. With clients mainly based outside of Europe, ""in terms of sales, I don't think there will be much of an effect"". ""But of course, we don't know what impact Brexit might have until we're a bit clearer on the new rules,"" she says. She adds that she's not surprised that talks have ground to a halt on several occasions. ""It's a very difficult situation, given that we're leaving, rather than negotiating to get into the EU. We're not holding any of the cards, really."" For Jo, she hopes for additional certainty in 2021 for businesses like hers: ""The more uncertainty we have, the harder it is for you trade - particularly if you have big business decisions to be making. We just need to get on with it.""","The coronavirus pandemic, the Christmas rush moving online, and the potential of a no-deal Brexit: Businesses big and small have had a great deal to contend with in 2020."
"Punch Taverns founder Hugh Osmond and Greater Manchester's night time economy adviser, Sacha Lord, said the industry is losing £200m a day. In a letter to the prime minister, they said there is no ""evidence or justification"" to open shops five weeks before pubs and restaurants. They said it is ""plainly irrational"". The government has insisted the lockdown easing must be cautious if it is to be irreversible, adding that it will driven by data and not dates. Under current plans, non-essential retail will be able to open from 12 April if new coronavirus infections are kept under control. Outdoor hospitality, such as beer gardens, will also be allowed to reopen then. But pubs and restaurants will not be allowed to welcome customers through their doors to sit inside until at least 17 May. The industry has long argued that pubs re-opening last July had a negligible effect on infections, which only began to rise after schools reopened. And the Chancellor recently defended his own Eat out to Help out scheme, arguing that it protected jobs. The two men have asked the government to seek specific advice from scientists ""whether it is justifiable to prevent the hospitality industry opening whilst, at the same time, allowing non-essential shops to open"". They argued that ""transmission is plainly higher in non-essential shops,"" and said they would pursue legal action if the government did not provide evidence to the contrary. ""This legal case will give a fighting chance to over three million people who work in hospitality, to the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors - large and small - forced into bankruptcy, and to millions of our loyal customers who have been deprived of the human social interaction they experience in our premises,"" Mr Osmond said. He added that the extended lockdown for hospitality venues could have a ""potentially indirectly discriminatory effect"" on young people and people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds working in the sector. ""I believe we can show that discrimination and unsubstantiated beliefs, rather than facts, science and evidence, lie at the heart of much of the government's approach to hospitality, and these wrongs need to be righted.""",Two of the biggest names in hospitality have threatened to take the government to court over its plans to release England from lockdown.
"By Tom JacksonCape Town Instead, she's one of a growing number of people in South Africa's Mother City who are leaving their wallets at home in favour of digital money apps. ""I use SnapScan,"" she says. ""I love it. If I find someone using SnapScan I will buy something even if I wasn't intending to. ""I find myself telling small coffee shops and vendors at markets that they should get it. I love not needing cash on me. I love not handing over my credit card."" Fast payments Views like these account for the arrival of a number of different mobile payments options. SnapScan has garnered the most attention, but the sector also includes the likes of FlickPay, Zapper and GustPay. SnapScan merchants receive a static QR [quick response] code - or SnapCode - identifier to display next to their tills. Customers register on the app and link their credit card, paying by scanning the code with their phones, and confirming the payment with a PIN or fingerprint. The merchant receives confirmation of the payment on their nominated phone. ""At its core, SnapScan is about giving everyone access to fast, convenient and safe electronic purchases,"" says co-founder Kobus Ehlers. ""We designed the product to suit a wide variety of shops, from the largest retailer to a small street vendor selling fruit next to the side of the road."" SnapScan has also partnered with the City of Cape Town to allow motorists to pay parking marshals in the city using the app. Each marshal is equipped with a unique QR code that motorists scan to pay for their parking. And even Big Issue sellers can now accept SnapScan mobile payments. FlickPay's system is the other way round, where the user ""flicks to pay"" by pushing a slider button on the app and entering a PIN, which generates the unique QR code. The retailer then scans this code with a QR reader installed on the till. ""It's all about ease and efficiency,"" says Zac Rusagara, head of commercials at FlickPay. ""It is easing the process, and it is being on trend. It's cool."" Plastic not so fantastic Cost is also a factor. ""We aim to drive down the cost of electronic transactions and displace cash payments in many places,"" says Mr Ehlers. ""SnapScan does not charge shoppers any fees. Merchants pay a small transaction fee that is comparable or cheaper than using normal credit card facilities."" FlickPay is also free for customers, while Mr Rusagara says his company works with retailers to agree a transaction price equal or less than that charged by a bank, known as its acquiring rate. ""We are not set on acquiring rate, we are much more flexible and able to come to a solution that works for both parties,"" he says. This cheaper and more efficient way of making transactions seems to be appealing to customers and merchants alike, with both SnapScan and FlickPay now available nationwide. Mr Ehlers says he is ""very heartened"" by SnapScan's growth, with approximately 14,000 merchants accepting payments using the service in South Africa, and thousands of users making payments each week. Mr Rusagara would only say FlickPay has a ""sizeable"" market share. South Africa certainly seems to have embraced mobile payments with enthusiasm - roughly half the population now owns a smartphone. And one bank, FNB reports that its customers are making 230 million mobile payment transactions per month, compared to 45 million on the popular M-Pesa platform in Kenya. Cashless then cardless This growth potential has not gone unnoticed by global companies. Apple rolled out its mobile payments service, Apple Pay, in September, enabling iPhone 6 users to buy goods using the phone's ID fingerprint recognition system. SnapScan and FlickPay say they believe Apple's move into payments will benefit the ecosystem as a whole. Mr Ehlers says SnapScan is not positioned as just another payment product, and feels that card systems and next-generation card systems such as Apple Pay will help a large sector of the retail market. ""SnapScan instead tries to give access to electronic payments to a large group of merchants who do not qualify for formal card payment facilities, or where card machines do not make sense,"" he says. Mr Rusagara says: ""It is not the first time people have been used to linking their credit cards to their phones. People like Apple have actually paved the way for us. ""Then people like Uber have come to the market. So people have become a lot more comfortable with the idea of linking their phones to their cards to make a transaction."" Independent corporate finance and financial technology consultant Theo Winter believes that Apple Pay's impact will be limited in South Africa. ""Apple Pay requires merchant PoS [point of sale] integration, so will take a while to roll out here,"" he says. ""We should also keep in mind that South African market dynamics are different to those of the US."" Security concerns? One concern is over security. Rahul Jain, co-founder of secure payments solution Peach Payments, says credit card data is not adequately protected in the event of loss or theft of a mobile device. Regulation has yet to catch up, he believes. ""Regulation and guidelines around mobile transactions and data security are not as developed as those for web payments and services,"" says Mr Jain. ""So what you are seeing is that organisations such as the PCI Security Standards Council are increasingly treating these transactions separately, and then coming up with guidelines on how merchants and service providers can secure the card data on mobile devices and payment applications."" Mr Winter, however, feels security is actually enhanced by the likes of SnapScan and FlickPay, as the customer's credit card is never handled by the merchant so cannot be skimmed or copied. Mr Rusagara says the system is secure for both customer and retailer, with QR codes expiring upon use, or after 90 seconds. Security doubts aside, the growth of such solutions continues apace, and Mr Ehlers sees the potential for mobile payments to extend into other areas, such as the Cape Town parking payments option. ""We've seen a lot of interest from churches in the last few weeks, for instance, as the app allows for immediate, relatively large donations, while also eliminating the hassle of managing and administrating cash collections,"" he says. ""We hope to be able to continue offering this product to customers in a variety of settings, always making their lives a little easier.""",Capetonian Sam Laing sounds like a brand ambassador when she talks about her favourite local mobile payments application.

"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has received more than 17,500 complaints from people whose holidays have been hit by the virus. In an open letter from the CMA, companies have been reminded of the 14-day refund rule for cancellations. Travel firms say this has been an unprecedented crisis that put many of them on the brink of collapse. Consumers' rights By law, if a package holiday is cancelled by the provider, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days. Many thousands of getaways were cancelled during lockdown, when the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel outside of the UK. The CMA said its investigations found that some businesses may not have been giving these legally-required refunds. Other problems included: In the letter, CMA director Cecilia Parker Aranha said the regulator recognised the ""extraordinary pressures"" faced by the sector. ""Although we were sympathetic to the challenges faced in the early days of the pandemic, it is nonetheless important that businesses comply with consumer law,"" she added. A spokeswoman for Abta, which represents the package holiday sector, said the pressures were continuing and that many companies, with loyal customers, had mutually agreed to a rebooked holiday rather than a refund. She said Abta had conducted its own investigations of members when customers had been misled. However, she added that package holiday companies were themselves facing delays from airlines in refunding them the flight element of any holiday. ""Many airlines, in particular, have been and continue to be very slow in passing refunds back to package holiday businesses, which means that those package holiday businesses are unable to refund their customers as promptly as they would wish,"" she said. ""It is essential, therefore, that effective regulatory action is taken against the airlines that are not currently refunding with seven days, as required under relevant consumer protection legislation."" Airlines are regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority which has been putting pressure on companies to comply. What are my rights?",More than 100 holiday companies have been told to speed up their refunds policy for coronavirus cancellations.
"Japan's economy was worth $5.474 trillion (£3.414 trillion) at the end of 2010, figures from Tokyo have shown. China's economy was closer to $5.8 trillion in the same period. Japan has been hit by a drop in exports and consumer demand, while China has enjoyed a manufacturing boom. At its current rate of growth, analysts see China replacing the US as the world's top economy in about a decade. ""It's realistic to say that within 10 years China will be roughly the same size as the US economy,"" said Tom Miller of GK Dragonomics, a Beijing-based economic consultancy. The US economy is currently almost three times the size of the Chinese economy in dollar terms. The UK's economy is estimated to be the world's sixth largest. Overseas risk Japan played down the significance of the shift in the economic league table, and the fact that it has been replaced as the second-largest economy for the first time in more than four decades. ""As an economy, we are not competing for rankings but working to improve citizens' lives,"" said Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano. The minister added that China's booming economy was welcome news for Japan as a neighbouring country. China is now Japan's main trading partner and is increasingly important to companies such as electronics firm Sony and carmakers like Honda and Toyota. However, Mr Yosano said that Japan needed to watch closely ""risks from overseas economies and currency moves"". Negative demand The yen has been strengthening against other currencies, recently touching a 15-year high against the dollar, and the fear is that the currency's gains may hurt foreign demand for Japanese products. According to the latest figures from Tokyo, Japan's economy contracted at an annualised rate of 1.1% in the final three months of 2010. Growth declined 0.3% from the previous quarter. It was the first time in five quarters that the economy had contracted and it was caused by a dip in domestic and export demand, analysts said. Consumer spending fell 0.7% in the final three months of 2010, the figures showed. Analysts said that while demand had been picking up since the start of the year, there would not be a sudden revival in Japan's economic fortunes. Not least because government plans to boost consumer spending by giving incentives to buy products such as consumer durables had either finished or were about to end. ""The main reasons for the contraction are the expiry of government stimulus measures and negative external demand,"" said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. ""It is going to be difficult for the economy to emerge from a lull in the January-March period. ""We are unlikely to see the economy worsen, but the recovery will not be strong enough for people to actually feel it is happening."" 'Lost decade' Japan has been struggling to come to terms with what many analysts call the ""lost decade"" of the 1990s when a property market and asset crash turned the economy on its head. Domestic demand tumbled and exports also dropped as consumers looked for cheaper products from other emerging markets, and China in particular. Today, Japan's biggest headaches are an ageing population that is spending less, and a workforce that is relatively expensive and inflexible to operate. By contrast, the majority of China's growth has been funded by a long-running manufacturing boom and the subsequent expansion of its domestic industries and infrastructure. ""There was an emphasis on infrastructure,"" said Duncan Innes-Ker of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in Beijing. ""They were building way ahead of where people thought the demand would be. And because the infrastructure was there, companies went there."" Whole picture Most economists agree that while China as a whole is growing, and the average person is getting wealthier, comparing only the size of its economy to Japan's does not paint an accurate enough picture. ""Most people in China are still poor, more people live in the countryside than in cities,"" said Mr Miller of GK Dragonomics. ""The average Japanese person is much much richer than the average Chinese person."" The International Monetary Fund estimates that GDP per head of the population is almost $34,000 in Japan, while in the People's Republic of China it is just over $7,500.",China has overtaken Japan as the world's second-biggest economy.
"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the firm offered to make the payment following an investigation. The CMA said it suspects competition law was broken after Aspen paid two rivals to stay out of the market. This left Aspen as the only UK supplier of fludrocortisone and able to set prices without competition, it added. Aspen may also have to pay an additional £2.1m fine if the CMA formally decides the company broke the law. Andrea Coscelli, the CMA's chief executive, said it was ""unacceptable for the NHS - and the taxpayers who fund it - to have to pay millions of pounds more than they should for this life-saving drug"". The prescription-only fludrocortisone is mainly used to treat Addison's Disease, a rare deficiency of the adrenal glands. This is the first time a CMA investigation will secure a payment such as this for the NHS. In addition, Aspen will ensure that there are at least two fludrocortisone suppliers in the UK. Shares in the firm dropped nearly 7% after the announcement. Aspen said in a statement to investors that commitments it made, including the £8m payment to the NHS, did not ""constitute an admission of any wrongdoing by Aspen"" under EU law. However, it said it had admitted liability ""for entering into an agreement to acquire a potential competitor in fludrocortisone with the consequence that the conclusion of this agreement resulted in anti-competitive behaviour"". It added that the CMA would impose a penalty ""which shall not exceed £2,101,954"".",Drugs firm Aspen is to pay £8m to the NHS after an investigation into the supply of a life-saving drug to thousands of patients.
"The Executive Remuneration Working Group said there was ""widespread scepticism and loss of public confidence"" over executive pay. Sainsbury's chairman David Tyler and Legal & General chief executive Nigel Wilson worked on the interim report. The report wants reform of long-term bonus schemes and more transparency. Mr Wilson, the working group's chairman, said: ""The current approach to executive pay in UK listed companies is not fit for purpose, and has resulted in a poor of alignment of interests between executives, shareholders and the company. ""Greater transparency, clearer alignment of shareholder, company and executive interests, more accountability on the part of Remuneration Committees and greater engagement with and control by shareholders, working through company boards, are vital to restore confidence in a system widely seen as broken."" Despite the fact the FTSE all-share index of public companies was trading at broadly the same levels as 1998, executive pay over the same period has more than trebled, the report says. The ""widespread scepticism"" among the public over whether executives deserve their rewards was damaging for the big company sector, it said. Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor The problem is that boards are very good at selling high pay formulas to shareholders. Do we want a high performance company? Hell yeah! Comes the reply. Do we want a top class management team? You bet! Are we a top quartile kind of outfit? Yes! So we're all agreed we'll get ourselves a top quartile CEO? Thus the decision tree grows and a star CEO is plonked on top. When every company does this, pay ratchets up pretty quickly. Shareholders may be revolting but they only have themselves to blame. Read Simon Jack's blog The report comes amid controversy over boardroom pay at several companies. Last week, 59% of BP shareholders voted against a £13.8m package for chief executive Bob Dudley, one of the largest revolts against boardroom pay in the UK. Transparency There is also unrest among shareholders at other companies, including HSBC, WPP and Reckitt Benckiser as they prepare to hold their annual meetings in the coming weeks. The working group's report, published in conjunction with the Investment Association, was particularly concerned about the widespread use of the three-year Long-Term Incentive Plans. The LTIP terms can quickly become outdated if a company's performance changes, producing what it calls ""perverse consequences"". The group wants remuneration committees, the bodies that set pay terms, to be more accountable for the decisions they make. These committees ""need to ensure that remuneration outcomes are fully aligned with overall business performance and strategy. Discretion should be used, both upwards and downwards, rather than committees relying on formulaic outcomes."" The report also wants greater transparency in how bonus terms are reached, and calls on major institutional shareholders to be more proactive in the pay debate. A number of roundtables will be set up to discuss the interim report, with representatives from companies, the investment community, and other pay experts taking part. A full report is expected to be ready by the summer, the Investment Association said. The report was welcomed by the Institute of Directors. Its director-general, Simon Walker, who spoke out last week about the pay concerns over BP, said: ""It is increasingly clear that there is a problem with executive pay at big listed companies. The introduction of binding votes on pay policy has not had the kind of immediate and positive impact regulators and government would have wanted. ""Today's report is a timely and important intervention in the debate around how remuneration is designed. Importantly, the report also recommends that pay policies for senior executives are consistent with the approach for other employees. This is a worthy intervention that, if adopted by the market, could go a long way to restoring trust in our largest companies.""","Executive pay in the UK is ""not fit for purpose"" and needs reform, according to a group that included some of Britain's most high-profile bosses."
"By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent But with much less recognition, Canada has climbed into the top tier of international rankings. In the most recent round of international Pisa tests, Canada was one of a handful of countries to appear in the top 10 for maths, science and reading. The tests, run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), are a major study of educational performance and show Canada's teenagers as among the best educated in the world. They are far ahead of geographical neighbours such as the US and European countries with strong cultural ties like the UK and France. At university level, Canada has the world's highest proportion of working-age adults who have been through higher education - 55% compared with an average in OECD countries of 35%. Migrant students Canada's success in school tests is also very unusual compared with other international trends. The top performers are often cohesive, compact societies and the current highest achiever, Singapore, has been seen as a model of systematic progress, with each part of the education system integrated into an overarching national strategy. Canada does not even really have a national education system, it is based on autonomous provinces and it is hard to think of a bigger contrast between a city state such as Singapore and a sprawling land mass such as Canada. The OECD, trying to understand Canada's success in education, described the role of the federal government as ""limited and sometimes non-existent"". Also not widely recognised is that Canada has a high level of migrants in its school population. More than a third of young adults in Canada are from families where both parents are from another country. But the children of newly-arrived, migrant families seem to integrate rapidly enough to perform at the same high level as their classmates. When the most recent Pisa rankings are looked at more closely, at regional rather than national level, the results for Canada are even more remarkable. If Canadian provinces entered Pisa tests as separate countries, three of them, Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec, would be in the top five places for science in the world, alongside Singapore and Japan and above the likes of Finland and Hong Kong. So how has Canada overtaken so many other countries in education? Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's education director, says Canada's ""big uniting theme is equity"". Despite the different policies in individual provinces, there is a common commitment to an equal chance in school. He says there is a strong sense of fairness and equal access - and this is seen in the high academic performance of migrant children. Global education Ideas for the Global education series? Get in touch. Within three years of arriving, the Pisa tests show the children of new migrants have scores as high as the rest of their schoolmates. It makes Canada one of the few countries where migrant children achieve at a level similar to their non-migrant counterparts. Another distinguishing feature is that Canada's teachers are well paid by international standards - and entry into teaching is highly selective. Equal chances Prof David Booth, from the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, highlights Canada's ""strong base in literacy"". There have been systematic efforts to improve literacy, with well-trained staff, resources such as school libraries and testing and assessment to identify schools or individuals who are struggling. Prof John Jerrim, of the UCL Institute of Education in London, says that Canada's high league table ranking reflects the narrow socio-economic gap in school results. Rather than a country of extremes, Canada's results show a very high average, with relatively little difference between advantaged and disadvantaged students. In the most recent Pisa results for science, the variation in scores in Canada caused by socio-economic differences was 9%, compared with 20% in France and 17% in Singapore. The equitable outcome goes a long way to explaining why Canada is doing so well in international tests. It does not have a tail of underachievement, often related to poverty. It is a remarkably consistent system. As well as little variation between rich and poor students, there is very little variation in results between schools, compared with the average for developed countries. Rather than high levels of immigration being seen as a potential drag on results, Prof Jerrim says in Canada's case, this is likely to be part of its success story. Migrants coming to Canada, many from countries such as China, India and Pakistan, are often relatively well-educated and ambitious to see their children get into professional careers. Prof Jerrim says these families have an immigrant ""hunger"" to succeed, and their high expectations are likely to boost school results for their children. Prof Booth from the University of Toronto also points to the high expectations of these migrant families. ""Many families new to Canada want their children to excel at school, and the students are motivated to learn,"" he said. This has been a bumper year for education in Canada. The universities are reaping the benefits of the Trump effect, with record levels of applications from overseas students seeing Canada as a North American alternative to the United States. There has also been a Canadian winner of the Global Teacher Prize, with Maggie MacDonnell using the award to campaign for indigenous students. As Canada marks its 150th anniversary, it can claim the status of an education superpower.","When there are debates about the world's top performing education systems, the names that usually get mentioned are the Asian powerhouses such as Singapore and South Korea or the Nordic know-alls, such as Finland or Norway."
"The firm, which bought SSE's retail business last year, sent inaccurate statements to more than half a million customers. Meanwhile, some of its customers did not receive a bill at all, the energy watchdog Ofgem said. The firm agreed a settlement package with Ofgem to dodge a fine. The money will be paid to vulnerable customers rather than the Treasury. Despite knowing about the issues, Ovo did not tell Ofgem. Failures since 2015 ""Ovo Energy billed a number of its customers incorrectly and issued them with inaccurate information,"" said Anthony Pygram, head of enforcement at Ofgem. ""The supplier did not prioritise putting these issues right whilst its business was expanding."" In a statement, the energy company said ""Ovo Energy holds itself to high standards, but we have not always got it right."" Ovo - which was created 10 years ago - is already the UK's largest independent energy supplier, with 1.5 million customers and about 2,000 employees. But after buying SSE it has taken on another 3.5 million customers and 8,000 staff, making it second only to British Gas. Although another deal between E.On and Npower could push it into third place when Ofgem data is next published. Ofgem launched an investigation into Ovo after a series of failures dating back to July 2015. Write offs The regulator said thousands of customers were charged the wrong amount after Ovo underestimated fuel usage over winter 2017. At least one customer was overcharged by more than £4,500, although Ovo said it had issued a refund. But Ovo decided not to refund customers who were overcharged by less than £10, Ofgem said. In its report, the watchdog said: ""Ovo explained that it did not believe it was an efficient use of resources to process 120,000 small value refunds."" ""These monies did not belong to Ovo but to the customers impacted by Ovo's mistake."" However, the firm did later refund some customers and it also wrote off some underpayments of less than £100. Ofgem said Ovo also gave inaccurate pricing information to around 160,000 customers. ""Ovo's failure to issue accurate documents may have resulted in some customers making decisions to switch or remain with Ovo based on inaccurate information,"" Ofgem said. ""These customers may have suffered detriment in missed savings opportunities."" Ovo was not the only energy firm in Ofgem's sights on Wednesday. Utility Warehouse was forced to pay out £650,000 after it overcharged customers due to a systems error. The regulator said the energy company would refund £450,000 to 3,430 customers who paid too much - an average of £131.20 each. It was also made to pay £200,000 into the redress fund for vulnerable customers.","Ovo, which may become the UK's second-largest energy company, has been forced to pay £8.9m by regulators after it overcharged customers."
"Such a big number is hard to picture, but for that money you could buy Tesco 40 times over, or Manchester United 200 times. It is the job of the chancellor of the exchequer to oversee the collection and distribution of those funds. Philip Hammond will lay out his plans on Monday, 29 October when he presents the Budget for the financial year which starts in April 2019. His biggest money earner is income tax, but its importance has drifted lower in recent years. That is partly because the government has raised the threshold at which the basic rate, and the higher rate, is paid. The trend is also a result of a change in the way people work. The rise of self-employment has curtailed tax returns as those workers often pay less income tax. The same applies to National Insurance, although that stream of income was boosted in 2016 when rebates on National Insurance payments were ended. Over the years VAT has become a more important supply of tax. Back in 2011 the standard rate was raised from 17.5% to 20%. VAT returns are also closely tied to the health of the economy and consumer spending, so the economic recovery since the financial crisis has raised the amount of VAT collected. How is it spent? As for outgoings, social spending is by far the biggest outlay for the government, accounting for more than a quarter of all spending. It includes spending on state pensions, which has taken a rising share of government spending since 2008. But the other big element, benefits payments, has accounted for less of overall spending since 2013, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. With an 18.5% share of the government budget, health is the next biggest government outlay. That share has been increasing for decades, a trend which is likely to continue as the population ages and better, but potentially more expensive, treatments and medicines enter the market. Education is the third biggest area of spending, with an 11.1% share - down from 13% in 2007. But that figure is skewed by the move away from student grants to loans, which are not counted as spending. The figures for income and spending will also look a little different in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Since 1999, devolved administrations have been responsible for spending on certain policy areas, including education and local government. Each administration receives funds from the UK Treasury, using a mechanism called the Barnett formula. In addition, Scotland and Wales also control stamp duty and landfill tax returns and Scotland has control over other taxation areas. You can find out more here. The Scottish government is to set out its draft budget on 12 December.",The government raises and spends just under £800bn a year.
"Gross domestic product rose by 7.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, compared to 7.5% in the previous quarter, official data showed. The figure beat market forecasts for 7.2% growth but still marked its weakest performance since March 2009. Industrial production also came in better than analyst estimates. Manufacturing output rose 8% in September against a year earlier. However, fixed asset investment and retail sales missed expectations. China's National Bureau of Statistics said retail sales increased 11.6% from a year earlier, compared to forecasts for 11.7%. Fixed-asset investment excluding rural households rose 16.1% in the first nine months from a year earlier, below analyst estimates for a 16.3% increase. Overall, the figures show that growth continues to slow in the world's second-largest economy, raising concerns it may have knock-on effects on the strength of the global recovery. ""China's slowdown comes several years after corrections began in other emerging markets,"" Bill Adams, senior international economist for PNC Financial Services Group, said. ""As long as China keeps trending slower like this, it will be difficult for global commodity prices to rise, a persistent headwind for commodity producers like Brazil and Australia."" More stimulus? China's government aims to achieve 7.5% economic growth this year, but many analysts believe that they will not be able to meet that target. There is also speculation the government may take more steps to boost growth. Beijing recently unveiled measures aimed at stimulating more consumer spending, including relaxing its limits on home purchases and injecting billions of dollars into its biggest banks. China's central bank also cut the interest rate it pays lenders for 14-day repurchase agreements last week. Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics, believes problems in the property sector have dragged on growth, but that overall, the broader economy remains ""healthy"". ""We don't think policymakers will panic as a result of the slowdown given that it remains highly concentrated in a few sectors suffering from overcapacity,"" he said. ""The upshot is that although growth has slowed, it reflects a welcome rebalancing away from excess investment in certain sectors of the economy and is not cause for significant concern.""","China's economy grew at its slowest pace since the global financial crisis, causing speculation the government may introduce more stimulus measures."
"By Eleanor LawrieBusiness reporter, BBC News But there have long been problems at the firm, which was rescued from collapse just a year ago. What went wrong at Flybe, which was Europe's largest regional airline? 1. Operating regionally made it vulnerable Flybe operated about 40% of regional UK flights, so it was particularly exposed to anything that went wrong in the domestic market. This meant a recent fall in demand prompted by the coronavirus outbreak just added to its list of woes at home. It already had to contend with storms disrupting travel, and the effects of Brexit including sluggish UK consumer spending. The weak pound following the referendum also worsened the impact of increased fuel and aircraft leasing costs. There was also a constant pressure on the airline to be competitive with rail and road travel. 2. It operated in an incredibly competitive market Aviation is a notoriously competitive industry at the best of times. ""It is saddled with high-cost assets, namely planes, and key costs that fluctuate uncontrollably, mainly fuel, which accounts for around a third of total airline costs,"" Prof Loizos Heracleous, a Warwick Business School aviation expert recently told the BBC. ""On top of that, they face high regulation, often aggressive unions, low barriers to entry that increase competition, and high bargaining power of buyers."" The UK is particularly competitive, with Flybe squeezed between major airlines such as British Airways and the big low-cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet. At the same time, average fares have fallen, squeezing margins and leaving no room for mistakes. When the carrier was taken over by a consortium last February, it was posting losses of around £20m a year. 3. It paid more tax than other airlines Many Flybe routes were domestic, placing it at a tax disadvantage. Airlines have to pay Air Passenger Duty (APD), a tax per passenger on flights taking off in the UK. For international flights, Air Passenger Duty only has to be paid on the route out of the country. But for journeys within the UK, APD is paid both on departure and arrival. The levy is thought to have cost Flybe more than £100m a year, something it had long complained about. The government was considering a cut in APD on domestic flights to help Flybe, which operated more than half of UK internal flights outside London. But this was unlikely to come into effect until next year, as the UK is wary of contravening EU state aid rules while still in the Brexit transition period. 4. It had too many planes A decade ago, Flybe was listed on the stock market as part of an ambitious pan-European expansion plan. The listing raised money to buy more planes, including an £850m order for 35 Embraer 175 jets to ""underpin"" its expansion into Western Europe. But for years after that it struggled with overcapacity. ""They ended up putting planes on routes to use up the aeroplanes, rather than buying a fleet to fly routes effectively and successive managements battled with that burden,"" Andrew Lobbenberg, analyst at HSBC aviation research, told the Today Programme. 5. The owners wanted different things Over the past decade, Flybe has been rebranded twice, gone through four chief executives and neared collapse three times. It has also undergone several restructurings. A year ago, the carrier was bought for £2.2m by a consortium of Virgin Atlantic, Stobart Group and Cyrus Capital. But the owners ""were strange bedfellows"" who wanted different things from the acquisition, says John Strickland, an aviation analyst at JLS Consulting. ""We had two airlines with very different business models. Virgin was interested in Flybe to feed more passengers into its long haul flights into its airports at Heathrow and Manchester, while Stobart flies regional routes itself. ""Cyrus Capital were venture capitalists looking to make a return on their investments. None of these were compatible with each other, and I'm sure they had different opinions over time,"" he told the BBC's Wake Up To Money.","UK airline Flybe has gone into administration, placing some of the blame on the coronavirus outbreak."
"By Tom EspinerBusiness reporter, BBC News ""If I hadn't had been pregnant, I definitely would have killed myself,"" she said. ""It was the worst thing. It was so shameful."" Seema is one of the hundreds of Post Office workers - mainly sub-postmasters - who were accused of theft after using the Post Office Horizon IT system, which is provided by Fujitsu. The Post Office has agreed to pay nearly £58m to settle with 557 claimants after a long-running dispute over the system. In addition, the Criminal Cases Review Commission is looking into whether a number of the convictions were miscarriages of justice. Seema became a sub-postmistress in West Byfleet in Surrey in June 2005 and was suspended in January 2008 after an audit found a discrepancy of £74,000 in her accounts. She had been feeding at least £100 per day from her shop into the Post Office tills, because of discrepancies in balancing the accounts. One day there was a £10,000 hole. This went on for two years, she said, with very little support from the Post Office. She balanced the Post Office books by transferring takings from her shop, but sometimes that wasn't enough, and so she ended up borrowing money from relatives. After an audit, the Post Office sent her a court summons and a jury found her guilty. Seema was sent to Bronzefield Prison, where she was locked up with ""drug addicts and people self-harming"". ""I was so scared,"" she said. When she rang home, ""on the phone, there would be blood"", she said. While she was in prison, her husband was beaten up on a number of occasions by locals who had heard about her case through the local newspaper, which she said characterised her as ""a pregnant thief"". The couple decided to move from West Byfleet, but her ordeal lasted far longer than her sentence. They lost the Post Office business and their house, and found it difficult to rent accommodation because of her conviction. Seema became a virtual recluse, scared to go out into the local community and make friends in case they found out about her conviction, and unable to find work. The situation has only started to ease over the past few years as question marks have repeatedly been raised over the convictions. ""After seven years, we have celebrated our son's birthday for the first time this year,"" Seema said. The Post Office settlement is ""a step in the right direction"", she said, but she is now focused on trying to get her conviction overturned. ""I am 100% sure that my name will be cleared,"" she said. 'I wouldn't say sorry' Tracy Felstead was just 19 when she was sent to Holloway Prison, which once housed the likes of Myra Hindley and Rose West. She was accused of stealing £11,503.28 - a number that seems to have been engraved into her memory - while working at Camberwell Green Post Office. Tracy, who was not one of the claimants in the case, says: ""Because I wouldn't say sorry, I got put in prison."" She had been away from work on holiday, and when she came back, ""there was no evidence of where the money had gone,"" she said. Without her knowing, Tracy's family had actually paid the money back in an effort to stop her going to jail - an effort which ultimately failed. While in jail, she saw a girl who had hanged herself. The after-effects for Tracy have been severe. Because of the conviction, she lost her job and her house. She is having counselling. 'Post Office needs to learn from this' Rubbina Shaheen is one of the sub-postmasters and postmistresses fighting to clear her name. She ran the Greenfields post office in Shrewsbury and was convicted and jailed in 2010. ""When he [the judge] said I'm going to prison, I was just totally devastated. I didn't know what to say, what to do, honestly."" Her husband, Mohamed Hami, said: ""As it is, there is a tension of balancing all this cash up, and having a discrepancy creates [a] total nightmare for her."" After Rubbina was sent to prison, Mohamed said: ""My concern more than anything was if she was being bullied - and she was on suicide watch."" They lost the Post Office, shop and home. Rubbina is not one of the 557 Post Office claimants, but is now hoping her conviction will be overturned. Rubbina adds: ""I hope we get justice for it, I hope we get an apology from the Post Office for what they've put us through, and learn from it, basically, most importantly, so other people don't suffer like we did.""",Seema Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010.
"By Joe MillerBusiness reporter, BBC News BlackRock director Jonathan Paul Burrows was caught by inspectors at Cannon Street station last year and admitted to avoiding the £21.50 fare from Stonegate in East Sussex. In total, Mr Burrows is believed to have dodged £42,550 in fares. The City watchdog said he ""demonstrated a lack of honesty and integrity"". ""Mr Burrows has admitted that, on a number of occasions, he deliberately and knowingly failed to purchase a valid ticket to cover his entire journey,"" the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said. ""As Mr Burrows held a senior position within the financial services industry and was an approved person, he should have been a role model for others and his conduct has fallen short of the standard expected for someone in his position,"" the organisation added. Mr Burrows avoided paying the full fare by boarding the London-bound train at Stonegate - a rural station with no barriers - without purchasing a ticket. On arriving in London, he went through the barriers at Cannon Street Station using an Oyster travel card, incurring a maximum fare of £7.20. 'I was foolish' Mr Burrows, who is now banned for life from working in any regulated financial industries, has since paid back the £42,550, plus £450 in legal costs. Reacting to the FCA's decision, he said: ""I have always recognised that what I did was foolish. I have apologised to all concerned and reiterate that apology publicly."" However he added that ""the size of the settlement [with Southeastern] could be said to have led to a distorted perception of the scale of my wrongdoing"". ""While I respect the FCA's decision today, I also regret it, coming as it did after a 20-year career in the City that was without blemish. ""I recognise that the FCA has on its plate more profound wrongdoing than mine in the financial services sector, and I am sorry that my case has taken up its time at this critical juncture for the future of the City and its reputation.""",A London hedge fund manager who regularly avoided buying a train ticket on his commute to the City has been banned from working in the financial services industry.
"The firm has blamed ""a number of individuals"" for the behaviour. Following the revelations, the company's shares are set to be kicked off the stock exchange. The news will be a blow for Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley, who owns a 19% stake in the firm. Goals said that, as the issues with the accounts stretch back nearly a decade, there was ""material uncertainty"" surrounding its historical financial statements. Deadline missed Dealing in the firm's shares was suspended in March when Goals revealed that ""substantial"" VAT errors were likely to cost it £12m. At the time, it said the blunder ""may have an impact on future profitability"", and it delayed the publication of its financial results for last year as it worked to revise them. It had until the end of September to release those results but now it expects to miss that deadline. ""The directors do not now believe this timeframe for the audit is achievable,"" the firm told shareholders. As a result Goals no longer expects its shares to resume trading. The listing of its shares on the AIM market is ""expected to cease and cancellation will be effective from 30 September 2019"". Goals, which has 45 pitches in the UK, said conversations were continuing with HMRC over its tax bill but revealed there had been ""no material developments"" in those talks. Nevertheless, it said UK sales had increased over 11% so far this year. They were up almost 15% in the US where it runs sites in California.

"It contracted by 0.2% compared with the previous three months, the government's statistical agency said. However, this was not as bad as the 0.5% contraction that economists had expected. The country, the seventh largest economy in the world, has seen economic growth fall sharply in recent years. The slowdown is partly a result of low commodity prices, sluggish global growth and low investor confidence. Higher interest rates and tax increases have also held back consumer spending, an important element of Brazil's economy. The better-than-expected figure was partly due to a rise in the agricultural sector which saw an increase in coffee prices. But that was offset by a fall in household consumption of 1.5%, the biggest drop since the credit crunch of 2008. Brazilians are struggling to pay back debt built up during the boom years, a struggle intensified by higher interest rates. Analysis: Daniel Gallas, South America business correspondent If Brazilian authorities are right in their forecast, 2015 will see the country's worst economic contraction since 1990, when the country was still experiencing hyperinflation. Planning minister Nelson Barbosa predicts a 1.2% drop in the GDP for 2015. Part of Brazil's current problems are self-inflicted. After three years of overspending, in an attempt to get the economy growing rapidly, President Dilma Rousseff has now moved towards austerity. Many sectors that received benefits - such as labour tax breaks - are now facing steeper costs. A weaker Brazilian currency has also contributed to higher inflation, which is predicted to rise above 8% - well beyond the government's 4.5% target. A new finance minister has a mission to get Brazil's economy growing in 2016 or 2017. But everyone accepts that 2015 will be a year of relatively high inflation and negative growth. The government has also reined back spending, and the figures showed a fall of 1.3% in government consumption. Scandal A massive corruption scandal at the state oil giant Petrobras has seen the firm cut back on investment to save money, causing thousands of workers to lose their jobs. Dozens of senior politicians and business leaders are implicated in the Petrobras scandal. Thousand of workers have felt its impact, with dozens of small firms laying off employees and leaving contracts unfulfilled. For example, one of Brazil's leading construction companies, Galvao, filed for bankruptcy after Petrobras stopped paying it for services. That meant a major road project Galvao was expected to complete has now been mothballed. Economists expect Brazil's economy to continue to shrink throughout the year. Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets research for TD Securities, said: ""The trend is for weaker growth going forward. ""Brazil is getting back into a recession.""","Brazil's economy shrank in the first quarter of the year as severe droughts held back growth, the country's statistics agency reported."
"Shares in the ride-sharing app dropped further below the $45 price they began trading at on Friday when the company made its stock market debut. Uber has begun trading as a public company just as the US and China have stepped up the level of trade tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2% on Monday. Since floating on Friday, Uber has seen $20.2bn wiped off its market valuation to $62.2bn as its share price dropped to $37.10. Analysts at Wedbush Securities said that Uber had clearly not had a ""storybook start"" as ""investors continue to grapple with the valuation of the tech transportation stalwart especially in the backdrop of a risk-off vibe on the heels of heightened US-China trade tensions and market choppiness"". On the wider market, US markets were hit by news that China plans to impose tariffs on $60bn (£46bn) of US goods from 1 June. The move comes in retaliation to the decision by President Donald Trump last week to more than double levies on $200bn worth of Chinese imports to 25%. Comment: Michelle Fleury, New York business correspondent After China hit back by raising tariffs on US goods, traders at the New York Stock Exchange were left scratching their heads. One put into words what many investors were feeling this morning as the trade war between the world's two largest economies escalated another notch: ""What happens after that? I have no clue."" And it's this uncertainty that has roiled US markets. Most here believed some sort of trade deal was in the offing, hence the knee jerk reaction now that its being called into question. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, summed up the mood on Wall Street this Monday: ""It seems this tit for tat, this political gamesmanship could get out of hand and I think as a result investors are worrying that it could have negative implications for the global economy."" Of course if a deal does come to pass, he believes the market losses would be recovered. But with the Trump administration preparing tariffs on a further $325bn worth of Chinese goods, investors are buckling up for a bumpy ride ahead. Mr Trump has also ordered the US trade department ""to begin the process of raising tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from China"", estimated to be valued at around $325bn. The S&P 500 share index was also down 2.4%, while the Nasdaq fell 3.4%.","Uber's share price has fallen another 11% amid wider stock market turmoil, as the trade war between the US and China escalates."
"By Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter Ofcom said that Openreach will become a distinct company with its own staff, management and strategy ""to serve all of its customers equally"". It must consult with customers such as Sky and TalkTalk on major investments. Ofcom boss Sharon White told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""we can now expect better service from Openreach"". Openreach controls the fibre connections, ducts and pipes behind the UK's broadband infrastructure and sells access to BT's rivals, such as TalkTalk and Sky. The regulator had threatened to force BT to legally separate Openreach. However, Ofcom said on Friday that the company had agreed to all of the changes needed to address its competition concerns. ""As a result, Ofcom will no longer need to impose these changes through regulation. The reforms have been designed to begin this year."" BT's rivals such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone, which use Openreach's network to offer broadband to consumers, have long complained of high charges, poor service and failure to invest in the division. Ms White called it a ""significant day"" for phone and broadband users and pledged to ""carefully monitor"" how the revamped Openreach performs. Sky welcomed the announcement: ""A more independent Openreach is a step towards delivering better service to customers and the investment that the UK needs. It's important that today's agreement is now implemented by BT in good faith and without delay."" Dido Harding, chief executive of TalkTalk, said: ""We hope this is the start of a new deal for Britain's broadband customers, who will be keen to see a clear timetable from Openreach setting out when their services will improve."" Vodafone said it is ""an encouraging start"". Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said: ""Now we need to see this deal implemented, along with significant improvements to Openreach's service standards, and increased investment by Openreach in the country's digital infrastructure."" BT chief executive Gavin Patterson said the deal, reached after two years of negotiations with Ofcom, meant Openreach would have its own board and make its own investment decisions. However, he admitted that BT would set the overall budget. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The BT board will set the annual budget. As the 100% shareholder, the owner of the company that's not unreasonable."" Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent It has been a lengthy, not to say tortuous, saga but now the battle over the future of BT - and the UK's broadband infrastructure - appears to be over. A legal separation of Openreach and BT may not satisfy those who feel the parent company should have been forced to sell the broadband division. But even fierce critics such as Sky and TalkTalk appear to be accepting that this is a more realistic option. A forced sell-off could have meant a lengthy legal battle that would not have done anything to speed up the rollout of superfast broadband at a crucial time. But will customers see any difference? The accusations had been that Openreach delivered a poor service, favoured BT over other suppliers and was pressured to deliver cash to fund the acquisition of expensive sports rights. That last charge was always denied by BT - but it accepts that it needs to do better when it comes to serving customers. Will an Openreach run by an independent board suddenly see an economic case for investing billions more in fast fibre broadband connections right into homes when BT did not? That seems doubtful. The other question is whether BT's shareholders will be happy to see a vital part of their company sail off on its own. They still own Openreach but have little control. Maybe they will end up feeling it would be better just to sell it off and say goodbye. Under the agreement, Openreach chief executive Clive Selley will report to its chairman, Mike McTighe. However, the boss will still have to report to Mr Patterson on legal, fiduciary and regulatory issues. BT's chief executive can veto the appointment of Openreach's boss, but only after notifying Ofcom. Openreach's 32,000 staff will transfer from BT to allow the new business to ""develop its own distinct organisational culture"". Mr Patterson said the agreement would end a ""period of uncertainty"" for staff. ""We have listened to criticism of our business and as a result are willing to make fundamental changes to the way Openreach will work in the future,"" he said. He also admitted that Openreach's service has ""not been where it needed to be"" and said the separation would improve the situation. The BT logo will also be removed from Openreach's branding. Shares in BT jumped 4.3% to 344.2p in morning trading in London. George Salmon at Hargreaves Lansdown said keeping Openreach as part of BT, but with its own board and brand, ""should put to bed any lingering concerns investors may have had over this potentially disruptive issue"".","BT has bowed to demands by the telecoms regulator Ofcom to legally separate Openreach, which runs the UK's broadband infrastructure."
"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter The Resolution Foundation said that while the UK's self-employed workforce had grown by 45% since 2001-02, their weekly earnings had fallen by £60. It blamed the rise of lower paid jobs and the financial crisis, which had reduced pay rates. The report comes as a ruling on a closely watched case on pay for self-employed drivers for Uber is expected. Adam Corlett, economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said that almost five million UK workers were self-employed - about one in seven workers and a record high. They included construction workers, hairdressers, taxi drivers, tutors and IT consultants, he said. ""But while the self-employed workforce is getting bigger, typical earnings are actually lower than they were 20 years ago,"" Mr Corlett said. According to the research, average self-employed wages were £240 a week in the 2014-15 financial year - the most recent period for which data is available - down from about £300 a week in 1994-95. The Resolution Foundation - a think tank that aims to improve pay for families - partly blamed the changing nature of the self-employed workforce. The foundation said that many more people had taken up lower-paid jobs in the so-called ""gig economy"", essentially self-employed workers taking on a variety of different roles, while the proportion of self-employed business owners with their own staff had fallen. The number of hours worked by the self-employed had also declined. It said this had limited wage growth before the financial crash, but that pay had been ""squeezed"" in real terms after 2006-7, falling £100 a week by 2013-14. ""While returns may have increased slightly in 2014-15, many workers are still feeling the painful effects of the financial crisis,"" Mr Corlett said. ""With so many self-employed workers earning so little, it is right the government investigate how public policy should catch up to meet the needs of these workers."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Britain's new generation of self-employed workers are not all the budding entrepreneurs ministers like to talk about. ""While some choose self-employment, many are forced into it because there is no alternative work. Self-employment today too often means low pay and fewer rights at work."" A Department for Business spokesperson said the government was ""committed to building an economy that works for everyone"". ""While the National Living Wage has given one million workers a pay rise, the Prime Minister has made clear the labour market must support and protect all workers,"" they said. ""That is why she has asked Matthew Taylor to lead a review of how changing employment practices affect job security, workplace rights and opportunities for progression."" Uber ruling Some companies have recently been accused of taking advantage of self-employed staff. Taxi app firm Uber is awaiting the outcome of a employment tribunal after two of its drivers claimed it was acting unlawfully by not paying holiday or sick pay. The US company says it has 40,000 drivers in the UK, so the result could have a significant impact on its costs. Meanwhile, takeaway delivery firm Deliveroo faced protests in August after saying it would pay its self-employed drivers per delivery, rather than on an hourly basis. The firm, which was also criticised by the Department for Business, soon backtracked and made the scheme optional.","Average wages for self-employed workers are lower than in 1994-95, researchers say."
"The changes affect the bonuses for 2011 of chief executive Bob Diamond and finance director Chris Lucas. At the moment, they are due to receive the bonuses in shares over three years. They have now agreed that they will only receive half of the award each year until certain targets for the bank have been met. Mr Diamond received a £1.35m salary and a £2.7m bonus for 2011, as well as £2.25m in long-term incentive payments. The £2.7m bonus is currently due to be paid at a rate of £900,000 a year over three years, but following the changes he may only receive half of that. The applicable bonus figure for Mr Lucas is £1.8m, or £600,000 a year. The target to be met is that the bank's return on equity must exceed its cost of equity, which are standard measures of the performance of banks. At the moment, Barclays' cost of equity is 11.5% and its return on equity is 6.6%, so Mr Diamond and Mr Lucas have some way to go before they become eligible for their full bonuses. Under the terms of the deal, if the target is not met until the third of the three years then Mr Diamond would receive his full £900,000 for that year as well as the £900,000 he had not been paid for the previous two years. But it is a rolling three-year deal, so if the target were not to be met until, for example, the fifth year, Mr Diamond would only be able to claw back bonuses foregone in the previous two years.","Barclays has changed its executive remuneration plans ahead of its shareholders' meeting, following pressure from investors."
"A report, commissioned by Labour, claims banks have distorted the economy by lending to ""unproductive sectors"". Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the current financial system was not delivering investment across the UK. The report said that moving areas of the Bank to the Midlands would help create a ""new economic policy hub"". It calculates that investment in UK manufacturing, high-tech companies and other ""critical sectors"" lags behind property by £28bn. Mr McDonnell said: ""Under the Tories, we've seen more and more investment flowing into property speculation whilst high-tech firms have been starved of the money they need, and research spending has lagged far behind."" The report states: ""As a central bank sitting at the heart of the UK financial system, the Bank of England needs to be playing an active, leading role, ensuring banks are helping UK companies to innovate."" Policy hub The report by GFC Economics and Clearpoint Corporation Management highlights that productive sectors are increasingly concentrated in a small part of the country. It says that there is a risk that ""the disproportionate number of technology companies in London and the South East will increase, exacerbating regional inequality"". It suggests relocating the National Investment Bank and the Strategic Investment Board secretariat and research department, both organisations which Labour said it will set up if it wins the next election, in Birmingham. It says with some of the Bank of England: ""All three, side-by-side, would constitute a new ""economic policy"" hub, possibly close to the main train station [Birmingham New Street]."" It adds: ""Restructuring core Bank of England responsibilities will help to provide a counterweight to the dominance of London."" The report also proposed establishing Bank of England offices in Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast, and two smaller regional offices in Newcastle and Plymouth. The Bank of England relies on 12 agencies across the UK to report on local business conditions. Birmingham, the UK's second-largest city, will become home to the HSBC's ring-fenced UK retail bank in January. Earlier this year, Andy Street, the former managing director of John Lewis, was elected as the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands. The Bank of England has been on Threadneedle Street since 1734 and occupies a site spanning 3.5 acres. The Bank declined to comment.",The old lady of Threadneedle Street may have to leave her home of 283 years under Labour plans to move large parts of the Bank of England to Birmingham.
"By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC News Following a drought summit with the National Farmers' Union (NFU), he said the government would do ""whatever it takes"" to maintain food supplies. The NFU had requested relief from the ""crippling impact"" of the heatwave, including the relaxation of rules over accessing additional water supplies. Mr Gove promised to remove bureaucracy where it was hindering farmers. ""We will make sure farmers have what they need in order to provide us with high-quality food and ensure their businesses survive,"" he said. The record summer heatwave has put huge pressure on farmers. Meat and milk producers, salad, fruit and vegetable growers, have said harvests and yields are being severely affected by some of the driest months since 1961. Heavy rain in recent days has given farmers some relief, but the NFU was still ""seeking urgent action"" to help farmers. NFU President Minette Batters said: ""Today's summit was a wake-up call to government and policy makers about the importance of British food production and the critical need to manage the volatility that comes with it. She welcomed Mr Gove's pledge to support the sector. At the meeting she had sought more flexibility for farmers who want to take water from rivers, or have increased access to the public supply water when there is spare capacity in the system. The Environment Agency, the government body which oversees water use, said farmers would be allowed some short-term flexibility within their water abstraction licences. ""We must also balance farmers' needs with those of wildlife and other water users so we will only allow these arrangements where we are satisfied there won't be any adverse effects on the environment,"" said Paul Hickey, the EA's head of water resources. Cows sent to slaughter early as drought hits Dairy farmer Abi Reader has already sent four milking cows to slaughter and she's planning to send four more as the cost of feeding them soars. For livestock farmers like her the lack of rain means animals can't just be put out to pasture as usual. Near Cardiff in Wales, where Abi Reader farms her 180-strong milking herd, grass is usually green and lush throughout the summer, she says, but the heat has dried it to a crisp yellow. It's costing her £210 a day to keep them fed using silage and hay. ""We're breaking into winter stocks, that's the frightening thing,"" she says. It doesn't make economic sense to feed so many. So they're ""shedding passengers"" - cutting down the number of mouths by sending cows to slaughter that would in better circumstances have continued milking. Two were cows that aborted calves due to the stress of the hot weather. ""We've lost a lot of money on them. The cheapest option is get rid of them and cut our losses,"" she says. Ms Reader says she's not the only farmer taking this course of action. It was hard to find a slot for them in abattoir, she says. John O'Farrell, who runs an abattoir in Camarthenshire, Wales, says many farmers are culling animals earlier than they would normally, following a bad grass growing season due to the harsh weather in March, which delayed the start of outdoor grazing, followed by the heatwave. ""Our volume of work is considerably higher than we would expect at this time of year,"" he told BBC Radio Four's Farming Today programme. ""Farmers are taking the view if the animals are to be culled it's best to cull early."" The same factors are having an impact on beef and sheep herds too, according to Nick Allen from the British Meat Processors Association. ""The first thing we noticed was people sending lambs in for slaughter at slightly lighter weights than normal,"" he says. ""The moment they're running out of grass on the farm they get rid of them earlier."" He says if farmers go into winter short of feed and relying on expensive concentrates it will push up costs and could result in lower overall production of UK meat and milk. ""It could translate into meat being in shorter supply and prices having to go up because the cost of production is going to have to go up, without a shadow of a doubt,"" he added.","The environment secretary, Michael Gove, has promised support for farmers hit by the impact of the dry weather."
"British firms clawed back a net £79.9bn worth of overseas investments in 2014. That compared with a £28.4bn incresase in overseas investments by UK firms a year earlier. Foreign firms also scaled back their investments in the UK. It is the first time UK companies have reduced net foreign direct investment in more than a decade, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Overall, the amount of money invested overseas by UK companies fell to £1.15trn in 2014 from £1.25trn in 2013. Foreign companies cut their direct investment into the UK to £27.8bn in 2014 from £33bn in 2013. The figures come after state visits to the UK by the leaders of two of the fastest-growing economies in the world - Chinese President Hu Jintao and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi - during which a number of trade deals were announced. The Institute of Directors (IoD) warned that the figures showed the UK could no longer rely on its investments abroad to compensate for ""weak export performance"", given the falling global demand. Chinese woes Commodity prices have fallen sharply in the last year amid fears that the Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, is slowing down too rapidly. This slowdown has reduced demand for metals and oil and contributed to deflation in the UK and the eurozone. Allie Renison, head of trade policy at the IoD, said some UK manufacturing firms were already selling off assets and facilities abroad and bringing production back to the UK. She added: ""We also shouldn't forget that the UK is still the leading destination in Europe for inward investment."" The figures come as activity in the UK's dominant services sector was shown to have jumped to a four-month high in November. The closely watched Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey for the services sector showed a reading of 55.9 in the month - the fastest rate of growth since July and an improvement on October's figure of 54.9. Any figure of above 50 indicates growth. New business orders also rose to a four-month high, with new contracts linked to new product launches and acquisitions. Companies also reported coming under salary pressures, linked to the government's introduction of the National Living Wage next April. And business sentiment was little changed from October's two-and-a-half-year low. The stronger services sector growth contrasted with earlier surveys, which showed manufacturing activity easing and expansion in the construction sector falling to a seven-month low.","UK firms cut their foreign investment by the largest amount in a decade last year, official figures have shown."
"The firm's sales grew 22% in the three months to 31 March, despite virus-related restrictions denting activity. The gain was stronger than expected, driven by demand for groceries, electronics and cloud computing. Supply chain disruptions and investment losses weighed on its results overall. The performance of China's economy - in which Alibaba is a key player - is being closely watched as a preview of how the rest of the world might fare following abrupt economic shutdowns aimed at controlling the spread of Covid-19. The country's government said this week that it would not set an economic growth target. This marks the first time it has declined to do so since 1990. Many global companies have also scrapped forecasts for the year ahead, citing uncertainty due to the pandemic. On Friday, Alibaba, which runs one of the world's largest groups of shopping and digital media websites, also warned of uncertainty. But it told investors that it expected revenue growth of about 27% over the next 12 months, compared to 35% in the prior year. ""Although the pandemic negatively impacted most of our domestic core commerce businesses starting in late January, we have seen steady recovery since March,"" Alibaba chief financial officer Maggie Wu said. International uncertainty Alibaba profits were, however, almost completely wiped out in the three months to 31 March. The company said this was largely down to a loss of investment income. The firm reported sales of $16bn (114.3bn yuan, £13.1bn) in the same period, with revenue on its core shopping websites up by almost 19%. Sales in the firm's cloud computing division jumped 58%. However its international businesses saw significantly slower growth. This branch includes Southeast Asia shopping website Lazada and account for about 7% of the firm's revenue. ""For our international commerce businesses... the timing and pace of recovery is still uncertain as demand in countries outside China remains soft,"" Alibaba said.","Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba said it has seen a ""steady recovery"" in the country since March, but warned that the path to an economic rebound remains uncertain."
"Remington Walden died after the Jeep in which he was travelling was struck from behind by a truck, which ruptured its rear fuel tank causing it to ignite.

The model Remington died in was built in 1999 and was therefore not among those recalled. Chrysler said that the 1999 model was not defective and dangerous. But jurors said the car giant was liable for the death and the company had failed to warn customers that the tank's position could increase the risk of a fire.

"German industrial output rose 4.6% in July despite concerns over the Ukraine crisis, Destatis said. The economy ministry figure was much higher than many economists had forecast, and comes after a 2.7% fall in output in June. Foreign orders made up the bulk of the rise in demand, the ministry added. Domestic orders increased 1.7% and foreign orders rose by 6.9% in the month. The rise in industrial orders contrasts with figures last month from the economy ministry showing that the economy shrank in the second quarter by 0.2%.

"By Jeremy HowellBusiness reporter, BBC News The rules will limit the way charities can contact people for donations and that could affect how much money they can raise. The EU's new data protection regulations that come into force in May 2018 say charities, along with other organisations, must have the ""express consent"" of members of the public before contacting them. This could mean that charities will have to ask everyone on their databases who has donated in the past whether they want to receive future requests for funds. It could also mean an end to widely used methods like cold calling and mass mailings. Losing money ""There are charities who are worried about how restrictive the rules might be,"" says Daniel Fluskey, head of policy and research at the Institute of Fundraising, a body which advises charities on how to raise revenue. ""We have charities saying: 'If this gets too restrictive we will lose contact with people. We won't be able to ask for money and our services will lose money.'"" The first charity in Britain to take action to comply with the new rules is the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, or RNLI. Based in Poole in Dorset, it runs lifeboats and volunteer crews around Britain's coastline and has an annual income of about £190m. This year it contacted 900,000 people on its database asking if they still want the RNLI to send them requests for donations. About 400,000 said yes, so from 1 January it will approach only these people to raise funds. ""Historically, the way charities have raised income is to go to the general public, to write to them to ask for income,"" says Tim Willett, the RNLI's head of fundraising. ""In the future, we will only be able to do that with people who have actively opted in to the RNLI's communications strategy. That reduces the number of people quite dramatically who we have the ability to speak to. ""We think that's opened up a gap in our income streams over the next five years of £36.5m."" For the RNLI, this means a loss of income of 5% a year. Smaller charities with a smaller number of past donors could be hit much harder. But the rules could also mean the donor and not the charity must make the first approach. ""The rules are slightly grey in that area,"" says Daniel Fluskey. ""The main thing is that whenever you are giving charities data, you have to be informed how it will be used. ""If you haven't been given a choice on how your information will be used - and given them your options - then you shouldn't be called."" The Information Commissioner is due to issue guidance in the new year on how the new rules should be interpreted. New methods The EU's regulations come in the wake of a series of media reports that some UK charity fundraisers had been buying up people's personal data, gleaned from the internet by specialist data-mining companies, and that they had focused particularly on elderly people who seemed to have large amounts of savings. Some people have been pestered with requests from dozens or even hundreds of charities. Parliament passed a new law in 2016 making charities more responsible for the methods used by their fundraising agents, and several are looking for new ways of raising money. The RNLI has been trialling a contactless charity box, so that people who may not have any cash on them can tap their debit cards on it to make a donation. Blue Cross, a charity for abandoned animals, has been raising contactless payments using a pet Labrador called Smudge, who has a contactless card reader in a coat on his body. Meanwhile, Amnesty International has developed virtual reality versions of its films showing its relief work in war-torn Syria. ""We began noticing in 2014 a drop-off in interest in Syria,"" says Kristyan Benedict, Amnesty International's crisis and tactical campaigns manager. ""We wanted to find a new way of communicating the horrors on the ground. With the virtual reality experience you are getting an immersive feel of what it is like, and it has a more emotional impact. ""For people under 25 virtual reality is not strange, it's normal. They see it as the logical next step in communicating."" ""I think charities know the direction things are going in,"" says the Institute of Fundraising's Daniel Fluskey. ""There has been a culture shift in fundraising. People are not just doing things because they've worked in the past, but making sure they are ethical and working to the values of their organisation."" The new EU regulations - combined with a shift to using new technologies - could mean that in the future we could be getting fewer cold calls and letters from charities dropping on the doormat.","Thousands of charities in the UK may have to rethink the way they raise money from the public, because of new EU regulations."
"The firm's accounts show compensation, for the firm's ""highest paid director"" rising to £265m including dividends. That was £48m higher than the total she received last year as the popularity of online gambling continues to grow. However the industry is facing mounting criticism for not doing enough to deal with problem gambling and addiction. The privately held company is owned jointly by Ms Coates and members of her direct family, including her brother John who is joint chief executive and her father Peter, the firm's chairman. Last year Ms Coates' pay and dividends were reported to total £217m. In the year to the end of March her basic pay rose from £199m to £220m. The firm paid out £90m in dividends in the same year, half of which are thought to have gone to Ms Coates, as the owner of half of Bet365's shares. Ms Coates earned a first class degree in econometrics - the application of statistical methods to economic data - from Sheffield University before joining the High Street betting firm, run by her father. She identified the potential of online gambling in 2000 and invested in the domain name Bet365.com so that she could drive the family business in that direction. Bet365, now the largest private sector employer in Stoke, has millions of customers worldwide. It offers sports betting, poker, casino, games, and bingo. The accounts showed that the firm's revenues grew by 25% in the year to the end of March and operating profit was up by 31%. Increasing criticism While the online gambling sector has ballooned in recent years, it has also come in for increasing criticism over its impact on some customers who have become addicted or accrued large debts. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson recently described gambling as a ""public health emergency"". Bet365 said it was continuing to develop strategies to identify gamblers at risk and to ""help customers bet responsibly"". However, Luke Hildyard, spokesman for the High Pay Centre, which campaigns against excessive executive remuneration, said ""betting companies are not exactly a force for good in the world"". ""There is an increasing perception that big business only serves the interests of an elite few - a billionaire taking hundreds of millions more from a company that profits, in part, from other people's addictions does nothing to dispel that perception,"" he said. Ms Coates, 51, lives in Cheshire with her husband, Richard Smith, who also serves as the firm's property director, and their children. The group owns Stoke City Football Club, which made a loss of £21m and in 2017 the group paid £75m into its charitable fund, set up in Ms Coates' name.","The UK's best-paid boss, co-founder of online gambling firm Bet365 Denise Coates, has received another bumper pay rise."
"Europe's highest court upheld a law that will standardise packaging and ban the advertising of e-cigarettes. The Court of Justice found the laws ""did not go beyond the limits of what is appropriate and necessary"". Under the new rules health warnings will have to cover 65% of the front and back of cigarette packaging. The rules are due to take effect from 20 May, but the new packets will not be on sale until stocks of existing cartons have been cleared over the next year. 'Disproportionate' Philip Morris International and British American Tobacco (BAT) challenged the proposed legislation. They argued that the European Union was overstepping its authority to direct laws in member states. Reacting to the court's findings a BAT spokesperson said: ""We stand by our belief that the Tobacco Products Directive is a clear example of the EU overstepping the limits of its authority. The reality is that many elements of the directive are disproportionate, distort competition, and fail to respect the autonomy of the Member States."" Individual EU states are also working on new packaging rules. In the UK, the government wants to introduce tobacco packs with plain packaging - a move which is also being challenged by big tobacco companies. The law was supposed to come into effect later this month, but that could be delayed as on 18 May the High Court is due to rule on the legal challenge to the legislation from the tobacco industry. Local battles ""What is clear from the [EU] directive and the judgment is that measures that go beyond the requirements of the directive, such as plain packaging, must still comply with the wider principles of EU and international law."" said the BAT spokesperson. ""Whether plain packaging meets these requirements is currently the subject of ongoing litigation before the English Courts and the WTO [World Trade Organization]. It is likely that the losing party would launch an appeal over the High Court's decision.","Rules that will drastically alter cigarette packaging are set to be adopted, after big tobacco firms failed to block new European Union laws."
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, Maryland But now he, like many other manufacturers in the US, is worried. In March, President Donald Trump announced steep tariffs on foreign steel and aluminium, citing the need to protect those industries. But the move has left hundreds of other firms, including Mr Huether's Independent Can Co, exposed. His firm, which employs more than 400 people and takes over $100m (£77m) in annual sales, relies on tin-plated steel from Europe and Canada to make specialty products such as biscuit tins and coffee cans. The tariffs are expected to add about $1.5m in surprise expense this year. And Mr Huether says they have already cost him one long-time customer, who turned to China amid the uncertainty. ""We need a strong steel industry - no question about it,"" he says. ""But I don't think they've thought through the ramifications."" To assuage business concerns, the Commerce Department said it would allow firms to apply for exemptions from the tariffs. The department rules on the request after a comment period, during which metal producers can object. Instead of calming debate, however, the procedure has triggered new turmoil, after companies overwhelmed the department with requests. About 800 businesses, including Independent Can, submitted more than 34,000 petitions, citing issues such as as quality flaws, delivery delays and lack of production in the US. As of 10 September, officials had decided on more than 4,300 of the requests, approving about 55%. But the majority of the applications are still pending, leaving Independent Can and many others in limbo. ""It's very frustrating. If we could buy domestic, we would buy everything domestic,"" says Mr Huether, who submitted more than 30 requests and estimates he has spent about $100,000 trying to navigate the process. ""We only went overseas because quality issues domestically forced us."" 'Can of worms' The decision lag has led to fierce lobbying and complaints from Republicans and Democrats alike about a lack of transparency and bureaucratic micromanagement. Nor has it escaped notice that many of the denials appear to be prompted by objections from steelmakers - an industry with close ties to the administration. For example, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross used to own steel companies, while the head of steelmaker Nucor advised Mr Trump during the 2016 presidential election. The Commerce Department has twice revised its process, bringing on more staff and expanding the opportunities for manufacturers to respond to the objections, but their frustration remains high. ""There's no criteria,"" says Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""So of course it opens up a huge can of worms and concerns that for anybody who gets [a waiver], it's favouritism or corruption or just not transparent."" 'Adjustment problem' US Steel, one of the firms that opposed Mr Huether's requests, declined to comment on how the administration is handling the process. But a company spokeswoman said its expansion plans - it has already restarted one blast furnace and is preparing to restart another - showed it had the ability to meet US demand. Peter Morici, an emeritus professor at the University of Maryland business school, says politicians are dramatising the problems ahead of US congressional elections in November. As US steel and aluminium makers boost capacity, the kinds of issues cited by manufacturers should subside, he adds. ""In the near term, there's an adjustment problem,"" Mr Morici says. ""In the longer term, there's no steel that we can't make here."" But many firms can't afford to wait, especially as the surging demand for US-made metals has led to higher prices, says Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, a pro-free market think tank housed at George Mason University, who has analysed the requests. ""Eventually this does come out of the bottom line of firms, of shareholders or of consumers. You can't escape it,"" she says. ""And small and medium-sized manufacturers are the ones that are feeling the brunt of this right now."" Companies in Missouri, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere have announced hundreds of layoffs already. Other firms have scaled back expansion plans or said they will shift work overseas. Independent Can raised prices in September, breaking with its custom of setting prices at the start of the year. It is looking to automate lower-skilled jobs, often filled by temporary workers, to reduce expenses. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Mr Huether says he's not optimistic about winning waivers, especially since the department denied some already after objections from steelmakers. He's hoping the administration will still work out a deal with allies, like Canada, but the odds of that happening quickly aren't great, says the Peterson Institute's Chad Bown. The trade deals that Mr Trump has renegotiated - such as the revised North American Free Trade Agreement - have left the tariffs in place, Mr Bown notes. Independent Can got its start in 1929 when a booming steel industry spawned a cluster of metal-related firms around the port in Baltimore - and is one of the few from that era still standing. Mr Huether, whose family took it over two decades later, says he shares Mr Trump's goal of reviving blue-collar work, but tariffs aren't the right tool. ""This isn't what they were trying to do,"" Mr Huether says. ""We're a casualty.""",Rick Huether's family has run a manufacturing company in Maryland since the 1940s. So he knows a bit about keeping blue-collar jobs in America.
"Mr Lundgren's starting annual salary was £740,000, while Ms McCall was on £706,000 when she left the budget airline in November. He was previously a deputy chief executive at travel group Tui. EasyJet was ""absolutely committed"" to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men, said Mr Lundgren. ""To show my personal commitment I have asked the board to reduce my pay to match that of Carolyn's when she was at EasyJet,"" he added. ""I also want to affirm my own commitment to address the gender imbalance in our pilot community which drives our overall gender pay gap."" Female pilots The gender pay gap in EasyJet is currently 51.7%, but the budget airline says this is not because of unequal pay for women. Salaries for pilots and cabin crew are collectively agreed with unions and both men and women are paid the same. The gender pay gap comes in because there are far fewer female pilots than male pilots in the industry as a whole - only 4% of commercial pilots are women, and only 5% of EasyJet's pilots are women. The budget carrier has set a target that 20% of new pilots should be female by 2020, up from 6% in 2015. Earlier this month, EasyJet reported a 14.4% jump in revenues to £1.1bn for the three months to 31 December, with passenger numbers up 8% to 18.8 million in the period.","EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren is reducing his salary by £34,000 to match that of his predecessor Carolyn McCall."
"By Padraig BeltonTechnology of Business reporter Dubai is racing to be the first to put drone taxis in the air. In June, its Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) signed an agreement with a German start-up Volocopter to test pilotless air taxis towards the end of this year. The firm has received 25m euros (£22m; $30m) from investors, including German motor manufacturer Daimler, to develop the 18-rotor craft capable of transporting two passengers at a time. The promotional video claims a top speed of 100km/h (60mph) and a maximum flight time of around 30 minutes, while nine independent battery systems ensure safety. ""You will never require"" the onboard emergency parachute, Volocopter assures us. Dubai's RTA has also teamed up with China's Ehang and is testing the drone maker's single passenger Ehang 184 ""autonomous aerial vehicle"". But the largest city in the United Arab Emirates faces stiff competition. It seems the whole world has gone gaga for air-cabs. In February, ride-sharing giant Uber poached Nasa chief technologist Mark Moore and set him to work heading their Project Elevate - ""a future of on-demand urban air transportation"". Airbus, the French aircraft maker, is also working on a prototype air taxi, Vahana, saying it will begin testing at the end of 2017 and have one ready by 2020. They all spy opportunities in the air because traffic is becoming increasingly clogged on the ground. To take an extreme example, in Brazil's Sao Paulo, the world's 10th richest city, traffic jams average 180km (112 miles) on Fridays, and sometimes stretch to a barely credible 295km. Yet the world's megalopolises are continuing to grow. No wonder air taxis are capturing people's imaginations. Ehang carries a single passenger, Volocopter two, while City Airbus is looking at four to six. And each of these companies is pursuing electric propulsion, seeing it as greener and quieter. The preferred horizontal rotor technology allows for vertical take off and landing, which makes sense in densely built up urban spaces. And composite materials, such as carbon fibre, help keep weight to a minimum. But how will they work in practice and will they be affordable? Uber's Mr Moore says the cost, with three or four passengers sharing a pool, will be ""very similar to what an UberX [car] costs today"". More seriously, given the trade-off between power and weight, how long will these things be able to stay up in the sky relying on battery power alone? Because if you don't like your mobile going flat, you definitely won't like it when your air taxi does. China's Ehang drone currently flies for 23 minutes. But US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates stipulate that aircraft require a spare 20 minutes of fuel. So this would limit the drone to a commercially unviable three-minute flight. ""It's really a problem,"" says Janina Frankel-Yoeli vice-president of Israel's Urban Aeronautics, a firm taking a manned, combustion-engine approach to air taxis instead. But Mr Moore argues that improvements in batteries are ""on the track we need for them to be there in 2023"", when Uber plans to have its first 50 air taxis ready. The vastly increased investment in electric cars around the world is improving recharging speeds and capacity, he says. ""We don't need long range - 60 miles covers the longest trip across a city."" So rapid recharging capability is more important than range, he argues. Another solution may involve a two-part drone, with the batteries stored in a detachable base that can be swapped quickly between flights, says Tim Robinson, editor of the Royal Aeronautical Society's magazine, Aerospace. ""If there was a drone waiting and it had a flat battery I'm pretty sure it wouldn't let you take off, whatever your journey was,"" he says. In other words, it's very unlikely that a sky taxi would run out of juice mid-flight. Once battery levels reached a critical point, the drone would make an emergency landing. ""I think we'll see multiple redundancy and back-up systems,"" says Mr Robinson, ""like a ballistic parachute which would trigger automatically if it detected a descent rate beyond the parameters."" Another major challenge is managing the airspace and avoiding collisions. Most major cities already have air corridors set up for helicopters that air taxis could use, Mr Moore says. But requesting to enter the corridors is currently done manually. More Technology of Business ""You'd fly to the edge of that airspace, request to enter, and maybe be told 'Nope, hold, wait',"" he says. So Nasa's NTX research centre is exploring how flight corridors can work without voice interactions. This includes improved ""sense-and-avoid"" technology that will allow drones to communicate with other passenger aircraft to avoid one other. But perhaps the biggest drag on sky taxi development is regulation. While commercial aircraft are already ""virtually capable of taking off, flying and landing on their own"", says Ms Frankel-Yoeli, the US FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency will not allow them to fly without a pilot. It may take a long time for autonomous drone tech to win regulatory - not to mention public - trust. And that's ignoring the potential complaints about the noise all these buzzing copters would make in our cities. Uber's Mr Moore believes air taxis will have autonomous capability built in from 2023, but will have human pilots for the first five-to-10 years while enough data is collected to convince regulators that sky taxis are safe. Meanwhile Dubai seems to be racing ahead, with ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum saying ""by 2030, 25% of the mass transportation in the city has to be autonomous"". But Dubai is a harsh aviation climate, where ""winds can go up to 40-50 knots [46-58mph], there's sand, there's fog"", warns Mark Martin, an aviation consultant working there. Perhaps Dubai is moving too quickly and should work more closely with the slower US and European regulators, he argues. ""If one crashes, who's ever going to take a drone?""","Tech companies are competing to develop the first viable passenger-carrying sky taxis, whether manned or pilotless, but how soon could these clever copters really be whizzing over our cities? And would you trust one?"
"The retailer, which also owns Waitrose, has launched a review of the business which it said would involve ""right sizing"" its stores across both brands. The review would involve store closures ""where necessary"" as well as space reduction in existing stores, it said. The conclusions of the review are expected to be announced in September. New chairwoman Sharon White - who took over last month - said the changes would kick-start a ""vital new phase"" for the partnership, and said she had ""no doubt"" the business would be stronger as a result. ""We need to reverse our profit decline and return to growth so that we can invest more in our customers and in our partners. ""This will require a transformation in how we operate as a partnership and could take three to five years to show results."" The group announced that three Waitrose stores would close later this year at Helensburgh, Four Oaks and Waterlooville as part of the overhaul. John Lewis also said as fears about coronavirus continued to spread, it had see increased demand ""particularly this week"" for some food items as well as things such as hand sanitiser, soap and loo roll. John Lewis's finance director, Patrick Lewis, said it was working ""very hard with suppliers on an hourly basis"" to keep up with demand. The John Lewis Partnership is owned by its staff - known as partners - who usually receive a bonus each year. This year, staff bonuses have been set at 2%, the lowest since 1953 when it paid no bonus. Profits at the partnership dived by 23% last year to £123m - the third year in a row that profits have fallen - as it continued to struggle with the slowdown in consumer spending. The John Lewis department stores saw ""significantly reduced profitability"" following weaker sales of home and electrical goods, although profits rose at Waitrose after a ""solid performance"", the company said. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the fall from grace for John Lewis had been ""spectacular"", and warned that if Ms White could not turn around the business ""the fallout could be much worse"". ""Once the envy of the retail industry, the company has suffered dismal trading performances over the past few years, demonstrating that the retail race is so fast that even those seemingly on an unstoppable march one year can be vulnerable the next. ""This goes to show that no retailer is safe."" Catherine Shuttleworth, the chief executive of retail analysts Savvy, said store closures appeared inevitable. ""I think the business is going to have to be slimmed down,"" she told the BBC. ""It's very difficult to close some of the department stores down because they're on really long leases, but certainly I think where there are opportunities to close stores that aren't performing they will look at that."" She added that Ms White did not have much time to turn the business around. ""She's talking about changes taking three-to-five years, I don't think there are three-to-five years in retail at the minute where there isn't going to be an enormous amount of change. She hasn't got that much time on her side. John Lewis have been 'strategically reviewing' things for quite a while - we need some action."" Retail analyst Richard Hyman told the BBC the firm's staff bonus scheme was an ""absolutely fundamental"" part of its ethos. ""The key competitive edge John Lewis has is customer service, that is delivered by its staff. If you take away part of their remuneration then your customer service levels are likely to be impacted. ""And I think that over the past few years as that bonus has gone down we've been seeing a bit of that. It's a really difficult dilemma they have.""",John Lewis has warned it could close shops as a plunge in profits forced it to cut staff bonuses to their lowest level in almost 70 years.
"By Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News Thorp still looks almost new; a giant structure of cavernous halls, deep blue-tinged cooling ponds and giant lifting cranes, imposing in fresh yellow paint. But now the complex process of decontaminating and dismantling begins. It is a dangerous job that will take decades to complete and require a great deal of engineering ingenuity and state-of-the-art technology - some of which hasn't even been invented yet. This is why. Five sieverts of radiation is considered a lethal dose for humans. Inside the Head End Shear Cave, where nuclear fuel rods were extracted from their casings and cut into pieces before being dissolved in heated nitric acid, the radiation level is 280 sieverts per hour. We can only peer through leaded glass more than a metre thick at the inside of the steel-lined cell, which gleams under eerie, yellow-tinged lighting. This is a place only robots can go. They will begin the first stage of decommissioning - the post-operative clean-out - removing machinery and debris. Already, a mechanical arm on wheels is being carefully guided through the cave, as operators shout instructions to each other, trying to prevent the machine becoming tangled up in cables. Once cleared, the cell will be washed repeatedly using water or acids to bring down the level of radioactivity. Ultimately, the plan is for humans to be able to enter the contaminated cave. ""We'll need to look at novel decontamination agents to help us clean out the plant more effectively,"" says Melanie Brownridge, head of technology at the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority. Thorp: A brief history ""That should help us remove more of the radioactivity early on, so that we can get on with the decommissioning job sooner."" Cleaning up other parts of the plant will also need robots and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Some will need to be developed from scratch, while others can be adapted from systems already used in other industries, such as oil and gas, car manufacturing and even the space sector. ""Some of these might be very small robots, able to change shape and go through small apertures into the facility,"" explains Ms Brownridge. ""Others might be quite large devices used as platforms to take technology inside - so there will be a whole range,"" she says. Sellafield, and the engineering companies it works with, already have a great deal of experience developing technology for use in a highly radioactive environment. The site in Cumbria contains a number of other redundant facilities, some dating back to the 1950s and many of them heavily contaminated, which are currently being decommissioned. A flying drone has been used to map radiation in inaccessible parts of the site, for example. Remote submarines have explored and begun cleaning up old storage ponds. Other remote machines are being used to take cameras deep inside decaying bunkers, filled with radioactive debris. The job of developing machines like these is shared with a large network of specialist companies, many of them based in Cumbria itself. They form part of a growing decommissioning industry within the UK, as the country grapples with the legacy of its first era of nuclear power. The NDA believes that these companies can use what they learn at Sellafield, and other plants, to attract further business from overseas. The drone mentioned above, for example, was developed by radiation-mapping specialists Createc and UAV company Blue Bear. It is is now being used inside a damaged reactor building at the Fukushima plant in Japan. In this, the NDA has a surprising ally. The environment group Greenpeace, which bitterly opposed the opening of Thorp, is enthusiastic about decommissioning. ""We do feel it's important that Sellafield confronts the decommissioning challenges that arise from Thorp's closure,"" says the organisation's policy director, Doug Parr. ""In fact there's a good case that people there can become world experts and world leaders in the decommissioning of nuclear power stations and other installations. We would support that."" The post-operative clean out at Thorp is due to take three years, but the entire decommissioning process will take decades. In the meantime, the plant will continue to serve a purpose. For the next few years, one of its ponds will be used to cool and store used nuclear fuel - though that fuel will not be reprocessed. Final demolition is expected to take place between 2075 and 2095, with the overall decommissioning bill forecast at £4bn at today's prices. More Technology of Business But that isn't the end of the matter. Thorp leaves behind thousands of steel canisters filled with a glassy mixture of high level wastes - the by-product of years of reprocessing. Their contents will remain intensely radioactive for thousands of years. Added to all this will be the wastes produced in the decommissioning process itself. They can be processed and packaged, in concrete and steel, but they cannot be destroyed. Ultimately, the government's policy is for intermediate and high level wastes - and potentially plutonium as well - to be stored within rock, hundreds of metres underground, in a so-called Geological Disposal Facility. But ""currently no sites have been selected or are under consideration"", the government says. So while the clean-up at Thorp will soon begin, its hazardous remains will stay in Sellafield long into the future.","The Thorp nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield, Cumbria, has recycled its final batch of reactor fuel. But it leaves behind a hugely toxic legacy for future generations to deal with. So how will it be made safe?"
"By Padraig BeltonBusiness reporter And it's also a robot. OSHbot, as it is called, measures roughly 5ft, and boasts a 3D scanner and touchscreen. ""It's not just robots for robots' sake, or a marketing gimmick,"" insists Kyl Nel, executive director of Lowe's Innovation Labs. Lowe's is an American DIY chain, and the robot's ultimate employer. A store associate, no matter how talented, couldn't know the real-time location and current stock levels of all of a shop's wares, according to Mr Nel. The 3D scanner connects with a database of thousands of small screws and hinges. Typical customers entering the store with a small part, he says, ""don't know what it's called - all they know is they need 20 of them."" Much of this could be done with a smartphone, although the scanner is more powerful than a mobile phone camera. But it is more natural to have someone to ask. ""It's another barrier if you have to download something. If you come into a store you're there for a reason, and you typically want it right away,"" Mr Nel says. At the moment there are only two of the robots, with variations being field tested. This includes whether the robots' voices should be male or female, electronic or human; whether they should have a face or not; and how fast they should move. ""But we didn't go to all that trouble to do one store in the Bay area,"" adds Mr Nel. Plays well with others OSHbot is ""a great example of where robotics are today in terms of their usefulness,"" says Rob Nail, chief executive of Singularity University, located in Nasa's Silicon Valley research park. They are built to perform very specific, fairly limited tasks. The key to a robot-to-human interface is that it is embodied, suggests Philip Solis, a robotics expert at ABI Research. ""You're moving towards something you can interact with more - you can ask it information, and it can respond to you."" As an example he points to Jibo, which is being developed by MIT professor Cynthia Breazeal, and billed as the ""world's first family robot"". Jibo does not move around, but can swivel, answer questions, read stories, and take group photographs. ""It's another form of user interface to the internet,"" says Mr Solis. Human interaction is likely to prove the most difficult thing to do well, argues Mr Nail, ""since we haven't had a lot of robots interacting with consumers."" OSHbot costs roughly $150,000 (£95,319, €120,200), Mr Solis estimates, though this unit cost would decrease as the market matures. By contrast, Jibo will enter the marketplace at the end of 2015 for $499 (£317, €400). Robotics components are becoming cheaper, and instead of the full onboard computer previously required to provide processing speed, personal robots now ""really just need smartphone guts"", says Mr Solis. The cost of robotics has moved from accessible only to big business, to affordable for small enterprise, meaning much more experimentation will take place, says Andra Keay, head of Silicon Valley Robotics, a non-profit industry group. She predicts gradual improvements to things we already have based on robotics technology. Help with the heavy lifting In this way Budgee, a robotic shopping trolley developed by Five Elements Robotics, might just become what we expect every shopping trolley to do. This robot is purely functional. Rather than replicating a human shop assistant, it follows shoppers with their goods in tow - particularly helpful for the elderly or those with limited mobility. On similar lines are the K5 and K10 robotic security guards being field tested by Knightscope - and in passing, possibly resembling a Dalek. They use similar technology to the Google self-driving car, can read 300 vehicle registration plates a minute, and summon police or security guards when they encounter evidence of intruders. Much of the biggest retail impact of robotics technologies will in fact be out of customers' eye. Amazon purchased Kiva Systems - which makes warehouse robots - in March 2012 for $775 million (£493 million, €620 million), and is using them in its warehouses. They're not alone - robotic pickers and packers are becoming a common sight in retail distribution centres. It's a very different approach to that of Aldebaran Robotics. Their humanoid Pepper robot was created for Japanese company Softbank, and it's more like the robot companions of science fiction. Pepper is designed to recognise human emotions, and to react to its environment based on information held in a continually evolving cloud database. It will go on sale in Japan in February 2015 for ¥198,000 ($1,900, £1,064, €1,434). Miss Keay thinks this is a difficult price point for its makers to pull off. ""When we're going for robots that are cheaper than $20,000-$50,000 (£12,700-31,777, €16,000-40,050), you're going to have a lot of tradeoffs in either durability, size, or functionality."" This is droid you're looking for How a robot looks could guide how we interact with technology in coming years. ""A voice in a headset saying turn left, now turn right feels a little too intimate, I think,"" says Mr Nail. ""But,"" he adds, ""it's not going to be humanoid, really it's not - when people try to make them look too human, it kind of creeps us out."" We're more likely to see robots like Jibo at the moment, thinks Miss Keay. ""You've basically taken out all the hardware problems, and made a physically embodied social interaction in a not very difficult piece of hardware,"" she says, ""Whereas producing a small humanoid that was affordable, it's just a little too complex for where we're at."" ""I really hope the novelty of the robot wears off quickly,"" says Singularity University's Rob Nail. He thinks robots with access to customer databases could recreate a time ""when the shopkeeper would know your name and preferences, and you'd have a tab with him."" In other words, rather than the sterile high tech environment often seen in science fiction, robots on the shop floor could bring back the personal service while shopping we associate more with the past, than the future.","A hardware store in San Jose has a new star employee.

"Faisal IslamEconomics editor@faisalislamon Twitter The OECD said that there needs to be a global agreement on technology company tax. Without such an agreement, there would be the risk of ""a cacophony"" with countries going their own way. The warning came as France agreed to delay a new tax on multinational technology firms after an angry response from Washington. The organisation charged with brokering a global compromise on an issue threatening a transatlantic trade war has said the UK should hold fire on its digital sales tax. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer arrived at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Secretary General Angel Gurria told the BBC that without a global solution to technology companies paying less than a fair share of tax, there would be a ""cacophony and a mess"" of 40 countries going their own way with ""tensions rising all over the place"". In regards to the UK plan to levy a 2% tax on the UK revenues of search engines, social media companies and online marketplaces from April, Gurria, said that the government should ""absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution"". Elsewhere at the World Economic Forum, there were indications that the French Government will delay its implementation of a tech tax to until the end of the year. What is the digital sales tax? The UK, France and several other European countries want to make sure that technology giants pay their ""fair share"" of tax in countries where they operate. These governments are concerned that technology giants - the largest of which are US companies - are avoiding taxes in the European Union. They argue taxes should be based on where digital activity takes place not where firms have their European headquarters. Italy, Austria and Turkey are also considering imposing new levies. Washington is opposed to the tax which it says unfairly targets US firms. However, Chancellor Sajid Javid has on Wednesday said the UK would push ahead with its digital tax, which could generate revenues of £500m a year. Mr Gurria is hosting a meeting between the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire and US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to confirm a ceasefire that should prevent a tit for tat trade war between the US and Europe. But Mr Mnuchin, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, warned other countries including the UK that ""they'll find themselves faced with President Trump's tariffs. We'll be having similar conversations with them"". However, tech companies are queuing up to say the tax system should change. Microsoft President Brad Smith told the BBC ""it does make sense for big tech companies to pay appropriate taxes"". And Apple chief executive Tim Cook in Ireland on Tuesday backed the OECD's effort to find a global solution. Officials preparing US-UK trade talks have expressed concern that the US would raise its objections to a UK digital sales tax in trade negotiations. The Treasury said: ""We've committed to introduce our Digital Services Tax from April 2020. It will be repealed once a global solution is in place"".","The UK has been told to ""hold fire"" on a new tax on big technology firms planned for April."
"The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) climbed to 3%, a level it last reached in April 2012, and up from 2.9% in August. The pick-up in inflation raises the likelihood of an increase in interest rates - currently 0.25% - next month. The figures are significant because state pension payments from April 2018 will rise in line with September's CPI. Under the ""triple lock"" guarantee, the basic state pension rises by a rate equal to September's CPI rate, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is the greatest. At the moment, the full new state pension is £159.55 per week, equivalent to £8,296.60 per year. Business rates will go up by September's Retail Prices Index (RPI) of 3.9%. The fall in the pound since last year's Brexit vote has been one factor behind the rise in the inflation rate, as the cost of imported goods has risen. ONS head of inflation Mike Prestwood said: ""Food prices and a range of transport costs helped to push up inflation in September. These effects were partly offset by clothing prices that rose less strongly than this time last year."" Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor Inflation has hit a five year high and is now 0.9% above the rate of wage growth - meaning that the incomes squeeze is becoming tighter. And if you are employed in the public sector - where pay rises are capped at 1% - or rely on benefits - which are frozen - that squeeze is even tighter. With poor economic growth figures and uncertainty over the Brexit process, the Bank of England's decision on whether to raise interest rates next month is finely balanced. Yes, ""price stability"" is the main purpose of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee which makes the decision. But many believe that inflation may now have peaked as the effects of sterling's depreciation following the referendum dissipate. An interest rate rise now, which increases prices for millions of mortgage holders and could dampen economic activity, could be just the medicine the economy doesn't need. The Bank of England is tasked with keeping CPI inflation at 2%, and last month its governor, Mark Carney, indicated interest rates could rise in the ""relatively near term"" if the economy continued on its current path. The governor of the Bank of England has to write a letter of explanation to the chancellor if the inflation rate is more than 1% either side of the 2% target. On Tuesday, Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee that ""inflation rising potentially above the 3% level in the coming months is something we have anticipated"", because of the fall in the value of the pound. He said he expected inflation to peak in October or November, and at that point he thought it would be ""more likely than not that I would be writing on behalf of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) a letter to the chancellor."" Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""The tick upwards in inflation will increase expectations of a rate rise from the Bank of England later on this year, stoked by a flurry of hawkish rhetoric coming from Threadneedle Street."" However, he added, it is not a foregone conclusion, ""so it's probably best not to count those chickens until they're hatched"". Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the Bank of England's policymakers ""should resist the temptation to raise interest rates, particularly during this period of heightened political uncertainty"". ""Raising rates before the UK economy is ready risks undermining consumer and business confidence, weakening the UK growth prospects further,"" he said. Analysis: Brian Milligan, personal finance reporter Pensioners will be celebrating again. Today's CPI inflation figure means they will get a 3% rise next April, their largest pension increase for six years. Those on the new state pension will see their weekly income rise to £164. Compare that to workers, who've seen their earnings rise by 2.1% over the last year. This is all thanks to the triple lock, which sees the state pension rise by the highest of earnings, prices or 2.5%. Food for thought for the chancellor, perhaps, who's reported to be considering tax concessions for younger people in his forthcoming budget, to even-up the inter-generational unfairness that the triple lock has contributed to. The 2.5% element of the triple lock is due to be dropped in 2021.","The UK's key inflation rate hit its highest for more than five years in September, driven up by increases in transport and food prices."
"At the same time, 2.3 million male workers will benefit, the Resolution Foundation report says. The majority of employees would see their earnings rise in line with the minimum but some would gain from a ""ripple effect"" of wage rises, it said. The National Living Wage of £7.20 an hour comes into force in April 2016. It will only apply to workers over the age of 25. The national minimum wage is currently £6.50 an hour, which will rise to £6.70 next month. ""Because of their concentration among the low paid, women will account for the majority of the winners,"" said the think tank's policy analyst, Conor D'Arcy. ""This will have a positive - though modest - effect on the gender pay gap, and will particularly help those working part-time."" Regional effect Analysis by the Resolution Foundation found that six million people - almost a quarter of all employees - will get a wage rise by the end of the decade, worth an average of £1,210. A further 2.8 million employees already being paid the new minimum would gain as firms maintained pay gaps between different workers, the report said. Workers in areas including Yorkshire and the Humber, Midlands and Wales were expected to be among those benefiting most from the higher wage, it suggested. Earlier in the week, the government outlined plans for tougher penalties to be imposed on employers which fail to meet the National Living Wage requirements. The plan for the wage, outlined in Chancellor George Osborne's Budget, has received support, but the CBI said it was a ""gamble"" to place politics into the setting of a minimum wage level. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The TUC has long argued that Britain needs a pay rise, and the new supplement to the minimum wage is a welcome step forward. ""Despite the pay gains, many of the lowest paid workers will still be left poorer overall because of steep cuts to their tax credits.""","Some 3.7 million women - nearly three in 10 employees - will receive a pay rise by 2020 owing to the new National Living Wage, research suggests."
"The fine is the maximum allowed by US law. GM said it had already begun reviewing its processes and policies to avoid future delays to recalls of this nature. To date, the firm has recalled 2.6 million cars with the defective switch, which has been linked to 13 deaths. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Board (NHTSA) said it was the single highest civil penalty ever levied as a result of a recall investigation. ""Safety is our top priority, and today's announcement puts all manufacturers on notice that they will be held accountable if they fail to quickly report and address safety-related defects,"" said US Transportation Secretary Fox in a statement announcing the fine. As a result of the settlement, GM has also agreed to provide NHTSA with access to the results of its internal investigation as well as to speed up its process for determining when to recall vehicles. ""We have learned a great deal from this recall [and] we will emerge from this situation a stronger company"" said GM chief executive Mary Barra in a statement. Thirteen deaths GM was fined for not reporting a problem with ignition switches in its Chevrolet Cobalt and other models. The faulty switches prevented the airbags from working and have been linked to at least 13 deaths in the US. The NHTSA received reports in 2007 and in 2010 about the problems with the switches, but each time it ""determined it lacked the data necessary to open a formal investigation"". Both GM and the agency have been criticised by customers for their slow response to investigating safety concerns. US car manufacturers are required to report safety defects within five days of discovering them. In April, Ms Barra testified in front of Congress and said she was ""deeply sorry"" over the company's handling of the defect. Last month, the company revealed it had taken a $1.3bn hit to cover the cost of the recall. However, it has asked a judge to ban cases ""alleging purely economic damages"" due to the recall, and has argued it is not responsible for problems with cars manufactured before 2009, when it was bailed out by the US government. Problems with GM's vehicles date back to at least 2004.",US car manufacturer General Motors has been fined $35m(£20.8m) for delays in recalling small cars with faulty ignition switches.
"It comes a week after the LSE confirmed it was in merger talks with Germany's Deutsche Boerse. In a statement, ICE said no approach had been made to the LSE board, and there could be no certainty that an offer would be made. LSE shares jumped 7% on the news. Under UK merger rules, ICE must now make or announce an offer for the LSE no later than 29 March. Third time lucky? Last week, the LSE confirmed it was in ""detailed discussions"" with Deutsche Boerse about a ""merger of equals"". Both companies said all their key businesses would continue to operate under their current brand names. It is the third time the LSE and Deutsche Boerse have tried to strike a deal, with the first attempt in 2000 then another in 2004-05. Under the terms of the latest plan, the LSE would own 45.6% of the merged group and Deutsche Boerse would hold the remaining 54.4%.

"In their annual reports, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group said they will pay their chief executives nearly £1m each in shares this year on top of their salaries and bonuses. The move sidesteps EU rules which limit bonuses to 100% of annual salaries, or 200% with shareholder approval. The rules, opposed by banks and the UK government, came into force in January. Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is set to be paid £900,000 in shares this year, on top of a base salary that was £1.1m last year, plus bonuses and a long-term incentive scheme that could bring his total pay to £7.8m for 2014. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins is set to be paid £950,000 in shares in quarterly instalments over the year. He may pick up as much as £6.3m over the course of 2014. Last week HSBC announced similar plans to award its chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, £1.7m in shares in response to the EU rules. Those rules are being challenged by Chancellor George Osborne in the European courts, amid fears that limiting bankers' pay could threaten London's position as a leading global financial centre. The report from Lloyds confirmed that the state-backed bank would ask shareholders - including the UK government- to back plans to allow bonuses of up to 200% of salaries. It said its remuneration committee ""strongly believes in pay for performance, in providing a competitive package that allows us to attract and retain the key talent."" In February the bank reported a pre-tax profit of £415m for the first time since its £20.5bn taxpayer bailout. Meanwhile Mr Jenkins wrote in Barclays' report to defend last year's 10% increase in the bonus pool. ""Whilst this [increase] is up 10% on the final 2012 incentive pool,... it is down 18% on 2012 and remains 32% below the pool level in 2010."" He told the Telegraph newspaper increased bonus payout were essential to prevent a ""death spiral"" of staff leaving. The news that UK banks were working around EU rules provoked anger from some European figures. Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian Green MEP who helped devise the bonus cap, said it was clear the UK government was failing to implement EU law and accused the coalition of having no interest in halting ""absurd remuneration packages"". He has urged the European Commission to take the UK to court over the issue.",Two UK banks are handing out massive share awards to senior executives amid EU limits on bonuses.
"By Lizzy McNeill & Sachin CrokerMore or Less, BBC Radio 4 How much is a thing worth? An ounce of gold? A kilogram of apples? A share in Apple? One simple way of answering that question is to say that it's worth whatever its price may be in a financial market. But sometimes prices go too high and inflate what is called a speculative bubble. The fictional financier, Gordon Gekko, in the movie Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, described ""the greatest bubble story of all time"". ""Back in the 1600s the Dutch got speculation fever to the point that you could buy a beautiful house on the canal in Amsterdam for the price of one bulb,"" he said. ""Then it collapsed,"" he added. ""People got wiped out."" The enduring power of so-called Tulip Mania means it still gets trotted out in 2018 when people talk about Bitcoin, which reached a record high last November, but has since fluctuated in value. Those who are sceptical of the digital currency feel that the dizzying rise in the price of something with no intrinsic value has all the hallmarks of the tulip bubble. But modern research suggests we've misunderstood the tulip trade. It wasn't speculative fever but cultural factors that made people value the flower. ""After you grow a white tulip for nine years or so, suddenly it will become striped or speckled,"" says Anne Goldgar, professor of early-modern European history at King's College London. ""This is because of a disease, but people were not aware of that at the time. ""You didn't really know what was going to happen with your tulips and people loved the fact that they constantly were changing."" In the 17th Century tulips - originally cultivated in the Ottoman Empire - were a new arrival in the Netherlands and their changing colours made them a hot product for the aesthetically attuned. Wealthy Dutch people were keen to show off their high-class taste. ""There were a lot of people who had money to spend,"" says Prof Goldgar. ""The same people who bought paintings tended to be the people who bought tulips."" Prof Goldgar says that while some flowers saw prices as high as 5,000 guilders - the cost of a nice house - these were very rare. ""I found only 37 people who spent more than 400 guilders on flowers at any point at that time."" Four-hundred guilders might not buy a house, but that was still more than the yearly salary of an unskilled labourer. 'Canal drownings' Tulips saw a massive increase in prices at the end of 1636, lasting until they plummeted on 6 and 7 February 1637. Prof Goldgar says the crash was probably caused by unsustainability, and fears of oversupply. But the effect wasn't nearly as bad as the story suggests. ""I looked to try and find anybody that was made bankrupt, because this is the myth of course that people were drowning themselves in canals because they were made bankrupt,"" she says. ""Actually I couldn't find anybody that was bankrupt because of Tulip Mania."" No one drowned themselves in the canals. But that doesn't mean the bursting of the tulip bubble didn't cause some issues. ""Bulbs stay in the ground for almost the entire year and so the only time you can exchange the bulbs is between late May and August when you can dig them up,"" says Prof Goldgar. ""The problem was that the rest of the time people were buying bulbs that they didn't receive until June - and they didn't pay for them until then either. So there were lots of people during the period of the crash who bought them but never paid for them."" But overall, Prof Goldgar says, the Dutch economy was not affected. Railway bubble So why is the speculative story so well known? Tulip Mania was popularised by an account written by the 19th-Century Scottish writer Charles Mackay, who loved a juicy story. He's not taken seriously as a historian, but his vivid tales have caught on. Ironically, Mackay himself was caught up in a bone-fide financial mania: the British railway bubble of the 1840s, which some scholars regard as the biggest technology bubble in history, followed by one of the biggest financial crashes. That, surely, is a lesson for us all: it's very easy to scoff at past bubbles, and even to exaggerate the stupidity of those caught up in them. But it is not so easy to know how to react when one may - or may not - be involved in one. More or Less is broadcast on BBC World Service at 19:50 GMT on Sunday 13 May. It will also be available on BBC iPlayer and here.",In the 17th Century the Dutch went mad trading tulip bulbs in the hope they could make a massive profit. But was Tulip Mania - a parable of greed compared to the recent heavy investment in the Bitcoin crypto-currency - really so awful?

"The company invests heavily in science research and development in the UK and has sites across the country - leading to fears that a takeover by US drugs giant Pfizer would negatively impact the UK economy. But, somewhat ironically, AstraZeneca's history is a labyrinthine list of mergers, dating back to the late 19th Century. 1800s: AstraZeneca's earliest roots can be traced to several companies founded in the late 1800s. Nobel Industries was founded in 1870 by Swedish chemist and industrialist Alfred Nobel for the production of the new explosive dynamite. It later diversified into the production of blasting gelatin and ballistite, which was a precursor of cordite, an explosive used in weaponry. Chemical manufacturing firm Brunner Mond was formed in Cheshire as a partnership in 1873 (becoming a limited company in 1881) by John Brunner and Ludwig Mond. United Alkali was formed in 1890 when 48 chemical companies from the Tyne, Scotland, Ireland and Lancashire merged. 1910s: Meanwhile, in 1913 Astra AB was founded in Sodertalje, Sweden, as an international pharmaceutical group engaged in the research, development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. 1926: In 1926 Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was formed by the merger of British Dyestuffs Corporation, United Alkali, Brunner Mond and Nobel Industries. The plan for the new company was agreed on board the Cunard vessel Aquitania on a voyage from New York to Southampton. The architects of the merger were Sir Harry McGowan, chief executive of Nobel Industries and Sir Alfred Mond, later Lord Melchett, chairman of Brunner, Mond & Company, who became the first ICI chairman. 1990s: In 1993 ICI hived off its chemical and pharmaceutical business as part of a planned demerger, calling it Zeneca. In 1999 Zeneca merged with Swedish pharmaceuticals firm Astra.","Although AstraZeneca is often referred to as a UK company, the pharmaceutical giant operates in more than 100 countries, and manufactures drugs in 16 places around the globe. The 15-year-old firm employs almost 52,000 people - 6,700 in the UK - and made a pre-tax profit of $3.3bn (£2bn) in 2013."
"By Anthony ReubenBusiness reporter, BBC News The ice-cream maker certainly does not appear to have abandoned the principles of its founders. Ben & Jerry's publicly supported the Occupy Wall Street movement and, according to co-founder Jerry Greenfield, nobody got fired. ""I am pleased that Ben & Jerry's is able to continue its innovative mission,"" he says. ""We get a lot of support - sometimes I'm a little surprised at how supportive Unilever is."" Jerry is currently judging a competition for entrepreneurs trying to set up sustainable businesses. 'Tipping point' Twelve years ago, the ideas of sustainability and corporate social responsibility seemed a lot more innovative than they do today. Many companies now have such programmes, and Unilever itself launched its Sustainable Living Plan in November 2010 which is supposed to halve the environmental impact of its products while doubling sales over the next 10 years. ""I think Ben & Jerry's was a tipping point for Unilever - they learned a lot from the culture and learned that it made business sense,"" says Paula Widdowson, former head of social responsibility at Northern Foods who is now a consultant on the subject. ""It was the tipping point, but they were already going in that direction, and now they have a fantastic sustainability statement - they've realised it's the next battleground."" Jerry Greenfield is more modest about the effect his ice cream business had on its giant owners. ""I don't know that I would say that Ben & Jerry's is a big influence on Unilever - Ben & Jerry's is like a flea on the back of this giant thing,"" he says. 'Lip service' It is hard to distinguish any effect that the acquisition may have had from the way that the whole of the business world has gone over the past dozen years. ""Most big companies are either looking at it or doing it,"" says Paula Widdowson, adding that the first areas looked at by companies are energy, waste and packaging because those tend to be the easiest ways to save money. ""Over the last 12 years, it's gone from lip service into practical application - anybody who is just paying lip service today is immediately caught out."" Jerry Greenfield says he doesn't care why companies are launching such programmes. ""Some companies may feel like they need to do it because they're getting pressured by consumers, but for whatever reason they're doing it, it makes me happy. I don't care if they're doing it to look good or to make their wives happy or whatever - it's a good thing."" He says that the next step is to bring social responsibility into everything a business does. ""It's easy to think of making money and then you give some away and you're a good company,"" he says. ""But the real power of a business is is in how it conducts its everyday operations and integrating environmental concerns right in the day-to-day activities: how you source your ingredients, your banking relationships, your marketing, all these activities."" Perhaps in another 12 years that will be a mainstream idea as well.","When Unilever bought Ben & Jerry's ice cream in 2000, there was talk of Unilever becoming more like Ben & Jerry's and not the other way round."
"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News The restructuring is likely to take the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which typically sees a retailer closing stores and renegotiating rents to prevent it from going into administration. It comes after the maternity specialist slashed its profit forecast in January and entered talks with creditors to avoid breaching the terms of its loans. So what went wrong at the 57-year-old chain, and can it turn its fortunes around? 1) Rising competition Stephen Springham, head of retail research at property consultancy Knight Frank, has been following Mothercare's progress for 20 years. He says even in the late 1990s the brand wasn't doing particularly well. ""What's changed is the UK baby goods market has become much more competitive,"" he says. ""A host of other firms are offering products at lower prices and Mothercare's range feels a bit outdated."" When it comes to childrenswear Mothercare faces stiff competition from supermarkets that sell their own lines, such as Asda through its George range and Tesco through F&F. Fashion retailers Primark and H&M also now have popular babywear ranges, while Amazon and Argos dominate the toys market. 2) 'It lost touch with mums' This is partly why Mothercare's sales have fallen every year since 2012. But the retailer could have done more to help itself, says Kate Hardcastle, retail consultant at Insight with Passion. The mother-of-three was keen to use the chain after she gave birth a few years ago, but says she had a bad experience. ""New parents want advice and support - whether they are buying a baby-grow for the first time or a bottle - and their sales assistants just weren't trained. ""I also had a wider buggy for two children and I couldn't get it around the stores. I was really disappointed and I've talked to hundreds of other mothers who feel the same."" She blames wave after wave of cost cutting at Mothercare over the last decade as it tried to remain competitive. She believes it could have adapted and thrived anyway, because of its strong legacy brand, but instead it ""let go of what made it special"". 3) Too many stores Like other High Street retailers that have got into trouble recently, Mothercare expanded at a rapid rate during better days but now has too many underperforming stores. Over the last four years it has reduced its store portfolio from 200 outlets to 137, but it's still struggling to pay its rents. ""It has a lot of legacy stores which it signed up to on 25-year leases during the good times,"" Mr Springham says, ""but those sorts of agreements aren't easy to get out of."" Mothercare's rescue deal could go some way towards fixing these problems, he says, but the future will remain bleak if it can't fix its underlying issues. 4) Online issues Some say the firm also needs to improve its online offering in the face of competition not just from Amazon, but also new internet marketplaces dedicated to baby goods. Ms Hinton says: ""There's also so much opportunity to recycle nursery products online now, be it on Ebay or Facebook, which is a lot cheaper."" Mothercare has been trying focus on e-commerce to offset falling footfall in its stores, and online now accounts for about 40% of its UK sales. But over the crucial Christmas period last year, online sales actually fell by 6.9%, despite heavy discounting in its end-of-season sale. The firm blamed technical issues which resulted in orders being delayed, and online revenue has since picked up. But Mr Springham fears the Christmas issues were symptomatic of deeper problems. ""You can say it's a blip but in this day and age that shouldn't be happening during your peak trading period."" Ms Hardcastle also thinks it raises red flags. ""Online is time sensitive. Mothers need a new cot or a rocker quickly, and in a market where you can get things on time from the likes of Amazon they were seeing delays."" You may also like:",Baby goods retailer Mothercare says it is finalising a rescue deal with its creditors after years of falling sales and profits.
"The chain made underlying pre-tax profits of £374m in the year to 4 February, £37m higher than in 2016. Like-for-like sales, which strip out stores open for less than a year, were 2.8% higher excluding fuel. The retailer said performance was strong despite the ""challenges"" of higher import costs. Revenues rose £1bn to £17.3bn and chairman Andrew Higginson said Morrisons was now entering its third consecutive year of growth. However, by the close of trading in London, its shares were 4.86% lower. ETX Capital analyst Neil Wilson said there was a ""sense that this kind of growth will be difficult to maintain, but this has been the argument for some time and has continually been wrong"". Morrisons announced a special dividend of 4p per share, which the firm said reflected its good progress and expectations for continued growth. One of the chain's priorities is to become more competitive. At Christmas, it said a basket of key items was the same price as the same time last year despite higher costs. Last month, Morrisons announced it would cut 1,500 middle management jobs. 'Bumper growth' Laith Khalaf, a Hargreaves Lansdown analyst, said the supermarket's largely UK supply chain had helped to ""keep prices competitive, in a market where the falling pound has increased the cost of imported food"". Although margins had slipped slightly, he said rising sales had helped bolster the bottom line, with the higher profits attributed to lower borrowing costs. Mr Khalaf added: ""Morrisons is carving out a place in the winner's camp. On top of improved performance in its retail outlets, the group is also laying the foundations of a wholesale business, with deals in place to supply McColl's newsagents, as well as the expanding Amazon Prime grocery offering.""","Morrisons, the UK's fourth-biggest supermarket, said annual profits jumped 11% as its turnaround programme continues."
"By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York By the time veteran UPS driver Thomas ""Tommy"" Chu leaves work, he will have picked up and delivered hundreds of packages in New York City, making some 16 stops an hour as his company hurries to meet the online shopping rush. But what may be his most impressive feat of the day precedes that scramble: at precisely 10:02 am, Mr Chu snags a parking spot. This is no small victory in midtown Manhattan, where one survey found truck drivers can spend as long as 60 minutes circling for a space. Often, drivers simply give up and risk a ticket. ""Most times, you have no choice. If there's no parking, you have to double park,"" Mr Chu says. Double-parked trucks, red brake lights and cardboard boxes littering the sidewalk: this is what the growth of online shopping looks like on the ground in America's largest city - and not just here. Parcel volumes surged almost 50% globally between 2014-2016, according to estimates from Pitney Bowes. They are on track to increase at rates of 17-28% annually up to 2021. The rising numbers of deliveries are adding to concerns about traffic and pollution in rapidly growing cities around the world. Forced rethink In Europe and Asia, cities have barred deliveries during certain hours, built warehouses to centralise distribution and provided millions in funding to encourage firms to switch to quieter, greener equipment. In the US, where the car has been king and the revival of dense city centres is relatively recent, discussions about how to handle the glut of online shipments were somewhat slower to start. But they're happening now. ""They've been forced to think more about it in cities because that's where we see the coming together of these pressures in a real, urgent way,"" says Professor Anne Goodchild, director of University of Washington's Supply Chain Transportation and Logistics Center. ""There's been a recognition at the municipal level that this has to now be what we plan for."" Online sales in the US remain a relatively small slice of total retail trade - about 10%, compared to roughly 15% in China, 17% in the UK and 18% in South Korea. But they are growing fast, and are on track to increase about 16% this year. Mr Chu, 49, started at UPS in 1990. He has watched as deliveries - mainly residential - have grown, as companies such as Amazon push to make near-instant home delivery the norm and as shopping habits change. When he started, he says, ""Nobody ordered water. Now, they order everything."" Environmental stress Companies are investing heavily to meet demand, spending billions on new facilities and aircraft, increasing weekend hours, and installing new technology to speed shipments to customers. Start-ups such as Deliv are getting in on the game and during the busy holiday season, firms employ thousands of seasonal workers to help cope. On a recent weekday, it took Mr Chu roughly 30 minutes on truck-jammed streets to travel from the UPS hub to his first stop, an office skyscraper near Bryant Park, about 1.5 miles away. Once parked, he spent almost two hours dropping off packages in that building. And he was not the only courier at work: staff from FedEx and the US Postal Service also sped through the hallways. ""That's a lot of stress on the environment,"" says Jose Holguin-Veras, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, who has studied freight deliveries in New York. Company solutions Firms are experimenting with ways to make deliveries more efficient, and bring down costs. They have embraced ideas like lockers, rolled out eBikes in select locations, and pushed for people to collect items in stores. Amazon has even started selling a smart lock, which will allow couriers to let themselves inside homes to drop off packages, reducing failed deliveries. But Prof Holguin-Veras says the issues accompanying increasing home deliveries won't be solved by the private sector alone. ""The problem is simply too complex. It's too tough to be solved by a single sector,"" he says. This autumn, in response to the increasing congestion, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a test ban on deliveries during commuter hours on some of the city's most crowded streets. The city's Department of Transportation wants to get 900 businesses to shift deliveries to off-peak hours - currently there are 400 participants. ""Our challenge is really to figure out how to make the system work efficiently,"" says Diniece Peters, from New York City's transport department. Different solutions Cities in Europe have taken other kinds of steps. Paris, for example, has sponsored logistics hubs, while one of London's bus operators is looking at the possibility of using buses for parcel delivery. In the US, where deliveries have become increasingly privatised, it will be tough to import some of the ideas being embraced overseas, says Prof Goodchild, who is studying urban deliveries with a group of city officials and private companies in Seattle. Their work is focused on cutting back on the number of failed trips and reducing the time couriers spend inside buildings, among other efforts. ""There's a different background. I also argue there's a different set of solutions because of that,"" she says. Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A major factor shaping the efforts is new technology. Right now, deliveries are expensive, especially as firms such as Amazon opt to shield consumers from the costs. Analysts expect that some day soon, companies will deploy robots for indoor deliveries, harness drones for remote drop-offs and enlist fleets of quiet, electric-powered driverless cars to make deliveries at night. City leaders are following the developments closely, says Stefan Knupfer, a senior partner at McKinsey, who has worked on reports about mobility initiatives and collaborated with a network of cities known as the C40. ""For all of us, this is a little bit of the beginning of a revolution,"" he says. Where next? Will the technological advances help cities resolve their current traffic and pollution problems? The jury is still out. As stores close due to online competition, that could reduce consumer trips and commercial deliveries and help alleviate traffic. But online retailers have also started investing more in bricks-and-mortar spaces, while other research suggests that people do not simply substitute clicks for trips. ""Right now, we have a lot of congestion... but when this automation transition takes place, and when the retailers start to close more and more stores, it's going to be very interesting,"" says Professor Jean-Paul Rodrigue, of New York's Hofstra University. He expects companies such as Amazon to stop subsidising delivery costs, switching to a range of price options for customers. For now, however, the effects of surging demand are clear. As Mr Chu turns a corner in New York, he passes a skyscraper under construction that will add hundreds of new apartments to the area. His prediction? ""When this building finishes, they'll need another truck.""",Online shopping is skyrocketing. So what are cities going to do about it?
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter, BBC News Employers are obliged to pay in as well, with the government adding a little extra through tax relief. The system - called automatic enrolment - started at the beginning of October 2012 with staff who work for the biggest businesses, with others being signed up over the following six years. Those who already save in a workplace pension scheme or are self-employed will not be signed up. Experts and ministers say it is vital people make a start at an early stage in their working lives, to eventually have savings that will top up the state pension. So who will automatically be enrolled into a workplace pension scheme? A workplace pension is a saving scheme for retirement organised through an employer. The employer may have their own scheme, offer one from a specialist pension provider, or use a government-backed scheme. Under the new system, those who work in the UK, are aged over 22 and under the state pension age, are not already in a scheme, and earn more than £8,105 a year will automatically be enrolled. Part-time workers who earn less than that can ask to take part if they want to and, if they earn more than £5,564, their employer will be obliged to make a contribution too. Those aged under 22, or over state pension age and still working, can also opt-in in the same way. Do I have to take part? No. You may decide that you need all of your monthly pay to make ends meet or you have a private pension policy you think is sufficient. Staff will be given a letter about the scheme when it starts at their workplace. This will explain who the pension provider is. Workers can ask this provider for an opt-out form. If they fill it in within a month, then their involvement will be cancelled. If they take longer, then they will start to build up a very small pension pot. This will still exist when the opt-out is processed, but it will just sit there untouched until retirement. It is worth remembering that by opting out, workers will miss out on the contribution their employer puts into the pension. In the majority of cases, they simply will not get these payments in any other way, such as in their regular pay. Those who opt out will also be enrolled again every three years by an employer, or after three months at a new job, at which point they will need to complete the opt-out process again. When will this system start? It will be introduced gradually over six years. The first wave has begun, with the largest businesses - with more than 120,000 staff - starting first. As time goes on, smaller firms will start enrolling staff. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) estimates that 380,000 workers will be signed up in October, a total of 420,000 will be enrolled by the end of November, and 600,000 will be in place by the end of the year. Firms with fewer than 50 workers will not start enrolling their staff until June 2015 at the earliest. But even the smallest employer - such as a plumber employing a full-time assistant - will eventually be obliged by law to enrol staff. The Pensions Regulator is policing the system to ensure workers are enrolled at the correct time. How much will I save? At first, an employee will only see a minimum of 0.8% of their earnings going to their workplace pension. Their employer will be obliged to add a contribution that is the equivalent of 1% of the worker's earnings. Tax relief adds another 0.2%. However, these amounts will increase to a minimum of a 4% contribution from the employee, 3% from the employer, and 1% in tax relief from October 2018. This means the equivalent of 8% of a worker's earnings (including overtime, but excluding any earnings over £42,275) will go into their pension pot. That means that from October 2018, somebody earning £20,000 a year would see £96.24 going into their pension pot every month. For this, some £48.12 will be taken from their take-home pay. They will not be able to get at the funds until the age of 55 at the earliest so, in the meantime, the money is invested. The pension firm, insurance company, or government-backed organisation that is running the scheme will give each worker a choice on how risky they want these investments to be. There will also be options for people to choose Sharia-compliant, or ethical funds. There will be a default option. This generally starts very safely, tries to make a bigger return during a worker's middle age, then plays safe again as he or she approaches retirement. There will be a charge levied by the pension provider, which is taken automatically each year from the pot. It is very difficult to predict what sort of pension somebody would have at the end of the process, owing to the impact of the success of investments, changes to people's earnings and the age at which they decide to retire. However, as a ballpark figure, a 30-year-old who earns £20,000 now, sees a 1% above inflation pay rise each year, makes the minimum contributions permitted, whose investments have a small but regular return and who retires at 70 may receive a pension each year of £2,100 at today's prices. ""For many people this will not be enough [in retirement],"" says Malcolm McLean, a consultant for Barnett Waddingham. However, he says it will be good for people to get into the savings habit, as they may also choose to have parallel savings for retirement. Has this automatic enrolment system been used in other countries? A number of countries have implemented schemes aimed at encouraging saving for a pension - many of which have mandatory participation. The KiwiSaver in New Zealand is the closest relation to the new UK scheme. A large number of people remain in the system, owing in part to government incentives, clear communication when it was launched and beneficial tax rules, according to a report for the DWP. Many of the schemes around the world have been introduced in the past 20 years, and - with the exception of the KiwiSaver - there has been little done to review how successful the schemes have been so far.",Millions of workers in the UK will gradually see a slice of their pay packet being automatically diverted to a savings pot for their pension.
"UK banks have reserved £16bn to compensate customers sold unnecessary or irrelevant insurance, with Lloyds setting aside more than any other. The bank, still part-owned by the taxpayer, made the announcement as it reported its third-quarter results. Shares in Lloyds fell by 3.5% as markets opened. Its profits for the nine months to the end of September were £1.69bn. Chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said: ""We are well on our way to becoming a better, simpler, low-risk bank, which delivers the products our customers need and the strong performance and sustainable returns our shareholders expect."" Dividends The charge for PPI had an impact on the third-quarter profit figure and helped to leave Lloyds with a loss of £440 million for the three months to the end of September. The group also put the loss down to a £330m charge against losses incurred selling its German life insurer Heidelberger Leben, to meet tougher regulatory requirements, in August. The government sold £3bn of its stake in the bank in September, and still retains more than a third of the company. It offered big investors 6% of Lloyds. US demand for the shares was reportedly high, with stronger than expected interest from institutional investors. Singapore government-owned Temasek also reportedly bought a large amount of the Lloyds shares, around 0.5% of the total. During Lloyds' bailout in 2008, the government bought shares at an average price of 73.6p and injected £20.5bn in total into the bank. TSB The group also announced it was talking to regulators about starting to pay dividends again, for the first time since 2008. The average market price at the time was 61p, so the government booked the difference as a loss and added it to the national debt. Lloyds stopped making a loss earlier this year, with first half-year profits of £2.1bn. It recently revived the TSB brand and has transferred five million accounts to the new bank, which started operating a month ago. The new bank will be sold off next year, as part of a process ordered by the European Commission to provide greater competition.","Lloyds Bank says it will set aside another £750m for compensation for mis-sold personal protection insurance (PPI), taking the total to £8bn."
"By Michael MillarBusiness reporter, BBC News ""Everything is interconnected in one way or another so it's a beautiful playground to be in."" He stresses he now only carries out ""White Hat"" attacks, probing new technology to find its flaws so they can be corrected by the manufacturer. But experience has taught him businesses can be an easy target. ""It's not easy to catch a hacker - if you go after governments there is a good chance you are going to get caught, but with businesses it's easier. ""They are often protected by insurance and it's very rare to see them going after a hacker for stealing their money, although with intellectual property it can be different,"" he adds. Denial A recent survey of 1,900 small businesses around the globe by internet security firm Symantec found the firms were plainly aware of cyber threats. They singled out specific problems like targeted attacks, keystroke logging, and the dangers of using smartphones for company business. But the Threat Awareness Survey also showed a considerable apathy towards security, with half of respondents replying they didn't feel in danger because they were a small company. Instead they thought it was large enterprises that should worry about security threats. This might account for the fact three out of five of the small businesses said they didn't use anti-virus technology on all their desktops, while two out of three failed to secure machines used for online banking. Unfortunately the evidence is not on their side: Symantec's research shows that since the beginning of 2010, 40% of all targeted attacks have been directed at small and medium-sized businesses, compared to only 28% directed at large companies. ""Hackers are going after 'low hanging fruits', these are the companies who are less security aware and do not have the proper defenses in place,"" says Ross Walker, Symantec's director of small business. ""Hackers are increasingly targeting smaller, softer, less reactive targets since these provide a lower-risk alternative to financial institutions."" The targets Such criminals could be after a whole host of things, such as data they can sell on the cyber-underground (credit card numbers, employee details and login details are particular favourites). They might upload malware to your site that attacks your visitors without you even knowing about it, or they might take control of your server, from where they can attack third parties. With small firms often having to deal with a lack of budget, inadequate security policies and a general lack of knowledge of the subject, all sorts of weak points can be exploited. ""Examples might be the development of websites and customer portal type applications, adoption of cloud computing services, allowing employees to bring their own mobile devices and laptops into work to use for work purposes - even just buying IT systems and storage solutions,"" says Piers Wilson from PricewaterhouseCooper's information security team. ""Maybe it will have staff who are disaffected or maybe it has highly valuable intellectual property rights - small companies often spring up around a simple idea, which may or may not be well protected,"" he adds. Since the explosion in mobile working a small firm's staff all need to be security guards, but some are plainly asleep on the job. For example, recent research of 1,000 SMEs by IT consultancy Modis, found 20% of staff regularly sent confidential business information using unsecured wi-fi hotspots - a hacker's dream come true. Vigilant staff But the risk your own staff might pose to your firm's security, even unwittingly, is not restricted to the inappropriate use of new technology. ""People are the weakest link at any level of security,"" says the hacker. ""You can attack a business from anywhere - even through the mail room. ""For example, you can send them marketing material - perhaps with a CD attached that they put into their computer and then you're in. ""You can make an enquiry of their accountancy department and as soon as you've got a name and email address you can send an email with an attachment, which they open because they recognise you,"" he says. ""Often you even say thank you for their help in the email."" Use protection Small firms wanting to protect themselves need to start by tackling a couple of issues, says David James, managing director of risk management specialists, Ascentor. ""These fall into two categories: understanding what and where your valuable data is and then doing something to protect it,"" he says. Mr James says 80% of attacks can be thwarted by doing the basics, including having strong passwords and regularly changing them - and not having them written on a sticky note under the keyboard or on the monitor, of course. Other key steps include installing anti-virus software and keeping it up to date, as well as restricting your valuable information to only those that need it (that means keeping your children off your work computer and limiting admin rights). Other good security measures include working behind a firewall and considering encryption, regardless of where the data is stored, be it on a laptop, smartphone, tablet, USB drive or even a humble CD. Then there is making sure your software has had the latest updates, or ""patches"". It might be nigh-on impossible to stop a determined cyber attacker from doing your business some kind of damage. But you can make it as difficult and frustrating as possible, which might well send them off looking for easier prey.","""Small businesses are fair game, it all depends what they have to offer,"" says the hacker."
"Full-time warehouse workers in the UK and the US will receive £300 or $300, with £150 or $150 for part-time staff. The money, $500m in total, will go to staff working between 1-31 December. The firm, run by Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, praised staff for ""serving customers' essential needs"" during the pandemic. In a blog post, Dave Clark, senior vice president of Amazon Worldwide Operations, wrote: ""I'm grateful to our teams who continue to play a vital role serving their communities. ""As we head into the peak of the holiday season, we want to share our appreciation through another special recognition bonus, totalling more than $500 million for our front-line employees."" The firm has come under intense scrutiny for working practices in its warehouses during the coronavirus pandemic. Labour activists in the US, for example, recently called on big retailers like Amazon and Walmart to do more to protect workers as surging Covid-19 cases coincide with the holiday shopping rush. They are calling for hazard pay, paid sick leave and better communication about outbreaks. Amazon workers have raised concerns about their health and working conditions in Europe as well as in the US, claiming it is almost impossible to practice social distancing. Black Friday protests Earlier this year, Amazon was forced to shut down several warehouses in France in an ongoing row over conditions. The company has previously said that its guidelines are adequate and that it provides employees with face masks. However, the company said in a statement that it ""provides some of the most advanced workplaces of their kind in the world, with industry-leading pay, processes and systems to ensure the wellbeing and safety of all employees"". Amazon said it had introduced additional cleaning and other safety measures to increase protection, and in the UK had started a pilot scheme offering voluntary Covid testing for employees. The retail giant has been one of the retail winners during coronavirus lockdowns as online deliveries skyrocketed when High Street shops closed. Sales will also be boosted during the Black Friday bonanza, although a coalition of trade unions, environmentalists and other activists have urged consumers to boycott the firm. Protests are being planned in several countries, and in Germany, the trade union Verdi has organised three-day strikes at Amazon warehouses, Sales at the internet giant shot to $96.1bn in the three months to 30 September - up 37% from the same period in 2019. And profits hit a record $6.3bn, nearly three times last year's total. But that level of growth has not come without additional costs. Amazon said it had $2.5bn in Covid-related expenses. In the UK it has also had to create thousands of jobs, as well as 20,000 seasonal posts, in a bid to keep up with shoppers.",Amazon is spending hundreds of millions of dollars on bonuses for Christmas staff after sales at the online giant soared during the pandemic.
"In the year to April 2018, the gap for full-time workers was 8.6% - down from 9.1% in the previous year. In other words, the average female employee now earns 8.6% less than the average man. However, campaigners said the rate of improvement was too slow and was a missed opportunity for the economy. The extent of the pay gap varies according to age, with older female workers much more likely to be underpaid in comparison. The ONS said the pay gap for those under the age of 39 was now insignificant and was narrowing ""markedly"" for those between the ages of 40 and 49. However, pressure groups said the change was happening far too gradually. ""This is a practically static picture on pay inequality,"" said Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns on gender rights. ""This slow rate of progress means without significant action, women starting work today and in decades to come will spend their entire working lives earning less than men."" The TUC said that the current rate of progress meant that it would take another 55 years for men and women to achieve pay parity. In the 22-29 age group, women earn just 1.3% less than men. However, in the 50-59 year-old group, women earn as much as 15.5% less than men. ""Millennials appear to be leading the charge, with younger men and women edging towards pay parity,"" said Laura Suter, personal finance specialist at AJ Bell. ""We now need to see this cohort of women encouraged to progress through to senior management roles. Focus should also turn to addressing the larger pay gaps that persist for older employees."" Pay The ONS figures also show that the average full-time employee in the UK enjoyed a 3.5% pay increase in the year to April, the biggest rise since 2008. Median gross weekly earnings reached £569, up from £550 in 2017. However, when inflation is taken into account, the rise was only 1.2% on the previous year. Those in ""continuous"" employment did better than the average, as did those in lower-paid occupations. ""Average weekly pay for full-time employees is now increasing at its fastest since the financial crisis, in cash terms, with hourly pay rising fastest among lower-paid occupations,"" said the ONS's Roger Smith. ""However, after taking account of inflation, earnings are still only where they were in 2011 and have not yet returned to pre-downturn levels.""","The gender pay gap has fallen to its lowest level yet, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported."
"By Martin WebberBusiness editor, BBC World Service Commodity prices tumbled, with oil and copper both down by more than 30%. The upside was that many consumers all over the world found some basic necessities became noticeably cheaper. The downside was severe pain for mine workers, mining companies and countries like Russia and Brazil, that had previously been feasting on the wealth generated by a five year commodities boom. The main raw material of steel, iron ore, saw some of the steepest declines. It has fallen by 80% from its peak four years ago. It was a price tumble that none of the experts had forecast - and it is all down to China. Engine stalls Over the past two decades, China became the manufacturing hub for the planet and an engine of global growth. But in 2015, it stopped devouring all the metals the world could produce. Even on official figures, China's growth has now dipped below 7% - that's less than in its big Asian rival, India. But many believe China's slowdown is actually much more dramatic than that. Gordon Chang, author of the 2001 book, The Coming Collapse of China, argues that growth in China was actually 3% at most in 2015. ""China's leaders no longer have the ability to prevent the economy from tumbling down,"" he says. Mr Chang says the levels of net capital outflow from China - set to reach a record $500bn (£335bn) this year, according to the Institute of International Finance - signal a lack of confidence in the Chinese leadership. Interest rate moves have been ineffective and a dramatic recent increase in government spending hasn't helped much either, he argues. ""The leadership is now without tools"", and he maintains that reform efforts have ""gone backwards"", with increased state intervention in the economy. Policy problems However, Jonathan Fenby from the Trusted Sources research group is less pessimistic, saying the authorities still have room to act. ""I think they've still got enough ammunition to avoid a real collapse,"" he says. ""But there will undoubtedly be a slowing down at least for the next two years."" The Chinese leadership under President Xi Jinping is ""very risk averse"" and ""doesn't seem to be able to get to grips with a lot of the problems facing it,"" he says. And while corruption is rightly being addressed, Mr Fenby says that unfortunately they are not using the regular justice system. Instead Beijing is working through the ""non-transparent Communist Party police"", creating a ""fear factor"" with many officials holding back on projects that might help stimulate the economy. Mr Fenby is also worried that the authorities will set a target growth rate for the next few years that is too high and which can only be achieved by increasing borrowing from its already excessive levels. Miners cut jobs The past year's shortfall in Chinese demand has provoked dramatic job cuts and closures by the global mining giants. Anglo American said it would close or sell up to 35 mines with 85,000 jobs going, while Glencore laid off thousands of workers in its Zambian copper mines and elsewhere. It was a truly extraordinary year for the oil markets, with the oil producers' cartel Opec, deciding not to adopt its usual tactic of restricting supplies to boost crude prices. Prof Ken Rogoff, of Harvard University, tells me the aim of OPEC's most powerful producer, Saudi Arabia, is to prevent any further loss of global market share. Saudi Arabia is under pressure from a burgeoning population and its venture into Yemen, he argues. It is ""hoping that by allowing the price to stay low for a long time, it can drive out marginal producers, especially those in the United States shale space,"" he says. Refugee challenge In Europe, headlines were dominated by a huge influx of refugees from warzones in Syria and neighbouring countries. The European Union was torn between a desire to give refuge to people in desperate need and the fear that an apparent ""open-door"" policy would simply overwhelm the continent with people looking for better economic opportunities. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel saw her popularity plummet after her apparently welcoming policy to migrants and refugees led to the flow to turn into a torrent. Around a million people seeking asylum arrived in Germany alone during 2015. At her party's annual conference in December she said the world was dealing with the biggest flight of refugees since the Second World War. ""That is a historic test for Europe,"" she told delegates. ""I would like, we would like, Europe to pass this historic test"". Some experts argue that Europe is actually in need of new young workers to counter an ageing native population. But Hans Werner Sinn of Germany's IFO Institute told the BBC that he didn't think the impact of mass migration would be positive. ""Don't expect too much - they are low skilled people. We will have to lower the minimum wage to generate more jobs for them."" Greece's euro crisis Europe also had to face another crisis back in July, as Greece seemed poised to be the first country to exit the common European currency, the euro. In a referendum, Greek voters decided to reject an austerity plan that Europe had negotiated in return for lending Greece more cash. Capital controls were imposed and Greeks started to queue at cash machines. In the end the Greek parliament gave in and said yes to more austerity, much to the disgust of many Greeks. Greece remains heavily in debt and it is far from clear that a long term solution has been found to the country's problems. In December, talks in Paris aimed at averting disastrous changes to the planet's climate were generally hailed as a success, with new promises by leaders to get tough on pollution. But what's really happening in practice isn't always what it seems. Emissions scandal Volkswagen was hit by scandal when it was revealed that many of its diesel engines were much dirtier than it had claimed. Indeed, it admitted that it had deliberately written software to make its engines perform differently on the road than during tests. The firm's global boss had to resign and - at one point - it seemed the damage to the reputation of the engineering prowess of VW might be severe. It estimated costs of more than $7bn. However, sales of VW vehicles have held up pretty well, with customers apparently deciding that the safety record and reliability of the cars were more important than its emissions deceptions. VW seems set to remain one of the world's top two car makers. And if more people are encouraged to drive more thanks to low oil prices, the worst may well be over for the iconic German business.

"Analysts had been expecting the firm to make a profit, but instead it lost 16bn reais ($4.8bn; £3.86bn). Petrobras said low oil prices had forced it to cut the value of oil fields and other assets. The firm is restructuring under new management after a corruption scandal battered the company's finances last year. The shake-up has been welcomed by investors, with Petrobras shares almost trebling in value on the Brazilian stock market since January. Analysis: Daniel Gallas, South America business correspondent Last month, Petrobras' CEO Pedro Parente told me the company would be back to its best days in five years time. He is moving fast with his downsizing plan, cutting 10% of staff and a launching a major sale of Petrobras assets. But Thursday's numbers suggest the path to recovery will be a long one. Analysts had predicted around $400m in profits for the third quarter but instead it registered about ten times that value in losses. And more difficulties are yet to come. The company still needs to settle more corruption-related cases in US courts and find buyers willing to pay good prices for its assets, all at a time when global oil players are not doing well. Petrobras said that without having to cut the value of assets it could have made a profit. ""The message we want to convey is that these impairments are non-recurring, and that we don't expect them to happen, not at least in this magnitude, in the coming future,"" said chief financial officer Ivan Monteiro. Scaling down The company's performance was also hit by the cost of a voluntary redundancy scheme, as well as court disputes in the US. Petrobras has been scaling down by selling off assets and pulling out of certain sectors. Meanwhile Brazil's government is reforming the oil sector so that it does not have to depend too much on Petrobras. Earlier this week, Brazil's Congress gave its final approval to a new bill that paves the way for foreign companies to explore lucrative new fields, without Petrobras having to hold a mandatory stake in them. On Thursday, Shell announced plans to spend $10bn in Brazil over the course of five years. ""This was a good move by the government and it will open up opportunities for more players to invest in Brazil,"" Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said.",Brazil's state oil giant Petrobras has reported a massive loss for the third quarter of its financial year.
"Almost half of local authorities reduced their support for buses in 2013 and some may remove all support next year, the study says. It adds that next year will be ""very difficult"" as many local authorities have deferred cuts to next year to allow for public consultations. The campaign gathered data from local councils in England and Wales. It found a net reduction of £10m in spending on subsidies for bus services in England in the 2013-14 financial year. 'Watershed moment' The campaign's report also showed that since 2011, as many as 264 bus services have been cut or withdrawn in England. Of those, 147 cuts were made in the current financial year. ""Cuts to bus services are now reaching critical levels,"" said Martin Abrams, from the Campaign for Better Transport. ""This is a watershed moment. If government doesn't take action to help support buses we will see whole networks disappear."" The report highlights many individual authorities that have made cutbacks. It says that Worcestershire and Cumbria county councils are consulting on plans to cut their entire budget for supporting bus services. The report adds that Essex County Council has plans to reduce its support by 30%. Government response In September, official data showed there were 70 million fewer journeys on England's buses last year, a fall of 1.4%. Stripping out London, where bus travel has been booming for years, the decline was higher, at 2.5%. At the time, Transport minister Norman Baker said: ""The government spends well over £1bn per year on concessionary travel and other support for buses every year. ""We are protecting bus subsidy and targeting it where it is needed most as well as making significant new funding available for bus improvements. ""The Department for Transport strongly supports bus travel.

"By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter ""I was just mum,"" says Samar Small, looking back to life before lockdown. Her family didn't give a second thought to what she did day to day. Samar is a manager at Royal Mail, responsible for a range of things, including communicating with bulk buyers of stamps (like the supermarkets), mail redirection services, and overseeing Santa Mail, planning for which commences in May. She usually works out of the Cardiff Mail Centre with colleagues hot-desking around her. Since March she has swapped that for the kitchen table in her three-bedroom semi, with her husband and two teenagers milling around, picking up snippets of conversations involving big projects and huge sums of money. ""They hear the figures being bandied round: 'What about that £2m?' It's not what they expected,"" she says. Her husband Stephen goes into work at weekends, in a role at Royal Mail that she used to do herself, so she has a good grasp of what he's doing. But it's the first time he's had much insight into what she does all day. ""I'm probably a bit brainier than he thought I was - dare I say it!"" she says. ""It's been a bit of an eye-opener,"" admits Stephen. There are the stacks of spreadsheets, all the financial accounting acronyms, and the hours and hours on the phone to everyone from suppliers to senior managers. He's been ""blown away"", he says, by just how professional she is all round, her confidence in challenging other people's plans if she sees a flaw, and her eloquence and firmness in meetings. 'No clue' ""Most of us find that we get to know somebody perfectly well, and can love and live with them, and still not know what they do,"" says psychologist and executive coach Sue Firth. ""It's quite revelatory to see what your other half does."" Discovering more will often reinforce mutual respect, she says, including when parents with jobs find out just how much work it takes to keep the house and children in order. The learning curve has been steeper for some than others. ""Kirsty"" from Sheffield estimates her police officer husband knew ""pretty much zero"" about her job as a financial consultant before lockdown. (She didn't want us to use her real name because of her husband's profession.) ""He had no clue. He struggled to tell people what I did,"" she says. More than anything, he's staggered by the level of responsibility she has, and the sheer volume of work on her plate. ""[Before lockdown] he never understood why I was working so late. He probably thought I was hanging out having a drink,"" says Kirsty. Now her husband sees her working 12-hour days. As for her, she can't help but get a lot more insight into his work, when every few minutes his police control centre radio is crackling into life. Having a husband who is in the police means she's already a bit ""hardened"" to what she hears, but the call-outs for suspected suicides are still always awful to hear and much more frequent than she expected. He's a detective constable, so has to collate files of evidence for the Crown Prosecution Service. That means sitting on a laptop and liaising with colleagues on video calls like the rest of us. There's a lot of paperwork, but there's the added pressure of dealing with people and events that are often shocking and unpleasant. Kirsty admires the way he remains professional no matter what, and feels she's getting a more realistic idea of what it is like to work on the frontline. ""People don't realise how busy they are,"" she says. ""The stuff he has to see, to deal with day in, day out."" 'Who even are you?' Working from home means we're not just learning about what our other half does for a living, but how they go about it, and what their ""work personalities"" are like too. ""I don't think we ever know our 'work version' of our partners. Mine used the phrase 'sense check' the other day, I was like 'who even are you?!',"" says Alison Hinchliffe from Mottram in Greater Manchester. Her husband Scott works for an American company, and she says she notices a lot of cross-cultural phrases on his Zoom calls. He's also seen a different side to her. ""I work in arrears recovery for a social landlord, and obviously have a lot of worried and distressed people on the phone,"" says Alison. She says she's ""not a very sentimental person"", so when Scott hears her on the phone, ""he laughs and says he never realised how much compassion I have"". Spouse ultimatums Working from home won't always bring out the best in our partner though, says Sue Firth. If you find yourself living with the ""sergeant major"" version of your husband or wife it can cause friction. For example, she says several of the executives she coaches are struggling to cope without the fix of adrenaline they usually get from being in the office environment. ""Some are getting frustrated and are difficult to live with because what matters to them is winning, competition, control,"" she says. Some of their spouses have had to issue ultimatums - you work in your study, and when you come out you don't bring your phone. Other executives she's spoken to are tense and can't relax, which isn't easy for partners and kids either. Sheri Jacobson, founder of psychotherapy clinic Harley Therapy in London, says such revelations don't have to undermine a relationship if dealt with well. ""It's perfectly possible a person is a tyrant at work and a gentle soul at home, and you see both parts when you're working from home together,"" she says. ""But with the general rules of communication and empathy it can be worked through."" Yet even if you only discover very positive traits in your partner, there is the risk of jealousy arising, if you see them getting on a little too well with a colleague for example. ""Your partner will be pretty attuned to notice if there's any romantic spark or flirtation going,"" Sheri warns. But on a work level too, she says seeing your partner in super-efficient, super-connected mode can feel ""a bit threatening to some people"". ""It's possible to feel outdone by your partner because they have better abilities than you were aware of."" Opposites attract? Fortunately, that couldn't be further from the case for Mattia Zambaldi and Frankie de Tavora, who have been working alongside each other in their London flat. They've found plenty of things they don't have in common. He works for stadium management at Arsenal FC, she doesn't like football. He gets up punctually at 6:30am, she rolls up, interrupting his meetings, at 9:30. She's ""goofy by nature"" and, working in hospitality as an events and sales manager, is used to an unstructured week. He wears a body brace to ensure a healthy posture and insists on set meal times. But they're both gushing with admiration for the other's abilities. ""She's very sharp,"" says Mattia. ""She understands straight away topics that are not straight forward. When it comes down to being professional, sometimes I wonder why she's not at the top of a big company."" ""I'm super-impressed,"" says Frankie. ""His dedication is clear to me."" She says Mattia is able to be both professional and genuinely himself at the same time, and has a vast array of skills. She feels lucky that her future children will have a father with such knowledge. And if the hours working side-by-side have taught them one thing, it's that they want to spend more time together, not less. So instead of going back to work, Frankie is considering returning to university. That way she can have weekends and evenings free. But for some, there are downsides to spending so much time with your partner in a work environment. ""I've discovered a severe dislike of his music,"" says Alison Hinchliffe. ""Phil Collins is awful. I knew I didn't like him before but I can't stand him now!""",What is it you do again? Before the coronavirus lockdown a lot of us didn't really know what our partner did at work. Our eyes have been opened.
"By Natalie DonovanReporter, BBC Radio 4 With UK coronavirus infections rising at present, potential restrictions on meeting up are unclear. But thousands more turkey chicks, known as ""poults"", are being reared for Christmas meals. And some producers are betting on travel restrictions keeping more people at home over the festive period. One south Wales farm, which normally rears 70,000 turkeys a year, told Radio 4's Farming Today it has already cut its numbers by 20%. Nick Davis from Usk Vale Poultry is concerned the birds will be too big for the numbers at the dinner table. The turkeys were ordered in the spring when the outlook for a ""normal"" Christmas seemed clearer. He said: ""In May, when we canvassed our main core of customers, who are retail butchers, they were having a boom time. ""[They] were saying nothing is going to change, because everything's buoyant, and we want the same numbers as last year. But that was easy for them to say."" ""We have to decide what size people want and you can't even tell me today what size that might be."" He said the farm has ""a bit of flexibility"". ""We can play around with rations a bit, and we can process [slaughter them] a week or 10 days earlier, so we can reduce the size to a certain extent, but not by massive percentages"". Socialising restrictions New rules from Monday mean people will be banned from meeting more than six people socially indoors or outdoors. It is not yet clear how long the new ""rule of six"" will be in place, although Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Radio 4's Today programme he hoped it would be lifted before Christmas. Similar rules are being introduced in Scotland and Wales. According to data from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the number of turkey chicks being reared in the first six months of 2020 increased compared to the same period last year. Between January and June 2020, there were 6.2 million poults on farms, compared to 6.1 million in the same period in 2019. Despite worries by some farmers about an over-supply of turkey, some producers are more optimistic, believing more families will be at home this Christmas should travel restrictions remain in place. Neil Cooksey, commercial director for Bernard Matthews, said that could be good news for turkey producers, with in-home consumption of the meat expected to increase. ""The eating out-of-home occasion and holiday market is going to be much smaller, and our view is they will convert into retail sales. People want turkey on their plates at Christmas and that's never going to change. ""Do I see purchases and orders going up this year? Yes I do,"" he said. However smaller producers remain nervous about demand for the larger birds they are rearing. Mr Davis said ""The run up to Christmas is not a fun time for a turkey farmer at the best of times, but this year we really are on tenterhooks. ""It's going to be a lucky turkey producer that gets this Christmas right, rather than a clever one"".",Some turkey farmers are concerned there may be an over-supply of birds this Christmas with social gatherings potentially much smaller than usual.
"Law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer is to carry out a review, and independent accountants will also be appointed to investigate. Shares in Ted Baker fell to a 10-year low as analysts described the news as ""less than ideal"" and a ""blunder"". This year, former boss Ray Kelvin stepped down over misconduct claims, while sales and profits have tumbled. In the latest setback, Ted Baker said it may have accounted for up to £25m of stock, mainly clothing, on its balance sheet that did not exist. The company said in a statement: ""Ted Baker is committed to ensuring the independent review is completed in an efficient and transparent manner and will update the market as appropriate. Whilst the review is ongoing, the company will not comment further."" Ted Baker added, however, that it did not expect any cash impact from the overstatement of inventory. The problems are the latest setback in a difficult year for the firm. In March, Mr Kelvin - who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1988 - resigned over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"". He has denied all allegations of misconduct. The company has also seen its sales, profits and share price tumble. In October, the retailer reported a £23m loss for the six months to 10 August, down from a £24.5m profit last year. For years Ted Baker bucked the trend with growing sales and profits, a business which knew its customers and pitched its products at the right price. But it's had a turbulent 2019. Ray Kelvin turned the business from a single store in Glasgow into a global brand. He was one of the UK's most successful retailers. In many ways Ray Kelvin was Ted Baker. His departure was bound to have some impact on the brand, especially when it came to innovation and quirkiness. But some wonder whether its troubles point to far deeper issues within the business. For instance, has Ted Baker become too expensive in a very competitive market where rivals are discounting like mad. This blunder is the last thing it needs. News of the inventory problems come just weeks after the company appointed Rachel Osborne as its new finance head. The issue was also mentioned in Ted Baker's last annual report based on information from its auditors, KPMG. The accounting giant said it had uncovered mis-statements but concluded they were too small to affect the fashion label's accounts. 'A bit worrying' Retail analysts at Liberum said: ""Today's latest news from Ted Baker, regarding the overstatement of last year's inventory value, is less than ideal."" AJ Bell's investment director Russ Mould said it appeared that ""Ted Baker has found another banana to slip up on"". ""Discovering that the value of inventory on its balance sheet has been overstated is a huge blunder on its behalf,"" he said. ""It suggests that the business hasn't got a grip on its numbers which is a bit worrying considering that new chief executive Lindsay Page used to be the finance director. ""Appointing a law firm and the intention to bring in independent accountants will raise questions about whether more serious problems are bubbling under the surface at the business."" The company is due to publish its latest trading next week.",Fashion retailer Ted Baker has said it may have overstated the value of its stock by between £20m and £25m.
"Alex Brazier, the Bank's executive director for financial stability, said a ""sharp return"" to ""dense office environments"" should not be expected. Social distancing guidelines in the workplace and public transport capacity were two factors holding people back. ""We should expect a more phased return,"" he told a committee of MPs. ""I feel safe coming to work, but I quite understand why many people might not,"" he said in evidence to the Treasury Committee. ""It's not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and dense places like that, with the intensity that we used to use it. ""It's not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly."" Mr Brazier's remarks come after the government launched an ad campaign encouraging people to go back to the workplace. Business leaders have warned of economic damage being done to city centres as people stay away from offices. Last week, head of the CBI Dame Carolyn Fairbairn said the prime minister needed to do more to get workers to return, warning of a ""high price for local businesses, jobs and communities"". However, an increasing number of employers say that home working - which was initially brought in as a temporary measure during lockdown - could become a more permanent state of affairs. The law firm Linklaters, Lloyds Banking Group, NatWest, Fujitsu, Capita and Facebook are among those who plan to allow much more flexible working in the future. Meanwhile, 50 of the biggest UK employers questioned by the BBC said they had no plans to return all staff to the office full-time in the near future. One of the main reasons given for the lack of a substantial return was that firms could not see a way of accommodating large numbers of staff while social distancing regulations were still in place. Government campaign This week, the government launched a campaign asking employers to reassure staff it is safe to return by highlighting measures taken to prevent the spread of Covid-19. But there was confusion when Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he cared more about how employees performed than where they were working, contradicting other ministers. On Wednesday, during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons, Boris Johnson made several references to the need to get people back to work, saying he and his colleagues were working to get the country and the economy ""back on its feet"". The PM's spokesman recently said: ""The message from the PM is he recognises the importance that returning to work has in stimulating the economy, and that's why we have changed the guidance to give employers more discretion in how employees can work safely.""",A senior Bank of England official has cast doubt on the government's drive to get workers back to the office as coronavirus curbs are eased.
"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter ""The bounce back in prices reflects the unexpectedly rapid recovery in housing market activity since the easing of lockdown restrictions,"" it said. Activity has been boosted by pent-up demand and the stamp duty holiday. But the lender warned: ""There is a risk this proves to be something of a false dawn."" The average price in July was £220,936, according to the Nationwide. However, while prices were up 1.5% from a year earlier, July's price was 1.6% lower than in April at the beginning of lockdown. However, it was a marked change to June's prices when the market posted its first annual fall in eight years. The rebound in prices reflected a number of factors, said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. He said pent up demand was coming through, from people who had already decided to move before lockdown began. But some people were moving because of their lockdown experience, he said. ""Behavioural shifts may be boosting activity, as people reassess their housing needs and preferences as a result of life in lockdown,"" he said. ""Moreover, social distancing does not appear to be having as much of a chilling effect as we might have feared, at least at this stage."" He said the upward trends look set to continue in the near term, and will be further boosted by the recently-announced stamp duty holiday. But he added a note of caution. ""Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken significantly in the quarters ahead as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as government support schemes wind down. ""If this comes to pass, it would likely dampen housing activity once again in the quarters ahead."" Lenders cautious Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, also warned that the future may not be so positive for the housing market. ""Lenders remain keen to lend but also cautious as to borrowers' financial positions, given the impending end of the furlough scheme and a number of redundancies which have already been announced,"" he said. Anna Clare Harper, author of Strategic Property Investing, warned: ""What no one can forecast is what happens next, with some nerves among homeowners, investors and economists as to what the future may hold."" Jonathan Hopper, chief executive of Garrington Property Finders, said lockdown would have a lasting effect on the property market. ""Like so much else that has been transformed by the pandemic, the property market map is being redrawn as people reassess what they want from their homes and when, or even if, they need to travel to work,"" he said. ""Three months of being cooped up in the same four walls has led many people to consider a move.""","House prices bounced back in July, climbing 1.7% during the month compared to a 1.5% fall in June, according to the Nationwide."
"The US tech giant sold 74.8 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter, compared with 74.5 million a year ago. Apple said revenue for the next quarter would be between $50bn (£34bn; €46bn) and $53bn, below the $58bn it reported for the same period a year ago. This would mark Apple's first fall in revenues since it launched the iPhone. Despite first-quarter iPhone sales being below the 75 million expected by analysts, it was still a record quarter for the company. Apple revenue in the three months to 26 December was $75.9bn and net profit was $18.4bn, both of which are the highest ever recorded by the company. Sales of iPhones accounted for 68% of the company's revenue in the period. Analysis By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Any other company announcing record profits and revenues might expect a warm welcome from investors. But now that Apple has scaled so many peaks the worry is that the only way is down - and there's evidence in these figures to back up those concerns. Sales of the iPhone, surely the single most profitable product any company has produced, were basically flat. What's more, the revenue outlook for the next three months indicates we can expect the first fall in sales since the iPhone's 2007 launch. Then there's China - still growing but far more slowly. The iPhone is still an object of desire there, but at a time when Apple says it's seeing softness in the economy, the attractions of cheaper rivals from local firms like Xiaomi may grow. Of course, the worries about ""peak iPhone"" have surfaced before and evaporated with the hugely successful iPhone 6. Last year's upgrade to the 6S was a minor one, and we can expect something more radical in September. But the pressure is now mounting on Apple to deliver another blockbuster product to keep the profit engine running. The Apple watch will not fill that role - we've still not even heard any sales figures for the product. Perhaps the 1,000 engineers rumoured to be working on an Apple Car will come up with the exciting innovation which Apple's fans and investors await with growing impatience. Is the mighty iPhone in decline? Chinese 'softness not seen before' Apple boss Tim Cook credited ""all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV"" for the performance. But the firm's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company was operating in ""a very difficult macroeconomic environment"". He added that ""iPhone units will decline in the quarter"" and that the company was not projecting beyond those three months. Mr Maestri partly blamed the strong US dollar for Apple's flat sales, estimating it had knocked $5bn off the company's revenues. Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - rose 14%, but that was much slower than the 70% increase a year ago. Mr Maestri said the softness in China was ""something that we have not seen before"", Reuters reported. 'Mother of all balance sheets' China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined. The profitability of Apple's business improved, with gross margin - or how much the company makes per product - increasing to 40.1%. Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple was ""generating industry defying margins"" and had cash of almost $216bn. Speaking to analysts, Mr Cook said the company had ""the mother of all balance sheets"" and that its financial position had never been stronger. Apple's shares were down 2.7% in after hours trading at $97.28. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Capital Markets who owns shares in Apple, said given the ""white knuckles fears"" ahead of the results, he would ""characterise the overall headline performance as better than feared"".",Apple has reported the slowest growth in iPhone sales since the product's 2007 launch and warned sales will fall for the first time later this year.
"The price of crude oil has fallen by 25% since the summer. Total also said its new chief executive, Patrick Pouyanne, will tour the Middle East, Europe and the US to meet key oil contacts and shareholders. Mr Pouyanne was elevated to the role following the sudden death of executive chairman, Christophe de Margerie, in a plane crash in Russia last week. Lower demand Brent crude is currently trading at $86.32 a barrel, near a four-year low, and is forecast by analysts at Goldman Sachs to fall to as low as $80 a barrel next year. The fall in the oil price has been blamed on an abundance of supply and lower demand, partly prompted by lower manufacturing and industrial production in China - the world's second largest consumer of the commodity. Oil companies have seen billions wiped off their stock market values in recent weeks. Total chief finance officer Patrick de La Chevardiere said the impact of lower oil prices should start to be felt more strongly in the fourth quarter. A $10 a barrel drop in the price of Brent crude translates into a $1.5bn drop in net profit over a year, he added. Last week, Mr de Margerie died along with three aircraft crew members after his private jet hit a snow plough on the runway at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport. Mr Pouyanne said he was committed to continuing with Mr de Margerie's plan to reduce spending and costs in order to return more cash to shareholders. ""The recent decrease in the price of Brent highlights the importance of the programmes we launched to reduce costs and control investments to strengthen the resilience of the group,"" he added. Total shares were 1.6% higher at €46.22 in mid-morning trade in Paris. Mr Pouyanne will go on a mini-tour to meet shareholders in Europe and the United States before the end of the year. Another priority is to build contacts with key oil-producing countries. Russia, which the French oil firm forecast in April would become its biggest source of oil and gas output by 2020, is expected to be high on the list of countries to visit. Total is one of the top foreign investors in the Russian oil industry, but has faced a cloud over its future since the country's relations with the West soured over Ukraine leading to sanctions.",French oil firm Total has reported a 2% fall in third quarter net profit to $3.5bn (£2.2bn) on falling oil prices.

The Bankia-BFA group as a whole made losses after tax of 21.2bn euros in 2012.

"Social media users have expressed concern that the search engine might be the latest foreign website to be blocked by censors. Chinese authorities operate a firewall that blocks many US tech platforms, including Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft hasn't said if the outage may be due to censorship, or is merely a technical problem. ""We've confirmed that Bing is currently inaccessible in China and are engaged to determine next steps,"" Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. A BBC correspondent in China attempted to visit the site, and was able to access it through a Chinese internet provider on a desktop, but not on a smartphone. Many US tech companies are keen to tap into the Chinese market, but have a difficult relationship with the authorities in Beijing. The government's internet censorship regime, often known as the ""Great Firewall"", uses a series of technical measures to block foreign platforms and controversial content. Chinese authorities have also cracked down on Virtual Private Networks, which allow users to skirt around the firewall. China-based messaging services and social media are restricted, with key words and expressions blocked if they express dissent or ridicule senior political leaders. China ambitions Bing's rival Google shut down its search engine in China in 2010, after rows with the authorities over censorship and hacking. Google has said that it has no immediate plans to re-launch a search engine in China, but has admitted it has looked closely at the idea. Although Twitter is blocked, it maintains a Greater China office because Chinese customers can use the platform to advertise abroad.

"The 76.1% employment rate is the highest since records began in 1971. Unemployment fell by 35,000 to 1.34 million in the period, putting the rate below 4% for the first time since 1975. The figure is 112,000 lower than a year ago, giving a jobless rate of 3.9%, well below the EU average of 6.5%. Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, were estimated to have increased by 3.4%, before adjusting for inflation, down by 0.1% on the previous month but still outpacing inflation. ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said: ""The employment rate has reached a new record high, while the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for a job - the so-called 'economic inactivity rate'- is at a new record low."" Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Today's employment figures are further evidence of the strong economy the chancellor detailed in last week's Spring Statement, showing how our pro-business policies are delivering record employment."" Where are the new jobs being added? The number of men in employment increased by 77,000 to a record high of 17.32 million. The number of employed women rose by 144,000 to a record high of 15.40 million - the largest increase since February-to-April 2014. The UK's highest regional employment rate was in the south-west of England (79.9%), while the largest estimated increase in workforce jobs was in the south-east of England (59,000). In December, London (91.5%) had the highest estimated proportion of people working in the services sector, while the East Midlands had the biggest proportion of production jobs (14.5%). The ONS figures also reveal a record number of 1.67 million people working for the NHS in December - 32,000 more than a year earlier. What has happened to unemployment? The unemployment rates for both men and women aged 16 years and above have been generally falling since late 2013. Men's unemployment then stood at 7.4% and women's at 6.9%. The new total unemployment rate of 3.9% has not been lower since the November 1974 to January 2015 period. The 4% figure for men is at its lowest since April to June 1975, while the 3.8% for women is the lowest since comparable records began in 1971. Meanwhile, the number of economically inactive people fell by 117,000 to 8.55 million, a rate of 20.7%, the lowest on record. The number of job vacancies in the economy increased by 4,000 to 854,000. Why are jobs, but not investment, flourishing? By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent If you were being uncharitable to politicians, you might say today's jobs figures demonstrate how little they matter. ""Crisis, what crisis?"" said recruiters as they hired 220,000 people in the three months to the end of January. How can you reconcile all that job creation with talk of a Brexit-induced slowdown? One answer is that the jobs market lags behind the rest of the economy. Recruiting people takes time; it can be months between noticing you need some new staff and their starting work, so the recruitment decisions reflect recruiters' sentiments months ago. Another reason may be that our jobs market is highly flexible, which is to say the risks fall on employees. In uncertain times, a company whose order book is expanding may prefer to take on people who can be ""let go"" later if things go wrong. That can be less costly than investing large sums in new plant and machinery, for example - investment which might prove wasted if demand for your goods shudders to a halt in a few months' time. If that story is right, it helps explain why the economy is generating jobs, but not much investment. And although there are more of us working, notably women and older people joining the workforce, the amount we each produce is barely growing. That puts a question mark over the sustainability of real wage growth of 1.4% - the strongest in more than two years. Are companies ignoring Brexit uncertainty and continuing to hire? It appears that Brexit is not stopping firms hiring staff - at least, not yet. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Businesses have been steadfast in bringing on board new staff and in creating vacancies, despite question marks over the future path of the economy. ""But with uncertainty around Brexit reaching a crescendo, firms are becoming more and more cagey over their hiring decisions."" Andrew Wishart, UK economist with Capital Economics, said: ""There was no sign in the labour market data of Brexit concerns at the start of the year, as the data beat expectations in every regard."" Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said that Britain was closing in on Nordic employment rates and added: ""While business investment has stagnated, firms are choosing instead to invest heavily in new staff."" Wages are still ahead of inflation, despite a lower increase than last month. What does this all mean for interest rates? Analysts think that the outcome of Brexit could lead to an interest rates rise later this year. Mr Wishart said: ""If there is a long delay to Brexit or a deal is struck, we suspect the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee will raise interest rates this summer."" And Mr Parikh added: ""Employers will want to avoid a disorderly withdrawal from the EU and will above all be urging policymakers to return some much-needed oxygen to the skills and productivity agenda.""","The number of employed people in the UK has risen again, to a new record number of 32.7 million people between November and January, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show."
"By Szu Ping ChanBusiness reporter, BBC News The IMF described the global decline as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. It said the pandemic had plunged the world into a ""crisis like no other"". The Fund added that a prolonged outbreak would test the ability of governments and central banks to control the crisis. Gita Gopinath, the IMF's chief economist, said the crisis could knock $9 trillion (£7.2 trillion) off global GDP over the next two years. 'Great Lockdown' While the Fund's latest World Economic Outlook praised the ""swift and sizeable"" response in countries like the UK, Germany, Japan and the US, it said no country would escape the downturn. It expects global growth to rebound to 5.8% next year if the pandemic fades in the second half of 2020. Ms Gopinath said today's ""Great Lockdown"" presented a ""grim reality"" for policymakers, who faced ""severe uncertainty about the duration and intensity of the shock"". ""A partial recovery is projected for 2021,"" said Ms Gopinath. ""But the level of GDP will remain below the pre-virus trend, with considerable uncertainty about the strength of the rebound. ""Much worse growth outcomes are possible and maybe even likely."" Sharpest UK downturn in a century The IMF predicts the UK economy will shrink by 6.5% in 2020, compared with the IMF's January forecast for 1.4% GDP growth. A decline of this magnitude would be bigger than the 4.2% drop in output seen in the wake of the financial crisis. It would also represent the biggest annual fall since 1921, according to reconstructed Bank of England data dating back to the 18th century. However, this is half the annual rate expected by the OBR, which expects GDP to drop by 35% in the three months to June. The UK's furlough scheme, which is designed to keep workers in a job amid the government lockdown, is expected to limit the rise in unemployment to 4.8% in 2020, from 3.8% last year. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged billions of pounds in wage subsidies and loan guarantees to help workers and businesses through the shutdown. The Bank of England has also slashed interest rates to a new low and freed up billions of pounds for commercial banks to lend. Global pain Ms Gopinath said that for the first time since the Great Depression, both advanced and developing economies were expected to fall into recession. The IMF warned that growth in advanced economies would not get back to its pre-virus peak until at least 2022. The US economy is expected to contract by 5.9% this year, representing the biggest annual decline since 1946. Unemployment in the US is also expected to jump to 10.4% this year. A partial recovery is expected in 2021, with expected US growth of 4.7%. The Chinese economy is expected to expand by just 1.2% this year, which would be the slowest growth since 1976. Australia is expected to suffer its first recession since 1991. The IMF warned that there were ""severe risks of a worse outcome"". It said that if the pandemic took longer to control and there was a second wave in 2021, this would knock an additional 8 percentage points off global GDP. The Fund said this scenario could trigger a downward spiral in heavily-indebted economies. It said investors might be unwilling to lend to some of these nations, which would push up borrowing costs. The IMF added: ""This increase in sovereign borrowing costs or simply fear of it materialising, could prevent many countries from providing the income support assumed here."" Economic medicine While longer lockdowns will constrain economic activity, the IMF said quarantines and social distancing measures were vital. It said: ""Upfront containment measures are essential to slow the spread of the virus and allow health care systems to cope and to help pave the way for an earlier and more robust resumption of economic activity. ""Uncertainty and reduced demand for services could be even worse in a scenario of greater spread without social distancing"" The IMF set out four priorities for dealing with the pandemic. It called for more money for health care systems, financial support for workers and businesses, continued central bank support and a clear exit plan for the recovery. It urged the world to work together to find and distribute treatments and a vaccine. The Fund added that many developing nations would need debt relief in the coming months and years.","The global economy will contract by 3% this year as countries around the world shrink at the fastest pace in decades, the International Monetary Fund says."
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter After last year's test which focused on a collapse in house prices in the UK, this year's test will have a more international flavour. Under the scenario, global growth will fall, the Chinese economy slow markedly and the UK and the eurozone will face a new bout of recession with rising unemployment and falling property prices. In Britain, the economy will contract by 2.3%. As the Bank grapples with the new crisis, interest rates in the UK are cut to zero. And as the global economy slumps, the oil price collapses to $38 and deflation - causing companies to withdraw investment - ""increases the real burden of debt and increases market concerns"". The world would see the worst levels of deflation since the 1930s. Some major global banks and companies could default on debt repayments. To be clear, the Bank's five-year scenario does not mean it believes these events will happen. This is what is called a ""tail-risk"" event. It could happen but the probability is exceedingly low. But then again, no-one predicted the severity of the financial crisis. And actually this scenario is not as bad as what actually happened in 2008, even though it is put in place to try to stop those calamitous events ever occurring again. Six banks Six banks will have their balance sheets tested against this stress test - HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Santander UK and Standard Chartered. The building society Nationwide will also be tested. Many believe that this will be a tougher test for banks with large international businesses - HSBC and Standard Chartered - than the UK domestic test of last year. Co-op Bank, a mainly UK bank, has been dropped from this year's test. ""Last year's stress test demonstrated how much stronger the core of the UK financial system has become since the financial crisis,"" said Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England. ""This year's test will have a different focus. ""By assessing the resilience of the UK banking system against a major external shock, we will improve further our ability to identify vulnerabilities and we will ensure that banks have plans in place to address a wider range of possible stresses. ""We are committed to ensuring our major banks are resilient [and] that they can weather shocks without calling on tax payer support."" 'Severe' tests Under the scenario, banks will be obliged to continue lending to the UK economy, one of the biggest risks of a global turndown. The results of the tests, which bank officials believe are ""severe"", will be published in December. Banks might then be required to raise more capital to strengthened their balance sheets. One big missing piece of the stress test is a break up of the eurozone. That might seem odd, given events in Greece. But Bank officials explain that the eurozone is a more immediate issue and that the direct exposure of the UK banks to Greece is low at about £2bn. Put simply, British banks should already have in place the mechanisms to deal with a eurozone break-up.","The Bank of England has outlined its annual ""stress test"" - the exam Britain's major banks must go through to ensure they have enough available capital to withstand a global downturn."
"By Katie HopeBBC News, Davos Speaking at Davos, he said some firms were ""quite understandably... waiting for the fog of Brexit to clear"". But Mr Hammond said for many foreign firms the UK had become a ""buying opportunity"", partly due to the fall in the pound since the referendum. The chancellor added that the UK economy had been resilient in 2016, ""confounding many sceptics"". He was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on how the UK would handle Brexit. Some companies are delaying investment decisions, and waiting ""to have a better understanding what the future looks like"", he said. ""But other businesses that are not so dependent on access to European market, on trade barriers have continued to invest,"" he said. Pointing to investments by Google, Apple and Japan's Softbank, he said: ""The UK is now seen as a buying opportunity because of the depreciation of the currency and the fact that fundamentally we are still a large market with 65 million affluent consumers."" 'Reinvent ourselves' In wide-ranging comments on Friday, the chancellor also said: The UK was fully prepared to reinvent itself after Brexit, Mr Hammond said at the annual economic event. ""If we were to be, by some catastrophe, closed off from those [European] markets we would have to reinvent ourselves. ""And I just want to send out a clear message that we've reinvented ourselves before... we will do so again if we have to,"" he said. 'Long transition' Also at Davos, German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the UK and Europe had to manage Brexit ""to minimise or to avoid any damage to the UK as well as for Europe"". ""The UK remains a very important partner,"" Mr Schaeuble said. But he added the ""detail"" would be much complicated than ""the opening speeches"". Mr Hammond said the UK's exit was not just about negotiating a free trade deal, and could involve talks on migration policy and interim arrangements. ""There will be many transitions involved… these will take many years."" The government has said it will trigger Article 50 - the formal process of leaving the EU - by the end of March. After that, it will officially have two years to complete the process. Mr Hammond said the government was still on track to meet this ""rigid timeframe"", adding that by the end of March 2019 he expected to ""at least"" have agreement on the ""broad principles of the end state that will exist"". Trump presidency However, he said establishing ""significant new infrastructure"" to deal with potential issues such as Britain's borders and customs ""cannot be built and deployed in a few months"", which is why a transition deal would be so important. ""All of these things we have at the moment and all of these things we'd like to work closely with the EU on - these will take many years,"" he said. Turning to trade with the US, Mr Hammond said Britain's relationship with the Trump administration would ""prosper"", but he warned against short-term thinking. ""We have to listen to what the voters are telling us, and be mindful of the messages we are getting from them,"" he told the BBC. ""But we must also be clear and honest with the electorate, that some of the solutions which appear to offer short term relief, may not be in own their long term interests.""",Chancellor Philip Hammond has acknowledged that Brexit uncertainty may cause firms to delay investment.
"By Simon CoxBBC Radio 4's The Report Staff said the vast majority would not be pursued because the cases involved were over two years old and open to legal challenge from taxpayers. There is a backlog of 7.5 million cases of tax underpayment or overpayment - the latter estimated at £3bn which will be reimbursed - dating back to 2007-8. An HMRC spokesman said no decision had been made on underpayment cases. The details come just weeks after it emerged a further six million people had been wrongly taxed in the past two years, with 1.4 million people who underpaid set to receive an unexpected tax bill. The latest cases to emerge, which are part of a huge backlog of open cases dating back to 2007/8, are not on the HMRC's new computer system and will have to be dealt with manually. 'Frustrating' Front-line staff at HMRC have told The Report on Radio 4 that only those cases that verge on fraud will be pursued. Cases where money is owed to taxpayers by the Exchequer will still be processed. One staff member told the BBC: ""For each underpayment there are thousands of pounds owed. Underpayments are very frustrating. ""If we had the chance to sort it out three years ago we could have recovered the money. It is now likely to be written off if it's over two years - we're not looking at underpayments beyond two years."" The staff member added: ""Our directors are telling people that [those who owe tax] will appeal and fight it and this will generate more work."" Another staff member who has worked on open cases said that in their experience the underpayment of tax was never pursued. ""These people who have underpaid earn 30, 40, 50k a year and got benefits such as a company car and we're not told about them until after the tax has been paid."" The staff member added: ""The cases cannot be dealt with by the new computer as they have to be done manually - what did we do with the cases older than two years? We wrote them off."" The delay in handling these open cases is due to a combination of a historic backlog, which once reached 30 million, the additional work created by problems with the new computer system and a shrinking number of staff. HMRC has cut 20,000 jobs since 2006 and aims to shed a further 5,000 by next year. An HMRC spokesman said: ""We have said to staff if you find an overpayment to pay it back - we are prioritising vulnerable groups, old age pensioners, low-income groups - the priority is to repay these groups. 'Future decision' ""But while we are reviewing the cases of underpayment, no decision has been made on on these cases."" He added: ""It's a provisional period, where staff have been asked to review underpayments. If they find someone who has underpaid then that is set aside for a future decision. ""We are going to be looking at how best to deal with these. We are going to look at the specifics of each case and apply a normal criteria in due course. ""Those who have underpaid, they will be part of the overall decision-making process - no decision yet on what to do with them. But they are being identified.""","Up to £1.5bn of unpaid tax is likely to be written off by HM Revenue and Customs, insiders have told the BBC."
"Money Talk by Paul EvansAxa UK & Ireland group chief executive Are motor insurance companies profiteering at a time when every household is feeling the pinch? No: in fact motor insurance has not been profitable for insurers for many years as the cost of claims continues to rise. So, if claim costs are rising, then UK drivers must be having more accidents? Actually no. Department for Transport statistics show the number of accidents fell by 10% over the past three years. Yet, in the same period, the numbers claiming for an injury suffered in a car accident has increased by 43%. Frivolous and fraudulent Sadly, some accidents do lead to serious injury. However, the substantial increase in claims relate to smaller injuries, mainly whiplash, now running at about 1,200 new claims every day. It is these that account for more than half of the recent increase in premiums. It is strange that whilst the NHS spends about £8m a year treating genuine whiplash, insurers pay out around £2bn in compensation. The UK seems gripped by an American-style compensation culture, fuelled by those who seek to make a quick buck. Insurers are in business to pay all valid claims fairly and promptly, but increasingly incur frivolous or fraudulent claims, the costs for which are flowing into higher premiums. How has this happened? Two primary factors lie at the root of this situation. Firstly whiplash claims are ripe for opportunists, or to put it bluntly, fraudsters. Secondly, the ""no win, no fee"" legal environment, a system that permits recovery of high legal costs from insurers rather than the claimant, provides too great an incentive to try it on. Changes in the law in 1999 restricted legal aid for personal injury claims in motor accidents. The rules that followed - the no win, no fee arrangements - created an environment where claimants no longer had any interest in the level of costs run up by their lawyers In 2010, the Ministry of Justice introduced a new process for dealing with motor injury claims of £10,000 or less and set a fixed fee for legal costs incurred at each stage of the process. For a typical whiplash compensation claim of £2,500, the lawyer would earn a fixed fee of £1,350. This, with other associated costs, brings the insurance company's bill to about £4,400. The profits personal injury lawyers can generate from simple personal injury claims are so large that they want as many claimants as they can find. Referral fees From the fixed fees, lawyers can afford to pay fees to those who refer claimants to them. This proved the catalyst for a rapid growth in claims management companies, the better of which provide a valuable service for those who have suffered loss. However too many simply saw the opportunity for making money out of a broken system. Referral fees are paid to many different participants in the events that follow a car accident. When two or more vehicles are involved, even the insurance company of the not-at-fault driver will refer their customers details for a fee - a practice Axa has banned. The insurer knows that the insurer of the at-fault driver will pick up the tab. This new industry of finding potential claimants has led in turn to daytime advertising and a barrage of unwanted texts and cold calls. You will be told you are entitled to compensation even though you may never have been injured in an accident. Simply put, a claims management company will contact someone with a potential claim and then ""sell"" that person to a personal injury lawyer. The money that changes hands is known as a referral fee - the average income today being about £800 per referral. Access to justice The personal injury and claims management lobby argue that banning referral fees will prevent people bringing genuine claims but we disagree. Insurers are in the business of paying claims and do so on a daily basis. In 2010 £27m per day was paid out on motor claims alone across our industry. Less scrupulous individuals have also seen an opportunity for making money out of minor injuries. If you are in a car that is hit by another vehicle - a rear end shunt is a common example - you may suffer some neck injury, or whiplash. But, as there is no medical process in which a doctor can either diagnose or disprove whiplash, this area is ripe for possible fraud. Fraud is a growing problem for our industry. In 2010, 133,000 fraudulent insurance claims were detected, totalling £919m, an increase of 9% on the previous year. What next? This whole situation is dysfunctional at best, but given its impact on motor premiums, it is also immoral and unsustainable. Reform is necessary and will not disadvantage those who suffer real injury. Axa would like to see referral fees banned immediately. But as they are directly related to the amounts of money lawyers are paid, we additionally call for a significant reduction in the fixed fees paid through the Ministry of Justice process. If the average referral fee is £800, then a similar reduction in lawyer's fees would seem justifiable. If fees are not reduced, a ban on referral fees will be completely ineffective and motor premiums will continue to rise. It is clear to us that if these measures are introduced, motor premiums will reduce. In Ireland, similar problems were addressed a few years ago by introducing a new scheme that takes lawyers out of the equation. Motor premiums fell by 16% in the first two years of the scheme's operation. Finally, we need to seriously consider how we contain the growth in whiplash claims. A number of countries have taken action. In Germany for example, there can be no claim for whiplash where the shunt takes place under 10km/h (6.2mph). We must of course make sure that all genuine injuries are compensated. So we advocate that government and insurers work with medical bodies to agree formal criteria for the diagnosis of whiplash. It should be for the claimant to prove that they have suffered whiplash rather than for insurers to disprove it. Only through these measures can we ensure that motor insurance premiums are no longer a pain in the neck.

"By Yogita LimayeMumbai correspondent, BBC News Two weeks ago, two sewer cleaners in Mumbai lost their lives while doing their job. Unions claim they are among dozens of sewer workers who die in India every year because they are not given any safety equipment. ""When I lift my hand to my mouth to take a bite of food, I feel like it smells of sewage,"" says Binod Lahot, a sewer worker in Mumbai. ""But I still eat it. Why? Because I have to stay alive and go back to work tomorrow."" Mr Lahot doesn't know his age, but says he has been doing the job for more than 20 years. Most days you'll find him in a hole in the ground, scooping out sludge with his bare hands, unblocking the city's sewer lines. It's a critical job, but workers like Mr Lahot get paid less than $5 (£3.50) a day. He's often surrounded by swarms of cockroaches, and has no mask to protect him from the poisonous fumes that the sewage emits, but that's not the hardest bit of the job, according to Mr Lahot. Some days he has to go much deeper underground with only a rope to help him, and he's scared that he could drown if he gets caught in a sudden rush of sewage. It's happened before. Death rate Ismail Kazi, a 45-year-old worker drowned while cleaning sewers in 2014. In his one room home in a Mumbai shantytown, his wife Rehana Kazi says he chose to do this difficult and dangerous job so that he could educate his three children. Mrs Kazi breaks down as she tells me her eldest son has had to drop out of college to support their family. According to a survey done by the sewer cleaners union in Mumbai, Mr Kazi was among 28 workers who have died in the city since May 2014. Mumbai's municipal corporation does not have data specifically for sewer workers, but last year it said 1,386 conservancy workers had died over six years since 2009. In addition to sewer cleaners, conservancy workers include all those who sweep the city's streets and ferry garbage to dumping areas. The civic authority has commissioned a study to assess the reasons behind the number of deaths, but officers from the municipal administration declined to answer specific questions from the BBC on why no safety gear or insurance is offered to sewer cleaners. One reason could be the way they're hired. While the city's civic authority directly employs around 30,000 people to keep Mumbai clean, the more difficult and dangerous job of unblocking sewer lines is usually done by casual workers who are hired on a day-by-day basis through contractors, and so they're not eligible for medical or life insurance benefits. B Samuel Banda is one of the contractors who hire sewer cleaners. I asked him why they don't provide safety gear. ""We do give them gloves and rubber boots sometimes,"" he says. ""But it's a very unorganised sector. ""We work with different people every day and at the end of the day we go our separate ways. So getting insurance policies made for workers is difficult."" This isn't a problem unique to Mumbai. No national surveys have been conducted, but social workers estimate that around 100 sewer workers die every year across India. In 2014, India's supreme court had ruled that the families of those who died while working in sewers since 1993 should be given around $15,000 (£10,000) as compensation. But many like Rehana Kazi are yet to see any money. ""We have got no help from the government. No one has even come to meet us,"" she says. Last year the Indian government started collecting a separate tax from citizens to fund a major cleanliness campaign. Workers like Binod Lahot are integral to that plan. And while theirs will always be a difficult job, it does not need to be such a risky one.",On Sunday two workers suffocated to death while cleaning drainpipes in the southern city of Bangalore.
"Industrial output fell in November as demand for exports continued to slow. Consumer prices also dipped, indicating that deflation continues to remain a hurdle in boosting domestic demand. Japan has been seeking to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in exports, which have fallen for six months in a row, and sustain growth. 'Fully ingrained' Japan has been battling with deflation or falling consumer prices for many years. It has hurt attempts by Japanese policymakers to boost domestic consumption as consumers and businesses tend to put off purchases in the hope of getting a cheaper deal later on. According to the latest data, the core consumer prices index, which excludes fresh food, fell 0.1% in November, from a year earlier. ""This is a clear indication that deflation is really ingrained in Japanese economy and it is inevitable that the central bank will have to do something to tackle it,"" Martin Schulz of Fujitsu Research Institute told the BBC. Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, is already under pressure from new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to take steps aimed at tackling deflation. Mr Abe has called upon the bank to raise its inflation target to 2% - double its current target. During his election campaign Mr Abe had also suggested that the central bank should print ""unlimited"" yen to help stoke an increase in consumer prices. Analysts said the latest dip in consumer prices may see further pressure being put on the central bank and that the bank may introduce some measures soon.. ""It is highly likely that it will react in January,"" said Mr Schulz. ""The Bank of Japan may be more aggressive in its monetary easing and is also likely to raise its inflation target, which will be a clear indication that it will continue to act in the near future."" Factory output turnaround? Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry said that industrial production fell 1.7% from the previous month. Compared with the same month a year earlier, it was down 5.8%. Industrial output has been hurt by a dip in demand for Japanese exports from key markets such as eurozone and China. The ongoing debt crisis in eurozone has hurt shipments to the region, while sales to China have been hurt by a territorial dispute between the two countries. The strength of the Japanese currency over the past few months has only made matters more difficult for Japanese exporters their goods became more expensive for foreign buyers. However, the yen has seen a significant drop in recent weeks, falling more than 10% against the US dollar since October. Analysts said that the weak currency was likely to help revive growth in the export sector, which in turn will help boost factory output. ""Industrial production will be helped by the weaker yen as many leading manufacturers rely heavily on overseas sales,"" said Mr Schulz of Fujitsu Research Institute. ""There might be turn around as early as next month,"" he added.","Japan has reported weak economic data, underlining the challenges the new government faces in reviving growth in the world's third-largest economy."
"By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC News Despite warnings from Kenya's central bank about the volatility of crypto-currencies, some businesses in Nairobi are now accepting Bitcoin payments. The total number of Bitcoin transactions in Kenya are estimated to be worth over $1.5m, according to the Blockchain Association of Kenya. But can the technology really take off? Crypto-currencies are virtual money that can be used to pay for things in the real world, such as a hotel room, food or even a house. Digital tokens are held in online wallets, and can be sent anonymously between users. Crypto-currencies run on a technology called blockchain - a ledger of blocks of information, such as transactions or agreements, that are stored across a network of computers. The information is stored chronologically and is designed to be de-centralised and tamper-proof. While this provides security, it also means there is no oversight from a central authority such as a bank or a government. The first-ever blockchain-backed currency developed was Bitcoin, and it continues to be the most widely-used globally. At the moment, the crypto-currencies Bitcoin, Dash and Lisk are used in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe. Blockchain is also being implemented by start-ups and tech conglomerates alike in Kenya to help solve problems, such as IBM's platform to help small businesses to prove their creditworthiness for loans. Preventing theft Tony Mwongera, the chief executive of Healthland Spa in Nairobi, began accepting Bitcoin payments in 2018. ''I decided to adopt the use of crypto-currencies because there was so much theft in my business,"" he told the BBC. ""So I said, let me use a way that can be safe, secure and I can also embrace technology."" Healthland Spa customers told the BBC that they like the convenience of using crypto-currencies to pay for purchases. However, if you look at the total number of people in Kenya using virtual currencies today, it is still relatively small - only about 40,000 people have ever made a transaction using Bitcoin. Part of the reason crypto-currency penetration isn't growing that much is because Kenya's central bank has forbidden banks from dealing in virtual currencies. Banks are not allowed to open accounts for people who are known to dealing in any virtual currency, which means that the population cannot easily convert Bitcoin payments into cash or mobile money. ""Crypto-currencies can facilitate and ensure that you do an unlimited number of transactions, however the volatility, lack of control and the non-acceptability of crypto-currencies across different jurisdictions impairs what you'd expect a currency to do,"" economist and policy expert Vincent Kimosop told the BBC. The Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK) disagrees with this way of thinking, and it is actively working to educate the country on the benefits of using crypto-currencies and blockchain. The non-profit body says that using virtual currencies can greatly reduce the cost of transactions, and enable people without bank accounts to quickly make and receive payments. According to BAK, there are many things Kenyans have realised they can use Bitcoin for - whether it is to pay merchants in China for goods, or to enable Nigerians to pay to send their children to school in Kenya, or to enable young African freelancers to be easily paid for their work online.","Interest in virtual currencies is rising across the African continent, especially in Kenya, Africa's Silicon Valley."
"By Russell HottenBBC News How about a British Airways drinks trolley? A First Class cabin bread basket or slippers, perhaps? Or even a hot towel (available cold)? On Monday, the cash-strapped airline began selling off thousands of items of surplus stock, from champagne flutes to bedding. Other items include an insulated box from a Boeing 747 kitchen, yours for £75, and serving trays - £10 for five. The move comes months after BA decided to auction some of its precious artwork hanging in offices and airport lounges, including a £1m-plus work by Bridget Riley. BA's profits have evaporated and the airline is making thousands of job cuts because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on air travel. Last month, BA's parent company IAG reported a £5.1bn loss for the first nine months of 2020, a dramatic reverse from the £1.6bn profit made during the same period in 2019. But the latest sale is not just because it needs to save every penny, the airline says. Changes in the mix of aircraft fleet and in-cabin service, plus the likelihood that BA will be a slimmer operation until air travel picks up, mean its warehouses are full of items that will never be used. BA retired its 747 aircraft this year, and has put some memorabilia in the sale. And while the event is not quite a sell-off of the family silver, the airline is getting rid of stacks of English bone china made by William Edwards, including plates, soup bowls, cups, saucers, and butter dishes. A set of four William Edwards pasta bowls is £40. Carolina Martinoli, British Airways' director of brand and customer experience, said it was the first time the airline had organised such a sale. ""We know that these special items will fly and we are delighted to be able to offer them in time for Christmas to give people the opportunity to make it memorable during a difficult year,"" she said. 'Unusual items' Rob Burgess, of the frequent flyer website www.headforpoints.com, said that from the reaction among the community using his site ""it appears there's a huge appetite to buy"". ""I think it is partly nostalgia, and partly because it is actually excellent value for money given the suppliers that BA uses. Some items such as the day blankets have already sold out along with the brandy and champagne glasses."" The metal boxes used in the aircraft kitchens seem to be going fast, he added, probably simply because it's a chance for people to ""get their hands on some unusual items"". Aircraft items and memorabilia can be hugely popular among enthusiasts. For example, Concorde products are among the most sought-after. At the top-end of collectibles, the famous dropped nose cones fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds on the rare occasions they come up for auction.",Can't think what to buy your loved one for Christmas?
"Thames says the increase is needed to help pay for a ""super sewer"" being built across London. On Monday, water companies in England and Wales submitted price proposals for the period to the regulator, Ofwat, with all but Thames saying they would hold or cut prices in real terms. The proposals exclude inflation, which companies could add on an annual basis. Thames says its bills would fall in real terms in the period were it not for a £2.8bn investment in the Thames Tideway Tunnel sewer network. ""Much of London's water and sewerage infrastructure dates from Victorian times,"" said Thames Water chief executive Martin Baggs. ""It has served us well, and allowed Thames Water's customers - both in London and in the Thames Valley - to benefit from some of the lowest bills in the country for decades. ""However, this infrastructure urgently needs upgrading which inevitably puts upward pressure on bills,"" he said. Last month, the water regulator blocked a plan by Thames to raise prices by an inflation-beating 8% for next year. Several water companies have proposed keeping any increases in household bills under the rate of inflation during the five-year period, including Severn Trent, United Utilities, and Anglian. ""We hope our pledge to peg back bills for the next six years, and to protect them from higher inflation, will offer help and give reassurance to our customers,"" said Peter Simpson, Anglian chief executive. Dwr Cymru Welsh Water has also promised below-inflation price increases. Glas Cymru chairman Bob Ayling said: ""By 2020 we will have seen 10 consecutive years of keeping our price increases below inflation - reducing our prices by 12.5% in real terms."" The regulator will make a final decision on the proposals from each water company by the end of 2014. Cathryn Ross, Ofwat's chief executive, said: ""Ofwat's job is to make sure that customers get a fair deal from water companies.

"The GMB and Ucatt unions and a law firm representing claimants have also accepted an apology. The case emerged in 2009 following a raid on the Consulting Association in Droitwich by the Information Commissioner's office. It uncovered a list of more than 3,000 names and reference cards. They detailed workers' political views, competence, trade union membership and industrial relations activities. The defendants in the case are Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Keir, Lang O'Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska and Vinci. In a submission to the High Court last year, the firms accepted that construction companies had provided much of the information and had used it to vet workers seeking employment. The companies accepted that the vetting information system ""infringed workers' rights to confidentiality, privacy, reputation and latterly data protection"". The companies offered an ""unreserved apology"" for their part in operating the system, for any adverse employment consequences and for the distress and anxiety caused to workers and their families. Despite the admissions, the firms continued to defend cases where they claimed there was no link between the vetting system and the loss of employment and where the losses being claimed were unsubstantiated. The case had been due to be heard at the High Court next month. In a statement the firms said: ""In October 2015, these construction companies, unlike any other companies involved in the vetting system, openly acknowledged that the system was unlawful in various respects and made a full public apology, which was widely reported at the time. ""The construction companies have offered financial settlements which all claimants represented by Ucatt, GMB and [law firm] GCR have now accepted as fair and reasonable. The parties have also agreed a joint statement to be read in court as part of this settlement. These construction companies now wish to draw a line under this matter."" There is outstanding litigation between the construction companies and the Unite union, with a trial due to start on 9 May.",Eight construction firms have offered financial settlements to workers who said they were blacklisted within the industry.
"The increase will be based on the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for July of 2.8%. The figure is likely to lead to an increase of more than £100 in the annual cost of getting to work for many commuters. Passenger groups urged a change in the way ticket prices are calculated, as RPI is no longer a national statistic. The cost of most train fares are set by train companies themselves, but about 40% of fares in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated so that they are only allowed to rise by an amount pegged to the RPI rate of inflation in July the previous year. These regulated fares include annual season tickets. The government's preferred measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), increased to 2.1%. The Campaign for Better Transport (CBT) has repeatedly said that CPI, the most widely watched and used measure of inflation, should be used instead of RPI. Last month this was 2% and it is typically lower than the RPI rate of inflation. CBT chief executive Darren Shirley said the expected ticket price rises were ""exorbitant"". ""The government should commit now to January's fares rise being linked to CPI,"" he added. The difference between the two is stark. For every £100 paid on a season ticket, using RPI over CPI has increased prices by about £6 since RPI was abandoned by the National Audit Office as a national statistic in 2013. ""The only benefactors of using the retail price index (RPI) to calculate the cost of rail fares are the train companies,"" said Kevin Brown, savings specialist at Scottish Friendly, an investment firm. ""Passengers are therefore having to fork out more money to travel despite regularly having to deal with over-crowded and unpredictable services. The general outlook for consumers is already difficult and this will feel like another kick in the teeth for many hard-working families who are facing the prospect of a second recession in 10 years. A monthly season ticket from Widnes to Liverpool, currently costing £129.80 will cost £133.43, an increase of £3.63. A monthly pass from Reading to London will go from £442.00 to £454.38, up £12.38. A season ticket from Bath Spa to Bristol Temple Meads today costs £162.10 a month. From January it will be £166.64, up £4.54. Rail Minister Chris Heaton-Harris said: ""It's tempting to suggest fares should never rise. However, the truth is that if we stop investing in our railway, then we will never see it improved."" The TUC, a federation of unions, renewed its call for the railway to be renationalised, arguing it would lead to lower ticket prices. ""We're already paying the highest ticket prices in Europe to travel on overcrowded and understaffed trains. ""The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising private train companies,"" said TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. Rachael, a commuter in Watford, Hertfordshire, told the BBC: ""I've seen the rail fares increasing again this year, and for me it's just becoming impossible to justify, and I'm worried I'll be priced out of working in London within a few years if this keeps happening. ""The cost of my train ticket, and the dreadful service is causing me such grief, and I'm only travelling from Watford junction to Euston. It costs me £3,680 on an annual ticket. ""Something needs to change. Please."" The bitter irony for rail passengers is that the quality of service in Britain is all too often undeserving of the price. After a cataclysmic year on parts of the network last year, punctuality was generally on the up this year before the hot, and then wet and windy, weather caused significant disruption this summer. The promise (via an ongoing Government-commissioned rail review) is that our train companies of the future will only make money if they run trains on time. In principle that sounds good for passengers but we still don't know how it will work in practice and when such a system will actually arrive at a station near you. The wider financial dilemma for Government is that our rail network is in large parts ageing and in need of a refit. Infrastructure upgrade work costing the taxpayer billions is ongoing or planned. Government sources point out that a relatively small proportion of public transport journeys are made by train (roughly 17%). Therefore, they argue, a rise in ticket prices, however painful for passengers, is a necessary evil to meet the rising costs linked to running the railways. More train delays At the start of this year, train fares went up by an average of 3.1% in England and Wales and 2.8% in Scotland. The rise in England and Wales - the highest since January 2013 - meant the price of some annual season tickets rose by more than £100. In Scotland, peak-time season tickets and anytime day tickets became 3.2% more expensive, while the capped increase of off-peak fares was 2.2%. Rail passengers have had to endure more delays on the network this year. Last week was particularly bad, with thousands of people affected by a signal failure, which led to the suspension of all services out of London Euston, on Thursday. And then trains were also affected in Friday's power cut, with many stranded across the network Delays also happened during July's heatwave, while in January, London Overground commuters were given a month's free travel after delays to the delivery of new electric trains.",Rail users in the UK will be hit by a further rise in ticket prices which will come into effect next year.
"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, New York In shareholders' first chance to react to Tuesday night's results, the stock plunged more than 14.5% to $31.24, the lowest level in a year for the microblogging site. The drop came despite Twitter reporting better-than-expected revenues and earnings for the second quarter. Analysts said the firm's honesty over its problems had made investors wary. ""There's not going to be a a material reversal in trends anytime soon. They were extremely candid about that. That's why the stock is down,"" MCH analyst James Cakmak told the BBC. Despite the negative investor reaction, Mr Cakmak said the firm's openness was ""evidence of a focus"" that was not there previously, which he said provided ""comfort"" over its future direction. But in general, Wall Street analysts reacted negatively, with an estimated 18 brokerages cutting their estimates of the shares' valuation to as low as $30. 'Radical shift' That is significantly below the $38.80 price at which the shares debuted on the US stock market in 2013. Investors' main concern remains user growth, with active users rising to 316 million in the three months to June, just a slight increase on the 308 million in the first quarter. While chief financial officer Anthony Noto acknowledged the problem - saying people were still not clear why they should use Twitter, and that it was still too difficult for people to use - analysts are still not convinced the firm will be able to fix its problems. ""In essence, it must go from being a one-product company to an ecosystem and this will require a radical shift in strategy from where the company is today,"" said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor. And RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said improvements in revenues would not be enough to help it grow in the long term. ""That's why monthly average user growth matters. That's why user and usage metrics matter,"" he said. The other fear for investors is that the firm has still failed to appoint a permanent new chief executive after previous boss Dick Costolo stepped down. Co-founder Jack Dorsey started as interim chief executive at the start of this month, but Mr Cakmak warned it made the firm's long-term direction uncertain. ""What's the new chief executive's game plan? We don't know,"" he said.",Twitter's openness about the difficulty it is having attracting new users has failed to pay off with investors.

"Economic output, GDP, fell by 0.6% in the three months to June, worse than analysts had predicted, and revised figures for the first quarter of the year also showed a fall of 0.2%. A recession is usually defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The news will be damaging for the government of President Dilma Rousseff. According to the most recent poll, Ms Rousseff would lose to a rival candidate, environmentalist Marina Silva, if October's election went to a second round. The World Cup, held in June and July, was not regarded as generally good for business, says the BBC's Wyre Davies in Rio de Janeiro. ""There were more days off for employees and many traditional tourists stayed away,"" he says. ""The problem is that, with elections due in early October, the economy is increasingly seen as President Dilma Rousseff's weak point."" The data showed that civil construction, manufacturing and investment especially suffered during the second quarter. 'Worrying slowdown' ""This recession shows the exhaustion of a growth model that has been centred on internal consumption,"" said Eduardo Velho, chief economist at investment firm INVX Global in Sao Paulo. ""It is a good picture of what the economy is suffering - a slowdown in industry, a fall in investment, rising inventories. The recovery from here will be slight,"" he continued, saying that deep reforms would be needed whoever wins the next election. The second quarter figures prompted analysts to revise down expectations for full-year figures. ""With the sharp fall in investment, the potential GDP growth rate shows a significant and worrying slowdown in recent quarters,"" said Cristiano Oliveira, economist at Banco Fibra in Sao Paulo. ""That said, we now expect no growth in the Brazilian economy in 2014, despite moderate growth in the global economy."" Analysis: Katy Watson, business reporter, Sao Paulo A decade ago, Brazil was the darling of emerging economies. The country reaped the benefits of soaring commodity prices and government spending helped millions of poor Brazilians enter the middle class - the future looked bright. But it's a very different picture now. Investor and consumer confidence has fallen, just like industrial output and retail sales are struggling too. The World Cup may have taken people's minds off economic worries temporarily, but the issue is now top of the agenda. There is just over a month to go before the presidential elections and today's figures will be seen as an opportunity for candidates hoping to unseat President Dilma Rousseff. They'll use the R-word to try to convince voters that their economic policies are a better alternative for the country's future.","Brazil has fallen into recession, just a month before the general election, latest figures show."
"British company De La Rue - which had lost the £490m contract to French-Dutch Gemalto in March - had requested the longer ""standstill period"", which has now been agreed by the Home Office. It means a final decision will now be made on Tuesday 17 April. De La Rue is also taking initial steps ""towards initiating appeal proceedings against the provisional decision"". However, it has refused to clarify what this means legally or how any appeal process might proceed. The firm says the time extension will give it more time for close scrutiny of the criteria that the Home Office used in coming to its decision to award the contract to Gemalto. It says it will assess that information and whether it might help it in its arguments. De La Rue's bid was not the cheapest, but it said it was ""the highest quality and technically most secure"". ""We have a preferred bidder, which demonstrated it was best able to meet the needs of the passport service, delivering a high quality and secure product and providing best value for money for the taxpayer… that remains the government's position,"" said the prime minister's official spokesman. But the extension ""will give all bidders the chance to find out more detail and get more information from the Home Office… this is standard process."" The spokesman added: ""This has been a rigorous, fair and open process."" The current EU-themed burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. However, people are expected to keep their current passports until they expire. Before the bidding process extension, a spokesperson for De La Rue had said: ""We can accept that we weren't the cheapest, even if our tender represented a significant discount on the current price. ""It has also been suggested that the winning bid was well below our cost price, which causes us to question how sustainable it is."" The decision to give a foreign company the contract had been criticised by pro-Brexit government figures. Under EU procurement rules, the Home Office was required to open up the bidding process to European firms, although De La Rue has manufactured UK passports since 2009.

"They were the last shoes to sell in an auction of 100 pairs of trainers - from Adidas to Air Jordans - in New York. The 1972 Nike Waffle Racing Flat Moon Shoe was expected to fetch $160,000. But Canadian collector, Miles Nadal paid almost three-times that, having already forked out $850,000 for the other 99 pairs in the auction. The Nike Waffle Moon Shoes were designed by Bill Bowerman, a track coach who co-founded Nike. Just 12 pairs were hand-made, with a number being handed out to runners at the 1972 Olympic trials, and the pair being auctioned is thought to be the only one not to be worn. Noah Wunsch, Sotheby's global head of e-commerce, said Mr Bowerman used a waffle iron to imprint the tread on the shoes. The new owner of the shoes, Mr Nadal - who founded an investment firm, Peerage Capital - said he was thrilled at his purchase, calling the Moon Shoe a ""true historical artefact in sports history and pop culture"". ""I think sneaker culture and collecting is on the verge of a breakout moment,"" he added, saying he plans to display them, along with the other 99 pairs he bought last week, at his private automobile museum in Toronto. Back to the Future Mr Nadal's haul included two pairs of Nike Mags, shoes made famous in the 1989 Back to the Future Part II because they had automatic lacing - a technology the company didn't bring to the market until almost three decades later. The limited edition Back to the Future 2016 sneakers were thought to have fetched between $50,000 and $70,000. Another star of the auction was the Jeter edition Air Jordan 11, created to commemorate New York Yankee baseball star Derek Jeter's retirement in 2017. Only five pairs were made. They were estimated to have sold for close to $60,000. The highest price fetched at a public auction for trainers is thought to be $190,373 for a pair of signed Converse shoes worn by Michael Jordan in the 1984 Olympic basketball final.

"Businesses in the energy sector have been seized by President Evo Morales's left-wing administration. It follows a trend started by Venezuela's president Hugo Chavez, who has called on all Latin American nations to follow his lead. Bolivia's government has said it is redistributing oil and gas wealth to the country's indigenous population. In May 2010, four electricity firms, which between them account for more than half of Bolivia's electricity market, were expropriated. ""We're just fulfilling the promise we made when we were elected, to recover all these areas that were in the hands of the state before these privatisations"", Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera told the BBC World Service. Armed police Bolivia's vice president is currently visiting the UK, and is trying to persuade British companies to invest there. But he has had to answer questions about the expropriation of these electricity firms, one of which was British. ""Foreign investment can come to different areas. All we're expecting is that they comply with the rules of the country,"" said Mr Linera. Rurelec, which is based in London, owned just over half of Guaracachi, a power-generating company in Bolivia. On 1 May 2010, Guaracachi's office was taken over by government forces and handed over to ENDE, the state power company. Rurelec says armed officers, clad in balaclavas and armed with automatic weapons, smashed their way into their Santa Cruz office. ""Military police came in, they kicked down the doors and they took control of all of our facilities. They removed my finance director at gunpoint"", said Peter Earl, Rurelec's chief executive. Compensation Rurelec is seeking compensation from the Morales government, but so far nothing has been paid. In May, the company said at least $70m (£46m) would be a ""fair"" figure. This week Mr Earl told the BBC: ""It depends how the Bolivians choose to play it. If they force us to go to arbitration, we will be claiming in excess of $150m."" Britain's BP and France's GDF Suez have also had assets seized in Bolivia. The government said it was compensating fairly the former owners of businesses that have been nationalised. Despite what has happened, firms, such as Rurelec, still seem keen to invest in Bolivia.

"The bank has 48,000 UK workers and will make cuts in both its retail and investment banking operations. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the jobs would go by ""natural attrition"". Staff turnover stood at about 3,000 annually. A total of 25,000 jobs could be axed globally, meaning close to 10% of HSBC's 266,000 workers will go. The bank will also rebrand its UK High Street branches but is yet to decide on a new name. Options could include reviving the Midland Bank brand, which it bought in 1992, or adopting the name of its UK online bank, First Direct. 'Treated fairly' Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said he wanted to ensure that customers made a distinction between HSBC's investment and retail banking operations. The bank is being forced by new government rules to formally separate the two businesses. Dominic Hook, national officer with the union Unite, called on HSBC to achieve any job cuts through voluntary means and natural attrition. ""It's really sad that all our members, all the hard work they've done to try to get the bank back working properly after all the scandals of the last few years, are going to be paying with their jobs,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The number of UK branches is expected to fall by about 100 from 1,057 now. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, business editor Tomorrow is the date of the Mansion House speech - George Osborne's annual summary of financial regulation and the City. The Chancellor could send a positive message to banks, saying that they are welcome in the UK and that regulation and the tax burden need to be ""proportionate"". That could pave the way to a reform of the bank levy so that it has less of an impact on the foreign operations of UK banks. That could be announced in the Budget on 8 July. The Chancellor could also decide not to raise the levy. Both would be welcomed by large global banks such as HSBC. BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed said the UK job cuts would come as a shock to staff: ""Global banking now is a far tougher business than it was pre-the financial crisis. It is hard to get profits."" Mr Gulliver was ""running a bank that investors believe simply doesn't make enough money"", he added. Our correspondent said the bank was now looking to ""reduce its footprint in developed economies"". HSBC plans to sell assets in Turkey and Brazil, where it will continue to service large corporate clients. 'World has changed' The news came ahead of a presentation that Mr Gulliver gave to investors and analysts in his second major strategy plan since taking up the role in 2011. ""We recognise that the world has changed and we need to change with it. That is why we are outlining the following... strategic actions that will further transform our organisation,"" he said in a statement. The 10-point plan aims to cut costs by up to $5bn (£3.25bn) and increase investment in Asia - particularly in China. ""Asia [is] expected to show high growth and become the centre of global trade over the next decade,"" Mr Gulliver said. ""Our actions will allow us to capture expected future growth opportunities."" Shares in HSBC were down 0.9% at 614p in afternoon trading in London, and closed down 0.5% in Hong Kong. The company is valued at almost £120bn. Headquarters decision James Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia, said the plan would not restore investor confidence in HSBC. ""Slaughtering the staff is not necessarily the solution unless management makes the bank considerably less complex,"" he said. HSBC said it would make a decision on whether to move its headquarters out of the UK by the end of the year. There has been speculation that the British bank may relocate its headquarters to Hong Kong since it announced the review in April. Analysis: Robert Plummer, business reporter HSBC used to style itself as ""the world's local bank"", combining the heft of a global brand with the sophistication of local knowledge. Yet it started moving away from that business model as far back as 2011, hit by a combination of spiralling costs and setbacks in some of those local markets to which it was a latecomer. In fact, however much we hear about economic globalisation, global banks are having a tough time of it these days. Not only are they hard to manage, but they also face stiff competition from local banks in individual countries. In Brazil, for instance, where HSBC was unknown until 1997, it has been outflanked by local operators Itau and Bradesco. Unsurprisingly, then, it has decided to dispose of its subsidiary there and concentrate on the area where its expertise has always been clear: East Asia in general, and China in particular. Mr Gulliver laid out a number of criteria for the decision - including whether the UK government supported the growth of financial services industry. He insisted that any move would not be a response to any UK legislation affecting banks, but about deciding ""where the mind of the company should be"". The government bank levy cost HSBC more than £700m last year - more than any other bank. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to signal a review of the levy in his Mansion House speech on Wednesday night.","HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, is planning to cut 8,000 jobs in the UK as it tries to reduce costs."
"The European Union and the IMF bailed out the Republic of Ireland in 2010 and Portugal in 2011. The 17-member group that uses the euro currency agreed to the terms at a meeting of finance ministers in Dublin. Meanwhile, the ministers also said a 10bn euro ($13bn; £8.5bn) EU bailout loan for Cyprus was ready for approval by member states. That could happen by the end of the month and, if the IMF also gives the go-ahead, the first bailout money could be released by mid-May. Key extension The plan for Ireland and Portugal is intended to give the countries' financial systems more time to recover from the debt crisis after their bailout loans run out. Ireland's bailout money will run out later this year, and Portugal's will run out in 2014. The Irish and Portuguese repayment extensions are expected to be backed by all 27 European Union members, which includes those outside the eurozone, later on Friday. Eurogroup President and Dutch Finance Minister, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, said the ministers in Dublin had commended Portugal on its success in implementing the bailout programme but ""asked them to maintain the reform momentum despite the difficult economic and domestic conditions"". He added: ""Ireland is a living example that adjustment programmes do work, provided there is a strong ownership and genuine commitment to reforms."" The BBC's Matthew Price said that the deal could be seen as something of a reward ""for good behaviour"", but also as recognition that an austerity-first approach was not always the best option. The extension is especially important for Portugal. When it received a 78bn euro bailout two years ago, it pledged to take various measures in its budget to reduce public spending. However, last week the country's Constitutional Court ruled that several of these measures in the 2013 budget were unlawful. If Portugal was to drop the measures because of this, it may not remain eligible for more funds under its bailout. Cyprus crisis On Thursday, it emerged that Cyprus would need to raise an extra 6bn euros to secure the 10bn euro bailout from Brussels and the IMF. While confirming that up to 10bn euros in loans will be provided to Cyprus, the eurozone finance ministers also rejected reports that the country might be granted more financial assistance. Presidential spokesman Christos Stylianides said the country was not looking for more money under the bailout programme, but was hoping for support through other European support mechanisms: ""What the president of the republic [of Cyprus] is discussing with European officials is the possibility of increasing European funds for growth and social cohesion."" Cyprus will ask for the money under the EU's multi-annual financial framework designed for member states suffering serious consequences from the euro crisis. A draft document prepared by the country's creditors said the cost of the rescue had risen to 23bn euros from 17.5bn euros, with Cyprus now having to find 13bn euros of this. Mr Anastasiades said he had spoken to EU Economy and Euro Commissioner Olli Rehn and said he would also be writing to European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso and to EU President Herman Van Rompuy. ""The letter to Mr Barroso and Mr Rompuy will refer to the need for EU policy to change towards Cyprus by giving it extra assistance, given the critical times we are going through as a result of the economic crisis and the measures imposed on us,"" Mr Anastasiades said. Meanwhile, the German government said that the size of the eurozone bailout for Cyprus would not rise. ""The contribution from international creditors will not change,"" said German government spokesman Steffen Seibert, noting that 10bn euro package was ""already very large"". It is expected that Cyprus will sell much of its gold reserves to help fund its side of the bailout. Also, bank depositors with more than 100,000 euros in savings will bear part of the cost of the rescue. The bank sector on which much of the Cypriot economy was dependent is shrinking, and thousands of jobs are being lost. Laiki Bank is being wound up and its healthy assets transferred to the Bank of Cyprus. Slovenia plan Eurozone officials meeting in Dublin also reviewed Slovenia's growing problems. There will be no discussion at the meeting of finance ministers, and the country will not make an application for bailout funds. But the country's prime minister, Alenka Bratusek said on Friday that her government will have a plan that should stave off the need for a bailout ready to put to the country's parliament within two weeks. The plan is expected to include the selling off of state assets, probably including a bank. Slovenia, which adopted the euro single currency in 2007, has been forced to recapitalise its main banks and the economy is struggling.",Portugal and Ireland are to be granted an extra seven years to pay back their emergency bailout loans.
"The recall of Prius and Auris cars includes 1.25 million in Japan, 830,000 in North America and 290,000 in Europe, of which about 55,000 are in the UK. All those affected were produced between October 2008 and November 2014. Toyota said it was not aware of any actual accidents caused by the fault. However, the carmaker said that in ""rare situations"", the fault could cause vehicles to stall when entering ""failsafe"" driving mode. ""While power steering and braking would remain operational, a vehicle stall while driving at higher speeds could increase the risk of a crash,"" the company said. Toyota said the cars affected had already been recalled previously for other reasons in 2014 and 2015.

Aldi is the UK's sixth largest supermarket chain, according to analysts at Kantar Worldpanel, with a market share of 5.6% in the 12 weeks to 13 September. Rapid growth For its online service, Aldi said it would offer customers home delivery and collection from third party locations. However, Matthew Barnes, chief executive of Aldi UK & Ireland, said the retailer would not necessarily start selling food online. ""I wouldn't say it's inevitable. Wine by the case and non-food is the most viable place for us to start,"" he told reporters. ""We wouldn't do anything to endanger our model or threaten our cost base."" Aldi and rival discount chain Lidl have been expanding rapidly in the UK in recent years, and Mr Barnes said he was ""very confident"" there would be an Aldi store in every UK town in the future. The rise of the discounters has put enormous pressure on the ""big four"" UK supermarket chains - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - who have been forced to cut prices in order to defend their market share. Mr Barnes said Aldi was ""consistently 42p cheaper per item than the market average"". ""Despite all the efforts [by rivals] to lower prices, they are nowhere near Aldi."" Earlier this month, rival Lidl said it would become the first UK supermarket to implement the minimum wage as recommended by the Living Wage Foundation. From October, Lidl UK employees will earn a minimum of £8.20 an hour across England, Scotland and Wales, and £9.35 an hour in London. Aldi said that 90% of its staff already earned more than the rate recommended by the foundation.","Aldi has said it will start selling goods online in the UK next year, as it announced record annual sales in 2014."
"Mr Ford, 45, has a malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen and will begin chemotherapy within 48 hours. ""I'm optimistic about treatment,"" said Dr Zane Cohen, who is overseeing his care team. Mr Ford withdrew from his re-election campaign last week after being diagnosed with the abdominal tumour. The controversial mayor, who admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in office, maintains a strong support base despite calls for him to resign. He has also been filmed threatening to kill an unspecified person, as well as making lewd comments about oral sex to journalists. 'A difficult tumour' Liposarcoma is a rare cancer of the soft tissue which accounts for only 1% of all cancers, Dr Cohen said at a news conference at Mount Sinai hospital in Toronto. Mr Ford has a 12cm by 12cm sized tumour in his abdomen and another smaller 2cm tumour in his left buttock, which are believed to have grown within the last three years. ""It's a rare tumour, a very difficult tumour,"" said Dr Cohen. But he also said this type of cancer had proved to be more sensitive to chemotherapy than other tumours. Mr Ford will begin a three-day course of chemotherapy at Mount Sinai hospital within the next 48 hours, Dr Cohen said. This will be followed by a break of 18 days, and then another course. Mr Ford will then be scanned to see how his tumour has reacted to the treatment before doctors decide whether to administer more chemotherapy or follow up with radiotherapy or surgery. Mr Ford was admitted to hospital last week after months of abdominal pain. The discovery of a tumour prompted him to withdraw his candidacy from the mayoral election on 27 October. His brother and political confidant Toronto Councillor Doug Ford has replaced him on the ballot. At the same time, Rob Ford's name was added to the ballot papers to run for councillor in his old constituency of Ward 2 in Toronto's Etobicoke North area, signalling his desire to remain a political force in the city. Dr Cohen said on Wednesday that it was ""impossible to predict"" how chemotherapy was going to affect Mr Ford. ""I think he's a pretty strong person,"" he said. The other top contenders in the mayoral race are former NDP MP Olivia Chow and businessman and former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party John Tory. Rob Ford's troubled mayoralty","Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has been diagnosed with a ""fairly aggressive"" rare cancer, doctors treating him have said."
"It said new coronavirus vaccines boded well for long-term growth, but that a recent jump in cases would drag on the recovery. Uncertainty over the future UK-EU trading relationship also clouded the outlook, it added. The central bank held rates 0.1% and left its stimulus programme unchanged. ""The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain,"" the Bank said. ""It depends on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom."" The Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, predicts the UK economy will shrink by 11.3% this year - the biggest decline in 300 years. It expects unemployment to peak at 9.7%. The Bank said the successful trialling of some Covid vaccines and plans to roll them out next year were likely to ""reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook"". However, it said recent global activity had been affected by the increase in Covid cases and re-imposition of tougher than expected restrictions. ""The successful rollout of vaccines should support the gradual removal of restrictions and rebound in activity,"" it said, ""although it is less clear how this prospect will affect the immediate economic behaviour of households and businesses."" 'No deal risk' At 0.3% in November, inflation remains a long way below the central bank's 2% target. However, it said it was ready to accept inflation above 2% if a no-deal Brexit caused sterling to fall sharply, pushing up prices of imports. The Bank also said it planned to keep the pace of its purchases of British government bonds broadly unchanged in early 2021 as it tries to shore up the economy. But it said it was ready to increase them again if the outlook soured. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said this was the ""clearest indication yet that it would ease monetary policy further, in the event of no-deal"".","The future of the UK's economy is ""unusually uncertain"", the Bank of England has said, as it held interest rates at record lows."
"By Padraig BeltonBusiness reporter ""It's a very efficient way for a company to accept payment, since they receive 100% of the value of a transaction,"" he says. ""Very different from dealing with credit cards, which take at least 2% to 3%."" His company, which offers a popular electronic wallet for storing Bitcoins, now has three million users - plus a London headquarters. Britain's first Bitcoin cash machine has been installed in a Shoreditch coffee shop in London, where you can pay for your coffee from your digital wallet. And argue some, with other successful UK start-ups including Coinfloor, a Bitcoin trading platform, and Elliptic, which aims to offer unhackable ways to store them in offline vaults- Bitcoin is becoming increasingly 'Britcoin'. Britain's tech empire normally shrivels beside that of the United States. Last year London's 'Silicon roundabout' district received $1.4bn (£930m) in investments, compared to Silicon Valley's $22bn (£14.6bn). But the financial crisis forced an outflow of talent from banking to start-ups. And more global financial institutions make their home in wet Britain than sunny California. So London became the world's new financial technology centre, employing more people (over 44,000) in the sector than either Silicon Valley or New York. Payment looms large in financial technology, and start-ups working with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ripple, which are the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalisation, are prominent. Collectively, they're luring big bits of investment. When Elliptic raised £1.2m ($1.8m) in seed funding last summer, it was regarded as an important coming of age for cryptocurrencies. Liquidity savings Cryptocurrencies offer an advantage in countries where official currency exchange is tightly controlled, like China. Cryptocurrencies could revolutionise how banks handle payments, too. Large retail banks currently use central clearing - everything goes to one place, and then back out. But with Bitcoin, this exchange happens in different places and instantaneously. At the moment, the small amount of liquidity in any particular cryptocurrency limits broader use of this system. However, this would grow exponentially if several banks began to convert cryptocurrencies to a traditional currency, and back again. This has happened in Germany, where Fidor Bank adopted the Ripple cryptocurrency for payments. Two American banks have done so as well. The Ripple protocol offers advantages over Swift, the 40-year old system which most banks now use to send payment orders. ""Banks don't have to hold liquidity in all far flung corners of the world,"" says Conny Dorrestijn, one of the judges of the 2015 FinTech50, which looks to promote new types of financial services technology. ""At the moment, if you're a bank in Germany and have two clients who do payments with Chile, you have to hold liquidity in a corresponding bank in Chile. ""With the new protocols, you don't."" Risk versus reward Elliptic calls itself a 'Bitcoin custodian', storing the private keys which they compare to digital gold, in an encrypted form and a secure location. Says its co-founder, Dr Tom Robinson, ""If you're storing it in an internet-connected device, there's always the possibility of web-based hacking. So we store it in a bank vault."" He is unsure we ever will be using Bitcoins as we do physical cash on the High Street, but says block chains - the data structures that record Bitcoin transactions - can be used with tokens representing any financial asset, including shares or bonds. If a company represented its shares in this way, then the platform could transfer ownership of the shares in a highly transparent manner. And dividend payments would be more efficient, since you would simply send Bitcoins to whichever wallet holds the token. A Scottish company called MaidSafe issued 'cryptoequity' last year, with a crowd-sale of what it called MaidSafeCoins. Worries by banks about the money laundering risk from cryptocurrencies has stunted use of block chain technology in the UK banking sector till now. But the money laundering risk from cryptocurrencies can be overstated, believes Dr Robinson. ""The risk is there, but there is a publicly available database, and everyone can look at it, and see every block chain transaction that's ever been made."" Regulating cryptocurrencies The absence of regulation also has been a problem. Britain's tax authorities released a guidance brief on Bitcoin a year ago (and decided not to charge VAT on cryptocurrency mining or trading). Last month, the Bank of England publicly explored the idea of issuing a 'digital pound'. But in general, the UK government has adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In America, New York state has been one of the first governments at any level to propose regulations for the virtual currency industry. Initially, its reporting and capital requirements were viewed as quite onerous on smaller cryptocurrency start-ups, but they have been relaxed. Dr Robinson says it could be time for some light-touch regulation in Britain, to lend cryptocurrencies credibility, and give banks confidence in dealing with them. And the Bank of England concluded if it were ever to create a digital pound, research would be necessary to ensure the technology would not constrict the central bank's ability to control its currency and secure the banking system against attack. Miss Dorrestijn cautions that too much investment may have gone into the front end of payment, and neglecting banks' ageing infrastructure, where the bulk of payments are still handled. ""'98% of the world still works with banks as we know them today,"" she says. ""I see a very new interest in investing in new core technology, new protocols, and new formats."" ""I think the world is oversaturated with wallets, and mobile channels, if they only are a shiny face on an old fashioned mechanism."" More than small change Michel Akkermans, founder of Clear2Pay, says retail banks are mostly hindered in payments by batch-based systems. Transactions get processed once a day, instead of in real time. And legacy payments software is ""written in arcane programming languages no one knows any more"". He says after the 2008 banking crisis, banks have focussed again on their core business of enabling transactions rather than esoteric financial instruments and derivatives. But they are at very different stages in modernising their existing payments infrastructure, he says. One new body, the Emerging Payments Association, represents newer entrants in the payments space. It pushes for non-bank payment firms to have more equal access to retail clearing banks, for such things as faster payments and dealing with consumers through the Post Office, says board advisor Richard Wagner, chief executive of Advanced Payment Solutions. Bitcoins may not yet have met their killer app. But how we pay is undergoing more than small change. And Bitcoin, Ripple, and other new alternative forms of payment are steadily gaining currency, bit by bit.","Two years ago, perhaps 4,000 or 5,000 merchants in the world accepted Bitcoin, says Nicolas Cary, co-founder of Blockchain, now there are more than 100,000."
"Tencent, best known for its WeChat mobile app, has been investing in a number of sectors, including gaming, entertainment, cloud computing and online financing. Tesla said the stake was passive, meaning Tencent would not get a say in how the US firm was run. Shares in Tesla rose 2.3% in early trading following the announcement. Tesla's range of electric cars has included the Model S and the Roadster, which was billed as the world's first electric sports car. The company also specialises in battery storage, and, through its SolarCity subsidiary, residential solar panels. The firm has been raising capital ahead of the launch of its mass-market Model 3 sedan, and gained about $1.2bn through a bond and share sale earlier in March. Tencent, one of Asia's largest technology firms, has backed several electric vehicle companies in the past. It was an early investor in NextEV, a Shanghai-based start-up which since has rebranded itself as Nio and has offices in San Jose, California, close to Tesla's base. Tencent is now the fifth-largest shareholder in Tesla behind chief executive Elon Musk and investment companies Fidelity, Baillie Gifford and T Rowe Price. Mr Musk remains the largest shareholder, with a stake of about 21% as of the end of 2016. A win-win deal? Analysis by Simon Atkinson, Asia Business Reporter Tencent is no stranger to putting money into US companies. Recent investments have included Snapchat-owner Snap and US Uber-rival Lyft - both of which have tech at their heart. So its backing of Tesla can be seen as a vote of confidence in Elon Musk and his ambitious plans to produce affordable electric cars, and later fully self-driving vehicles. More importantly, and perhaps why Tesla's shares jumped on this news, Tencent could conceivably help Tesla make better inroads into the Chinese market. Last year Tesla's sales in the world's most populous nation topped $1bn - but that is a fraction of what it was turning over in the US. And if it really is going to make its Model 3 mass market, it needs consumers in places like China to be buying it. Mr Musk has said he sees Tencent as an ""adviser"" as well as an investor, and the Chinese giant should have plenty of insight having already invested in businesses that are focusing on the future of transport. As well as being an early backer of NextEV, it owns a slice of Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-sharing giant that effectively muscled Uber out of the market, as well as a stake in HERE, the German consortium owned by BMW, Audi and Daimler. And recently Tencent Chairman Ma Huateng said he could see his firm getting involved in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology for driverless cars in the future.",Chinese tech giant Tencent has spent $1.78bn (£1.4bn) on buying a 5% stake in electric carmaker Tesla.
"The latest Markit Composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 52.3 from August's 52.5. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Modest growth in Europe's biggest economy, Germany, provided some cheer, but the eurozone was brought down by stagnation elsewhere, particularly in France, where PMI fell to 49.1. Manufacturing across the eurozone fared worse than the service sector, with the PMI reading falling to 50.5, the lowest measure since July of last year. ""The survey paints a picture of ongoing malaise in the eurozone economy,"" said Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist. ""With growth of output and demand slowing, employment once again failed to show any meaningful increase. Such torpor meant prices continued to fall as firms fought for customers, which will inevitably heighten concerns that the region is facing deflation."" He added that the European Central Bank (ECB), which is faced with the task of warding off deflation, would be ""disappointed"" by the PMI numbers. 'Anaemic demand' On Monday, ECB president Mario Draghi said the bank was ready to use ""additional unconventional instruments"" to help boost the flagging eurozone economy, ""should it become necessary to further address risks of a too prolonged period of low inflation"". Earlier this month, the European Central Bank introduced new measures to stimulate the area's flagging economy. As well as launching an asset purchase programme, through which it will buy debt products from banks, the ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.05%. Business growth in France slumped to a three-year low, with both the manufacturing and service sectors suffering. ""Anaemic demand continues to hold back the private sector,"" said Jack Kennedy, a senior economist at Markit, ""with further price cutting insufficient to prevent new orders from falling"". In Germany, service sector growth rebounded to a two-month high, but manufacturing growth recorded its slowest growth for 15 months. Markit economists also raised concerns about the crisis in Ukraine, and related Russian sanctions, which they warned could have further adverse effects on business in Europe. ""The danger is that the ECB's efforts to stimulate the economy will prove ineffective in the face of such headwinds, which are exacerbating already-weak demand,"" said Mr Williamson.","Eurozone business growth cooled in September for a second consecutive month, dropping to its slowest pace since December, a survey suggests."
"It comes as Carillion announces a 5% rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to the end of June to £67.5m compared with £64.2m a year earlier. Carillion said it had held meetings with shareholders since 11 August, when its second offer was rejected. It has offered an extra cash dividend of 8.5p per share to shareholders. It also said a merger would save both companies £1.5bn and reduce the cost base of the combined group by at least £175m a year by the end of 2016. 'Financial benefits' On Monday, Balfour Beatty said it had swung back into profit, making £1m for the six months to the end of June, compared with losses of £4m for the same period a year earlier. Carillion said on Thursday it ""continues to believe in the powerful strategic logic and financial benefits of a merger with Balfour Beatty and is therefore continuing to consider its position"". Ballfour Beatty responded to Carillion by saying the company had still not addressed ""significant risks"" it had outlined in its rejection of Carillion's second takeover offer. It said Carillion's assessment of the cost savings a merger would achieve were ""incorrect"" adding: ""The board of Balfour Beatty has serious reservations as to the achievability of the stated synergy number and believes that it creates unacceptable operational and financial risks."" The construction firms also said Carillion's desire to cancel Balfour's planned sale of its US business Parsons Brinckerhoff was a significant road block to the deal. Balfour Beatty shares were up 1.48% to 240p, while Carillion's were up 2.22% to 327.10p at midday.","UK construction firm Carillion has sweetened its takeover offer for rival Balfour Beatty, arguing there is 'powerful strategic logic' in a merger."
"The firm has filed a notice to appoint administrators, a move that will give it breathing space from its creditors while it works out a rescue plan. The company has 127 stores and about 1,500 employees. The second lockdown in November came at a crucial period for the firm, which makes a high proportion of sales then. Just under half its sales, 40%, come from trade in November and December. Paperchase said: ""The cumulative effects of lockdown one, lockdown two - at the start of the Christmas shopping period - and now the current restrictions have put unbearable strain on retail businesses across the country."" The company went through an insolvency process, known as a Company Voluntary Arrangement or CVA, almost two years ago to cut costs. The chain now has 10 working days to find a solution. Paperchase said its strong online trading had not made it ""immune"" from the impact of shop closures across the country. ""Out of lockdown we've traded well, but as the country faces further restrictions for some months to come, we have to find a sustainable future for Paperchase,"" it added. ""We are working hard to find that solution and this [notice of administration] is a necessary part of this work. This is not the situation we wanted to be in. High Street pressure The chain is the latest of a string of high-profile retailers to hit trouble in the past year. The sector was already battling with the shift to online sales, coupled with rising costs, including rents and higher minimum wages. Coronavirus restrictions which shut non-essential shops piled on the pressure. Others that have run into trouble recently include Debenhams, which last month said it would cease trading putting 12,000 jobs at risk. Arcadia Group, which owns Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, has also gone into administration, putting a further 13,000 jobs at risk. Meanwhile, Edinburgh Woollen Mills' brands Peacocks and Jaeger also fell into administration in November, putting 21,000 jobs at risk. And earlier last year, Oasis and Warehouse fell into administration in mid-April after failing to find buyers, and online fashion group Boohoo said in June it was buying the brands but closing all stores.",Stationery chain Paperchase is on the brink of administration after most of its stores were forced to close over the Christmas period.
"Cairn also said its sale of a 40% stake in its Indian business to Vedanta was ""moving towards completion"". Shares in Cairn have fallen by about a quarter in the past month. The drop reflects falls in the oil sector as a whole and also concerns about Cairn's oil exploration off Greenland. The Edinburgh-based company's shares closed the day 1.45% up at 293.90pence. In early August, Cairn's share price had fallen when it announced that it was abandoning one of its wells off the coast of Greenland after failing to find any oil. Investors have been hoping that Cairn can reproduce its success in finding oil in India. In its statement, Cairn said it was, ""excited about the prospects and opportunities presented by exploration offshore Greenland"". ""The results from the remaining three, or possibly four, wells in the multi-well exploration campaign are expected later this year.""","Cairn Energy has reported pre-tax profits for the first half of 2011 of £733m, compared with £88m in 2010."
"By Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter The proposed offer is worth £10.75 a share in cash, a premium of 36% to the closing price on 8 December. Sky shares ended 26.6% higher at 999.8p in London following the announcement. Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch controls 21st Century Fox, which already owns a 39.1% stake in Sky. Sky said that the independent directors of both companies had ""reached agreement on an offer price"" of £10.75 a share, but added that ""certain material offer terms remain under discussion"". Fox said Sky's directors had indicated that they were willing to recommend the proposed offer. According to Reuters' calculations, Fox would pay £11.25bn for the stake in Sky that it did not already own. Sterling's 16% fall against the US dollar in the wake of the Brexit vote has made UK companies more attractive targets for foreign companies. Fox is required to ""clarify its intentions"" by 6 January, or walk away for at least six months under UK takeover rules. Alex DeGroote, analyst at Peel Hunt, said it was ""not quite a done deal"", but he would be surprised if it did not go ahead. ""Sky has not performed well in the UK stock market this year, and is seen as a Brexit loser. Fox is of course also a dollar bidder, and the collapse in sterling makes Sky a less expensive purchase than pre-Brexit,"" he said. ""There will also be cost synergies, which will reflect economies of scale in technology and content, such as sports and movie rights."" Fox chief executive James Murdoch was named chairman of Sky this year, fuelling speculation that the US media company would make a bid. Almost 30% of Sky shareholders voted against the appointment of James Murdoch as its chairman at the annual meeting in October, with some saying he was too closely linked to Fox. Piers Hillier, chief investment officer of Royal London, which owns a 0.35% stake in Sky, said at the time: ""Should Fox make a bid for Sky, investors need a strong independent chairman to protect the interests of minority shareholders and negotiate the best possible deal."" Rupert Murdoch has sought to take full control of Sky for many years. Competition concerns In June 2010, his company, News Corporation - from which 21st Century Fox was subsequently split off - made a 700p-a-share offer that valued Sky at about £12bn. It was rejected by Sky's directors for undervaluing the company. The bid was ultimately abandoned in mid-2011 in the wake of widespread opposition and the fallout from the phone hacking scandal that prompted the closure of the News of the World newspaper. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat business secretary at the time of the 2010 bid, said the new offer threatened media plurality in the UK. ""The way Theresa May's government deals with this is a test of their independence from the influence of large proprietors."" Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson said it was up to regulators to ensure competition concerns were addressed. ""The bid must also be judged on its likely impact on the UK news market and the provision of robust and independent journalism,"" he said. ""Finally, given the likely concentration of further media power in the hands of a single company, it is right that the 'fit and proper' test should be applied by Ofcom if the deal is approved by Sky shareholders."" News Corp owns newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Wall Street Journal, as well as other assets such as publisher Harper Collins. In July 2014 BSkyB, as it was then known, paid almost £5bn to take over Rupert Murdoch's pay TV companies in Germany and Italy.",US media giant 21st Century Fox has made a takeover approach for Sky that values the UK-based satellite broadcaster at £18.5bn.
"The Queensland government in north-east Australia has complained to Google, which says it will look into the issue. Firms looking to promote their small towns as remote tourist destinations say Google Maps inflates travel times. Outback businesses say errors in the map app can add hours to a journey. 'Confidence' ""People aren't coming to places because they think it takes too long, or they're missing opportunities to refuel and they're getting sent off on another road that has no fuel [outlets],"" Robyn Mackenzie, of the Eromanga Natural History Museum, told national broadcaster ABC. ""People will get frightened of travelling in the outback, because they don't have any confidence in the mapping,"" the general manager of the small town museum added. In one case, the journey time from Birdsville, on the Queensland border, up to the Western Star Hotel in Windorah, in the centre of the state, was estimated to be close to 11 hours by Google Maps. After claims the time was inaccurate, Google changed the estimated time to about 7 hours and 45 minutes. But locals say the drive is closer to four hours with no stops. 'Accurate model' Now the state government has been in touch with Google. ""We are so dependent on these apps now to get us around cities, to get us around towns and to get us around big states like Queensland,"" acting Queensland premier Cameron Dick told the ABC. ""We need to ensure that those apps and the information they are providing are as accurate as possible."" Google, which takes mapping information from a range of sources, including public information and data from users, said it was investigating. ""Google Maps strives to accurately model and reflect the real world,"" the firm said in a statement. ""We are investigating to see what may have happened here and will take the appropriate action. We apologise if any businesses or communities have been affected negatively due to errors on the map.""","Tourism operators in Australia claim inaccuracies in Google Maps are deterring potential visitors, by making remote attractions appear further away than they actually are."
"By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance reporter From 2019 they will get £8 a day if a fault is not fixed, paid as a refund through their bill. This is less than the £10 that was proposed when Ofcom began its consultation earlier this year. Providers will also have to pay £5 a day if their broadband or landline is not working on the day it was promised. If an engineer misses an appointment, they will have to give £25 in compensation. Ofcom has estimated as many as 2.6 million people could benefit from the new rules. £142m pay-outs The agreement covers consumers who have contracts with BT, Sky, Talk Talk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet - which make up around 90% of telecoms customers in the UK. Plusnet and EE are expected to join the scheme at a later date. How compensation will work ""Waiting too long for your landline or broadband to be fixed is frustrating enough, without having to fight for compensation,"" said Lindsey Fussell, Ofcom's consumer group director. ""So providers will have to pay money back automatically, whenever repairs or installations don't happen on time, or an engineer doesn't turn up. ""People will get the money they deserve, while providers will want to work harder to improve their service."" Ofcom said the scheme would not come in to operation until early 2019, because of the complexity of the changes. It said that billing systems and online accounts would need to be altered, and staff would need to be re-trained. Help In total, customers can expect to get £142m in pay-outs every year, according to Ofcom's estimates. At the moment telecoms users can get compensation in theory, but only around 15% of those who complain manage to get a refund. Even then most only get small amounts, said Ofcom. Anyone wanting to obtain compensation under the current arrangements can find help on the Ofcom website. Which? said that those providers who have not already joined the automatic compensation scheme should do so.","Householders who receive poor service from their telecoms provider are to get automatic compensation, the regulator Ofcom has announced."
"Slightly upgrading a previous forecast, the business lobby group said it expected growth of 1.6% for 2017 and 1.4% in 2018. However, this equates to average quarterly growth of 0.3% - half the rate seen in 2013 to 2016. The CBI described the outlook as ""steady but subdued"". It said UK exports were likely to increase over the next few years due to the weak pound, which has fallen by about 15% against the dollar since the UK referendum over EU membership. However, the CBI, which represents the interests of businesses in the UK, said rising inflation and low wage growth would hit domestic demand. ""People are already starting to feel the pinch,"" said Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI's director-general. ""Tighter purse strings mean slower household spending growth."" She said that after a ""frantic period"" in Westminster, the government needed to demonstrate that Britain was still a ""great place to do business"". She also called on negotiators on both sides to remain ""cool, calm and collected"" as they forged a deal over Brexit. ""The less likely a Brexit deal starts to look, the harder it will be for firms to recruit and retain talent as well as push the button on big investment decisions. We must get Brexit right."" In May, the Bank of England governor Mark Carney also warned of a consumer spending squeeze this year as inflation rises and real wages fall. The bank trimmed its economic growth forecasts for 2017 from 2% to 1.9%, and raised its forecast for inflation from 2.4% to 2.8%.","Growth in the UK will ""shift down a gear"" over the next few years as Brexit talks unfold and consumer spending slows, the CBI says."

Blackstone said it continued to view Dell as ""a leading global company with strong market positions"". But it also said that the two worrying conditions meant it was nevertheless withdrawing its interest in the company. Since Blackstone submitted its bid, Dell had reduced its operating income projections for the current year to $3 bn (£1.95bn), down from $3.7bn. Michael Dell, joined by private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners, has proposed a $24.4bn buyout of the company.

"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Climate change minister Lord Duncan of Springbank told a committee of MPs that the controversial system will allow ""technology to be our friend"". Eventually, residents would be able to choose real-time tariffs, to switch on appliances when energy is cheapest. The installation of smart meters has been riddled with delays and problems. A smart meter measures energy use, in the same way as a traditional gas or electricity meter. Unlike its predecessors, it sends that information directly to an energy supplier. Householders can track their energy use on a display screen, which should also show them the cost of how much they have used in pounds and pence. The ""Star Trek phase"" of the technology would allow residents to ""run the laundry"" at lower-cost times of day, owing to tariffs that allowed for a change in cost every half an hour, business minister Lord Duncan of Springbank told the Business Committee of MPs. Despite millions of pounds being spent on marketing, he added: ""There is still a relatively wide ignorance across the country about the value of smart meters."" Are smart meters compulsory? Consumers can turn down the offer of a smart meter, which is installed for free by their supplier. However, it is a government target for suppliers to install smart meters in at least 85% of customers' homes by the end of 2024. This target was, in effect, a four-year delay from the original plan for suppliers to take all reasonable steps to fit meters by the end of 2020. Last month, the government also revealed that it predicts only half of households will have a smart meter by 2020 and that the cost of the rollout will rise from £11bn in 2016 to £13.5bn - although total savings from the improved technology will also rise from £16.73bn to £19.56bn. Lord Duncan admitted there had been ""hiccups along the road"", but there were potentially ""big incentives"" for people to agree to a smart meter being fitted. He added that those who stuck with ""relic meters"" risked ""very high"" maintenance costs. Are smart meters still going dumb? There have been a series of glitches that have left customers frustrated. ""My smart meter loses connection, the weather seems to affect it, and it beeps all the time and the only way to stop it is to remove the batteries,"" Bryde Town, from Halifax, told BBC News earlier this year. More bizarrely, a handful in England showed displays in Welsh. The biggest annoyance for customers is that the first meters go ""dumb"", meaning that when they switch energy suppliers the meter loses its smart functionality and they have to go back to reading the meter again. About 14 million of these first generation SMETS1 have been fitted - many by British Gas. Mary Starks, from regulator Ofgem, said that suppliers were now expected to fit the second generation meters, which still worked when customers switched. She said all of the SMETS1 meters should be smart again by the end of next year, when they are switched onto the centralised system without the need for an engineer entering someone's house. But the committee heard that only 4,500 out of the 14 million first generation meters had been switched over so far.","Smart meters will reach a ""Star Trek phase"" - when the technology works to the financial benefit of consumers, a minister has promised."
"He wrote to 10 territories and crown dependencies, including the Cayman Islands and the Isle of Man, which operate low-tax regimes. Critics claim such places are used by companies for tax avoidance or evasion. The plea came ahead of a G8 summit in June, when the UK is expected to push for tighter tax measures. ""With one month to go, this is the crucial moment to get our own houses in order,"" Mr Cameron wrote in the letter. ""I respect your right to be lower tax jurisdictions... but lower taxes are only sustainable if what is owed is actually paid."" 'Complex arrangements The 10 territories that received the letter are Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Anguilla, Montserrat, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man. Some have been described by the UK government as having ""complex tax arrangements"". Low taxes and light touch regulation have seen some of them become major centres for international business. But the lack of transparency in their banking systems has left them open to accusations that they are being used to avoid paying taxes. Mr Cameron urged them to sign international protocols designed to allow tax information to be shared more easily between countries, and also to take measures to improve their own transparency. ""Put simply, that means we need to know who really owns and controls each and every company,"" he said. Tax avoidance, where companies operate within the rules to avoid paying taxes, and tax evasion, which is outside the law, have risen high on the political agenda in recent months. High-profile companies like Google, Amazon and Starbucks have faced criticism in the UK for the low levels of tax they appear to pay compared with the size of their businesses. On Sunday, Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt defended the company's tax affairs. He said the search engine giant ""has always aspired to do the right thing"", but added that ""international tax law could almost certainly benefit from reform"". Writing in the Observer, he said he wanted ""to move the debate forward"".","Prime Minister David Cameron has urged British overseas territories to ""get their house in order"" and sign up to international treaties on tax."
"By Helen MillerInstitute for Fiscal Studies They know that no voter wants to pay more, but they are also under pressure to fund manifesto pledges on public services. Here's why it is so difficult to find the perfect balance. 1. Money raised from taxes is nearing a historic high For every £1 created in the UK through economic activity - that's the working, spending and saving that we all do - the government collects roughly 37p. This adds up to about £700bn each year, which would be the equivalent of about £11,000 per person if the bill was split equally. Tax is the most important part of this - the equivalent of 34p in every £1. The rest of the government's income comes from a variety of sources. These include interest - for example on student loans; dividends - for example from holdings of Royal Bank of Scotland shares; and profits from assets - including the leasing of 4G mobile licences. Taxes have increased since 2010 and in 2020 revenues are due to reach the highest share of national income since the 1980s. 2. But there's still not enough money It's usually the case that governments don't have as much money as they want to spend. This year, for every £1 that it raises, the government will spend an extra 3p that it has borrowed. This gap between spending and revenues is called the deficit, and the amount borrowed each year adds to the national debt. The deficit increased substantially after the financial crisis of 2008, with attempts to limit it leading to large cuts to benefits and public services. Any plans for spending cuts lead to controversy about the amount or quality of services. But an ageing population and rising healthcare costs mean the government actually needs more money just to keep public services at their current level. This is a massive challenge for any would-be government and means difficult choices between raising taxes and reducing spending. 3. Some taxes raise much more than others Where the government decides to get its money is important because it determines who is being made worse off. The biggest chunk of overall revenue - about 40% - comes from income tax and national insurance contributions, both of which are based on your earnings. Overall, this amounts to about £300bn A further 30% - about £200bn - comes from taxes on the things we buy. This includes value added tax (VAT), which is a 20% tax on the cost of most things we buy, from pens and chocolate, to cars and fridges. Some goods attract additional taxes, for example fuel, cigarettes and alcohol. 4. Higher income households pay the most One of the key questions in any debate about tax is usually who's paying and who pays the most. Based on income, the top half of households contribute 78% of combined receipts for income tax, national insurance, VAT, excise duties and council tax. But this figure is actually an underestimate, because it relies on surveys that underestimate income tax paid by the highest income households. Tax returns are more reliable and show that income tax is very top-heavy. The top 1% of those who do pay income tax are responsible for 27% of revenues. The top half pays 90% of income tax. Four out of 10 adults pay no income tax because they are not working, or their income is too low. There is also a large system of benefits that increase the incomes of poorer households. There are two reasons income tax revenues are so concentrated at the top: inequality and the way taxes are designed - there are higher rates for higher earners. 5. Taxes change over time Politicians can decide what to tax and how high to set rates. In recent years, policy changes have led to national insurance, VAT and capital taxes becoming more important sources of revenue. Income tax, excise duties and corporation tax have become less important. Tax revenues also vary because of the state of the economy. Some, like corporation tax, fluctuate with the economy more than others, like council tax. 6. Tax is all about trade-offs No one likes paying tax and there is no harmless way to increase taxes - someone is always made worse off. This is even true of taxes that target businesses, rather than individuals, because the costs will ultimately be passed on - for example through higher prices, lower wages for workers or reduced dividends for shareholders. Taxes affect the choices individuals make, from how much to work, to how much effort to put in, how much to save and spend and what to buy. For all governments, there are difficult choices about how to raise - and spend - the money they need, while limiting the damage done. There is no easy answer.

"Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@KarishmaBBCon Twitter L Brooks Entwistle, Uber Asia Pacific's new chief business officer has acknowledged that the firm's reputation has taken a knock over sexual harassment scandals in the US, but added that he is focused on fixing these issues and growing the Asia market aggressively. Uber has struggled to maintain market share in Asia, and was forced to sell its China business to rival Didi Chuxing last year after losing an estimated billion dollars a year. As I wrote about at the time, the end of Uber's China dream was a huge loss of face for then CEO and founder Travis Kalanick, who once famously said success in China meant being number one. No ""exit strategy"" There have been concerns that Uber could face the same fate in the wider region, but Mr Entwistle told me there's no way that something like that would happen. ""This [Asia] is a big part of the world,"" he tells me in Uber's downtown Singapore office. ""It's 20% of rides, there's a huge percentage of drivers, it's a growth market across the region for us."" ""We need to do what we can to contribute to that. So there's no exit strategy for Asia."" Them sound like fighting words, given the current scenario in the ride-hailing industry in Asia. Across the region local rivals are giving Uber a run for its money. In South East Asia, home-grown rival Grab run by Malaysian tycoon Anthony Tan is making inroads by capturing market share in seven major Asian cities, including the jewel in the crown - Singapore. It's also raised billions of dollars of investments from Japan's Softbank and China's Didi Chuxing. In India, Uber is having to fend off competition from Ola which has the backing of Didi too. Add to that regulatory uncertainty and the allegations of sexual harassment and mismanagement in the US, and it's easy to see how Uber has lost its first mover advantage in this region. But Mr Entwistle insists that all is well. ""We are not thinking about losing countries,"" he says. ""We are thinking about gaining countries and market share in these countries. It is very much a growth game."" But the reality is that Uber's rivals in Asia are closing in on that gap. Grab opened in Myanmar earlier this year and while Uber has also offered its services in Yangon too, many analysts say local players have an edge in this region because they understand the market better. Mr Entwistle is quick to point out the global appeal of Uber though, by emphasising the company's wide reach. ""We are a global organisation of 600 cities in 77 countries in six continents,"" he tells me confidently. ""We bring a global approach to local markets."" Problems to fix The former Goldman Sachs banker turned tech boss has only been in the job for a couple of months. He tells me that Cambodia is the next market for Uber in Asia and that going deeper into existing markets is the strategy for success in the region. But it's not just competition that Uber has to contend with. The recent sexual harassment scandal, allegations of trade theft and boardroom turmoil have all dented the global brand and left it preoccupied with fixing the company culture rather than focusing on growth. Mr Entwistle acknowledges there are problems to fix. ""Uber grew incredibly fast since inception,"" he says, ""and some of the processes and culture didn't keep apace with that growth. I can tell you having just come on board recently that... everyone is totally focused on that [company culture]"". Mr Entwistle also adds that ""we aren't perfect yet but we're working hard to get there"". He will have his work cut out. Asia is becoming an increasingly competitive ride-hailing market, and Uber is no longer the only player in town. But the two time Mount Everest climber and father of three daughters is no stranger to challenges, and as Mr Entwistle says in his LinkedIn blog looking for new approaches to old problems goes with the territory. He would do well to heed his own advice.",The new boss of Uber in Asia has said there is no way it will sell out of the ride-hailing business in this region. His first detailed comments about his strategy come as the firm struggles against competitors and its tarnished global brand.
"By Tom EspinerBusiness reporter, BBC News The firm is suing Mr Tinkler for ""breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty"", it said. Mr Tinkler claimed the board had defamed him as part of a legal dispute with Stobart Group. He is seeking to remove chairman Iain Ferguson in a vote at the firm's AGM. Mr Tinkler was chief executive of Stobart Group for a decade until he stepped aside last year to focus on a firm called Stobart Capital, but remained on the Stobart board. The dispute between Mr Tinkler and Mr Ferguson erupted after Mr Tinkler came up with a proposal late last year to buy the airline Flybe. Relations deteriorated between Mr Tinkler and the firm last month when he told the board he planned to oppose the re-election of Mr Ferguson as chairman at Stobart Group's annual meeting on 28 June. Mr Tinkler, former director Allan Jenkinson, and Neil Woodford of Woodford Investment Management have banded together to try to oust Mr Ferguson as chairman. Together, they control about a third of the shares in the company. They are seeking to replace Mr Ferguson with Philip Day, chief executive of Edinburgh Woollen Mill Group. However, Invesco, which has about a 24% holding, has declined to support the move. The firm responded on 29 May by advising investors to re-elect Mr Ferguson. Mr Tinkler has alleged this letter was defamatory and is suing five directors for defamation. Tax charge In recent weeks Stobart Group has begun pursuing Mr Tinkler in the courts for a tax liability it says is worth £3.8m plus interest. This week the law firm Rosenblatt sent Mr Tinkler's lawyers a letter that has been seen by the BBC. The letter alleges that he tried to profit from the proposed Flybe deal in a way that would have been detrimental to Stobart Group. The letter also alleges that Mr Tinkler has taken ""numerous and substantial"" expenses out of the company. Mr Tinkler said the allegations in the Rosenblatt letter contained ""malicious falsehoods"" and that he will ""rigorously defend himself against the chairman and chief executive's attempts to defame him"". Stobart Group, which is worth more than £800m, is separate from the road transport firm Eddie Stobart Logistics. That firm is also listed on the London market and is worth just over £500m.",Stobart Group has sacked former boss Andrew Tinkler from the board in the latest twist in a bitter power struggle at the owner of Southend and Carlislie airports.
"Kamal AhmedBusiness editor@bbckamalon Twitter So why has there been the major fall in what are known as like-for-like sales - that's sales in its stores and online stripping out the effect of new stores opening (of which there are hardly any). Sales are down nearly 4%, and in the retail world that is significant. Tesco has not seen numbers this bad, it is admitting internally, for 20 years. One retail analyst from HSBC has said that the fall is equivalent to a million customers a week spending £25 less. Some believe Tesco is becalmed in the middle ground, a no-man's land between Waitrose at the top end - sales up 6% - and Aldi and Lidl at the discount end, where sales are up 36% and 28% respectively. But Asda, which may be expected to be suffering in the same way as one of the four big traditional retailers, is performing better with sales up. What's going on here? Tesco is suffering from what is known as the deflation effect - it recently announced cuts in prices for core products like milk and eggs. That has a negative effect on like-for-like sales, which are based on total revenue quarter by quarter. You have to sell a lot litres of milk at £1 (the new discount price) to gain the same revenue from selling milk at, say, £1.50. Any volume increase takes a while to be reflected in the numbers. Asda bit the bullet more than two years ago with price cuts and is now reaping the benefits. Philip Clarke, Tesco's chief executive, has said that Tesco's figures will remain pretty grim for a while. The deflation effect can take a whole year to work its way through, meaning there will be some pretty tricky quarters ahead. Mr Clarke is betting that rather than take on the discounters at their own game - a game he thinks Tesco will never win - it is better to offer ""Tesco for everyone"". So, you can buy a litre of milk from Tesco, you can get a pretty cheap own-label tablet (the Tesco Hudl), you can have a coffee at a Harris + Hoole cafe, you can go to a Giraffe restaurant with your children, you can get an ISA from Tesco's own bank, online they sell not just Tesco products via ""marketplace"" but are plotting to be a competitor to Amazon by selling other retailers' goods as well. They have an online entertainment service, Blinkbox, a mobile phone service, 16 million Clubcard customers to cross-sell to, a huge petrol business . . . the list is endless. Mr Clarke says that a long term focus on a wide range of products is the way to turn the business around. Of course, the core offer - the food - must also be up to standard and at the right price. Mr Clarke says that the board are wholly signed up to the strategy. Internally his mantra, I have been told, is ""keep calm and carry on"". The retail industry is still re-finding its feet after the 2008 crash. Tesco, Mr Clarke admits privately, was too slow to change. His critics say that by the end of the year like-for-like sales will have to be on the way up if the chief executive is to feel comfortable in his job. Revamped stores will have to show growth. Online, a small proportion (around 7%) of overall sales, will need to show continued, profitable progress. The international businesses will have to improve. With the share price under pressure (down 20% in a year) the big question will be whether the share holders - the people that own the company - will give Mr Clarke the time he says he needs.",Tesco is like a juggernaut with a puncture and a worrying rattle in the engine. It's still a pretty big lorry of course - let's not forget that it made £3.3bn of profits last year (admittedly down 6%) and still accounts for 29% of all supermarket trade in the UK (down from over 30%).
"BBC News asked Citizens Advice to answer the 20 most commonly asked questions. 1. Can a landlord kick me out without a reason, and how much notice should I be given? Your landlord can't evict you during the fixed term of a tenancy unless you breach a term in the tenancy agreement, such as not paying rent or damaging the property, unless there is a break clause in your agreement. If you stay in the home beyond the fixed term and your landlord wants possession without a reason, they must give you at least two months' notice, often called a section 21 notice. There are a number of rules the landlord must follow for the notice to be valid. The landlord must apply to court for possession of the property if you don't leave when the notice expires. You should get advice from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice, if you receive a notice. In Scotland, residential tenancies are open-ended, so tenants cannot be asked to leave simply because they have come to the end of the tenancy. If the landlord has grounds to evict the tenant, they must give 28 days' notice if the tenant has lived in the property for six months or less, or 84 days notice if the tenant has lived there for more than six months. For specific grounds, such as a criminal conviction, the notice is 28 days irrespective of how long they have been in the property. In Northern Ireland, once the fixed term is up, landlords must give four weeks' written notice, known as a Notice to Quit. 2. Can a landlord increase rent at any time, and how much notice should I be given? Your rent cannot normally be increased unless you agree or the tenancy agreement allows it. A rent review clause in a fixed-term tenancy will not apply after the fixed term ends, if your tenancy becomes ""statutory periodic"". This is when your fixed term ends and your tenancy automatically continues month-by-month or week-by-week - usually based on your rent payment period - until you or your landlord gives notice. Landlords of periodic tenants can use special procedures to raise rents by giving you a formal notice, details of which are set down in law. This can be appealed against in England to the first-tier property tribunal, or to the rent assessment committee in Wales, which will determine a ""market rent"" for the property. In Scotland, landlords can increase rent once a year but must give three months' written notice. Tenants can contact their local authority rent officer if they think the increase is too high For Northern Ireland, once the fixed term is up, there are no limits to rent increases, either by how much or how often a landlord can raise the rent. 3. What can I do if my landlord fails to do basic repairs, deal with pests etc? First, ensure you are not responsible for the repairs. Tenants are usually expected to do small maintenance jobs such as changing a light bulb or repairing damage they have caused. If the landlord is not doing repairs they are responsible for, speak to them first to make sure they understand your concerns. If this does not help you can make a formal complaint by writing a letter to your landlord, explaining the problem, what you want them to do and including any evidence you have. If this does not solve your problem you can go to your council, which can help with complaints about repairs that cause a risk to health and safety. Your council can look at your home and order the landlord to do the repairs if they think it is harmful to your health or safety. Some landlords may try to evict a tenant who complains about repairs - so-called ""retaliatory eviction"". There is some legal protection for tenants in this position but talk to Citizens Advice if you're worried about this risk. You should not withhold rent because of repair issues because your landlord may then have reason to evict you. Eviction by coercion may be an illegal eviction in Scotland, which is a criminal offence. Scotland has had the Repairing Standard set of rules since September 2017. A tenant can refer the matter to the Housing and Property Chamber First Tier Tribunal for Scotland. In Northern Ireland, there is no legal protection against retaliatory eviction. 4. When can a landlord withhold my deposit after I move out? Most deposits should be protected in a tenancy deposit scheme and a landlord cannot take money from your deposit without either your agreement or arbitration by the scheme. A landlord who has failed to protect a deposit may have to pay a penalty to the tenant and face restrictions on serving notice. You might not get the full amount of your deposit back if, for example, you owe rent, you have damaged the property or you have lost or broken items on the inventory. Landlords should not take money for reasonable wear and tear, such as a carpet that has gradually worn out over time, or to fix repairs that were their responsibility. 5. How long does he or she have to return my deposit? If your deposit is in a tenancy deposit scheme, you should get your deposit back within 10 days of agreeing any deductions with your landlord. If you cannot reach agreement, you will need to check how to access arbitration with your scheme. If your deposit has not been protected, seek help from Citizens Advice about recovering your deposit through the court. Your landlord may also have to pay you a penalty for failing to protect your deposit. Scotland has similar deposit protection schemes. In Northern Ireland, your landlord has 30 days to get your deposit back to you after agreeing any deductions. 6. If we are in dispute, can a landlord seize my belongings? Your landlord has a legal obligation to look after any of your belongings left in a property after you have moved out or been evicted. They must make reasonable efforts to trace you, and serve you with notice - usually 28 days, but three months if you owe them money - stating how you can collect the goods, and that they will be disposed of if they have not been collected by the expiry of the notice. If the goods remain uncollected, the landlord may sell or dispose of them and make a deduction from any proceeds for expenses reasonably incurred in storage or disposal. The balance will belong to the tenant. 7. If a housemate moves out, whose responsibility is it to find a replacement? If you have a joint tenancy with your housemate - each tenant is legally liable for the whole of the rent. This means, for example, that if they don't pay the landlord could pursue you, and any other joint tenants, for the money. If your housemate is a joint tenant and wants to leave during the fixed term, they could find a replacement agreed by you and the landlord. It is a good idea to put the agreement in writing so everyone knows where they stand. Without finding a replacement, your housemate would either have to continue paying rent in order not to breach the tenancy, or come to an agreement for them to pay you to make up the shortfall. In each case, the landlord must agree to the change before you can go ahead as they need to agree to the surrender of the existing joint tenancy and the creation of a new tenancy. If you are having problems you should get advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. For tenants in Northern Ireland, check your agreement to see if you are ""jointly and severally liable"". If you are, each tenant is liable for the rent of another who leaves; if not, the landlord would have to pursue the tenant for unpaid rent. 8. What is the procedure if I lose my keys? If you do not have a spare set of keys then you should check if your landlord or their agent has a spare set of keys you can use to get a new set cut. Your tenancy agreement might also give details about how you can do this and any fees you will be charged for a replacement. If there is no a spare set you can contact a locksmith to get the locks changed but you will have to pay for this and will also be responsible for any damage caused, for example, to the door or doorframe. Check your tenancy agreement to see if you have to tell your landlord if you change the locks. 9. What should the landlord do if I am harassed by a housemate? You should try to speak to your housemate first to see if you can find a way forward, but only do this if you feel able to do so. Your landlord may be able to help you by speaking to the housemate but there is no duty for them to do so. Your landlord may be able to take action to evict the housemate if they have breached the tenancy agreement in some way but this can take time. If you're a joint tenant and your housemate is evicted this would also end your tenancy so it is worth getting advice first. If you are in fear of violence or if you are being racially or sexually harassed you should contact the police. 10. Can a landlord come into the property whenever they want? The landlord has a right to reasonable access to carry out repairs for which they are responsible and to inspect the property, but usually they must give 24 hours' notice in writing. In most cases, a landlord does not have the right to demand access without notice, or to enter the property without permission when the tenant is not there. In Northern Ireland, the notice does not need to be in writing. 11. I have a disability. Can I demand the landlord make a property suitably accessible? If you have a disability and are having accessibility trouble in your home, you can ask your landlord to either make adaptations or let you make the changes. If your landlord refuses, seek advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. Disabled facility grants from local councils - or the Housing Executive in Northern Ireland - are available to landlords and tenants to cover the costs of adaptations in some circumstances. 12. Can a landlord refuse someone receiving housing benefits, or Universal Credit? Not all landlords and letting agents allow housing benefit or housing costs payments through Universal Credit, but you only need to say you receive them if they ask. You might be able to get a landlord or letting agent to accept you by giving extra references or you could also get a guarantor (someone who agrees to pay the rent if you don't). Ask your council if they have a list of landlords and letting agents who will rent to people who are getting Housing Benefit or Universal Credit, although this does not apply in Northern Ireland. 13. Can I be charged for wear and tear, and how does the landlord decide on the amount? Check your tenancy agreement to see if you have agreed to leave the property in a certain condition. In general, you shouldn't be charged for wear and tear, but the landlord might ask you to pay for damage beyond that. If you've paid a deposit, the landlord might ask for that payment to be deducted from the deposit. If you can't agree, you can ask the tenancy deposit scheme that holds your deposit to make a decision. 14. Can a landlord check my credit rating to see if I am at risk of failing to pay my rent? Yes they can, but they must ask for your permission first. If you plan to rent through a letting agent and have bad credit history, tell them before they take any fees as you may not get these back. If the landlord refuses you because he thinks there is a risk of you not paying the rent, you could offer rent in advance if you can afford it, or a guarantor - if one is available - to secure the property. 15. How much can a lettings agent charge for administration fees? Most lettings agents will charge you to check your references and credit - the amount you can be asked to pay can vary a lot between agents. You might also be asked to pay fees if you renew your tenancy. Ask about your letting agent's fees before taking the property and before you pay any money. Their fees must be displayed on their website and in their offices. They have to give you details of their fees before you agree to rent. It is against the law for your letting agent to charge you for registering with them and giving information or lists of properties available for rent, although this may not apply in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, there is a mandatory register of lettings agents. Apart from rent and the security deposit, letting fees have been banned in Scotland since 2012. 16. Can a landlord prevent me from having friends or family to stay overnight? You are entitled to ""quiet enjoyment"" of your home, which includes having the occasional overnight visitor. In some cases tenants will be held responsible for the behaviour of their visitors that could lead to renters breaching their tenancy agreement. Any term in a tenancy agreement that says you can't have overnight guests without permission from the landlord or that you have to pay a fee is likely to be ""unfair"" and unenforceable. You should bear in mind the risk of eviction if you are outside a fixed term and you antagonise your landlord. Be clear your guest is a visitor and you're not sub-letting. Most tenancy agreements say that you are not allowed to sub-let all or part of your property without your landlord's agreement. If your guest pays money to stay it's likely to be seen as sub-let. 17. What can I do if I think I'm being discriminated against for ethnicity, religion or nationality? If you think you are being discriminated against because of your disability, gender reassignment, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex or sexual orientation, you may be able to take legal action. You should get advice from an experienced adviser, like Citizens Advice. 18. If I'm evicted at short notice, where can I go? You should seek help immediately from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice. An adviser will be able to check whether your landlord has followed the correct procedure to evict you and whether you have rights to be allowed back into your property. They should also be able to help you with finding alternative accommodation. Also, if you are homeless, your local council may have to help find you somewhere to live. Depending on your circumstances, they might also provide you with emergency accommodation. Again, an independent adviser will be able to help you with this application. In Northern Ireland, the Housing Executive may have to help you find somewhere to live. 19. What should I do if I am struggling to pay the rent on time? If you need help to pay your rent you may be able to apply for housing benefit or for help with your housing costs from Universal Credit. You may also be entitled to other benefits if you are unemployed or on a low income. If you are struggling with debt, seek help from an independent adviser, like Citizens Advice. 20. Are there any specific issues in Wales and Scotland? Landlords must be registered in Wales. If you feel your landlord has done something wrong, check your landlord is registered as there are financial penalties if they're not. If the landlord holds a licence, it may be revoked for not following the code of conduct. In Scotland, landlords must register with the local council. The local authority must be satisfied that the owner of the property and the agent are fit and proper to let residential property, before registering them. Tenants can search the register and it is an offence for a landlord not to register. This advice applies to assured shorthold tenants, and most private tenancies in Northern Ireland. In Scotland, a new tenancy law was enacted in December 2017, affecting new tenancies from 1 December 2017, and the differences are explained where possible.","Millions of people pay monthly rent to a landlord for a room or a home, but many will be unclear about their rights as a tenant."

Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA, said that the firm had previously committed to mend its online booking service following another investigation. However, the CMA has identified new issues with the ticket sellers' website. It is concerned that StubHub has been: Dr Coscelli said it was ""unacceptable that we have now found these concerns.

StubHub executive Wayne Grierson said: ""We have always collaborated closely with regulators in the interests of our fans, and will continue to do so."" He added that StubHub was working quickly to resolve any ""remaining valid concerns"" the CMA held over information on its website. Merger investigation The CMA also said that if the changes made don't go far enough it will consider taking court action. Last year, the regulator ruled that hotel booking websites had to review they way they rank and display rooms, over ""pressure-selling"" concerns. Consumer group Which? later found that hotel booking websites' ""only 1 room left on our site"" claims still failed to give an accurate picture of availability. A separate investigation is underway by the CMA, looking into Viagogo's purchase of StubHub. Viagogo said in 2019 it was buying rival tickets firm StubHub from eBay, which bought the company for $310m (£238m) in 2007. The CMA is considering whether or not the deal will lead to a ""substantial lessening of competition"" in ticket selling. Viagogo was previously ordered by the courts to tell buyers which seats they will get and if there is a risk they could be turned away at the door.",The UK's competition watchdog has warned StubHub that it could face court action if it does not make changes to its website.
"By Richard WestcottBBC Transport correspondent Seven A few years ago it was voted one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the highly respected American Society of Civil Engineers. That puts it in the same league as the Empire State Building, the Panama Canal and the Golden Gate Bridge. (Also on the list by the way, the North Sea Protection Works, which is worth looking up online.) 830 At around 830m (that's 907 yards) Eurotunnel tell me their car trains are the longest in Europe. They're also pulled by the most powerful locomotives in the world. 1802 They have been talking about a Channel Tunnel since the beginning of the 19th Century. Napoleon liked the idea but the Brits didn't fancy the prospect of being invaded from a giant hole. Since then there have been dozens of proposed schemes. They even dug half a mile underneath Kent in the 1880s, and the old tunnel is still there today. Again, a fundamental mistrust of the French stopped it in its tracks. The best idea that I've read about though, (I do so hope it's true), was for an ice tunnel, that could be deliberately melted by switching off the refrigeration units if an invading army fancied sneaking across. Brilliant. It has been suggested that a Channel Tunnel could have shortened World War One by two years because the British could have used it to supply their troops more effectively. Quite a sobering thought that, especially as we remember the 100th anniversary this year. 40 It runs 40m (131ft) under the seabed. None of it goes through water. I was allowed to take a stroll through the service tunnel. Honestly, it's spooky. One It was finished a year late. 4 billion It cost £4bn ($6.7bn) more than the original estimate, and that's without interest payments. 2007 Buckling under the sheer weight of debt, the owners were stumbling towards bankruptcy until a last-minute restructuring in 2007-08. 2012 All things considered, 2012 was the first year that this leviathan of a project actually turned a profit. The owners now say they're going from strength to strength. Three There have been three fires caused by lorries on trains. They now have an intensive, automatic spraying system to douse any flames (on top of dedicated safety teams and equipment). Also three There are actually three tunnels. Two for trains and a smaller, service tunnel down the middle (the one I walked down). It can be used as a ""lifeboat"" to get people out during an emergency. That is what happened in 2008 after the worst blaze, when a lorry caught fire seven miles from the French entrance. It took months to repair the damage caused by the 1000C heat. Two Two of the 11, mighty boring machines used to dig the thing are still down there, buried. Funnily enough, they don't fit them with a reverse gear, so it was cheaper to put in a 90-degree turn and bury them in the wall, rather than dismantle them and bring them out. The other machines are on show all over the place. At least one is a sculpture in the middle of a car roundabout in France. A couple Back in the early 1990s they didn't have the pinpoint tunnelling machines they have today. They used lasers to guide them but engineers didn't know for certain they'd meet up in the middle until a bloke with a pneumatic drill knocked through the wall, and didn't get wet. It turns out they were just a couple of millimetres out. By the way, the Brits got a bit further than the French, so they didn't quite meet in the middle, but the French did face tougher geological and engineering issues (apparently). 85 Around 85% of the people taking their cars and vans through are basically from Britain. Only around 6% are French. So it turns out we like driving in France far more than they like driving here. They must have seen the M25 (M6, A14 etc etc). 20 Years old today.","It is 20 years since the Channel Tunnel was officially opened. Both Queen Elizabeth II and France's President Francois Mitterrand attended the initial ceremony in Calais on 6 May 1994, before travelling through the Tunnel, or le tunnel sous la Manche in French, for a similar event marking its opening, in Folkestone. It is impossible to explain all 31.4 miles (or 50.5km) of the Channel Tunnel without using lots of numbers. So here goes."
"The US company sells expensive stationary bikes and provides on-demand workout sessions. Peloton said it would price shares at up to $29, giving it a potential market valuation of more than $8.2bn. The planned Nasdaq listing follows disappointing debuts from Uber and Lyft. Founded in 2012, the New York-based company sells fitness equipment - with bikes priced at around $2,000 - fitted with touchscreens. Users then purchase a subscription to access classes streamed live and on-demand. The firm said it has more than 1.4 million members. ""On the most basic level, Peloton sells happiness,"" founder John Foley previously said. In a regulatory filing, the firm said it plans to offer 46 million shares, priced between $26 and $29 per share. That would give the company a market value of up to $8.2bn. Peloton's most recent earnings report showed a rise in revenues but the company fell short of turning a profit. For the year ended 30 June, revenues more than doubled to $915m while its net loss widened $195.6m from $47.9m. The planned listing comes on the heels of several high-profile US stock debuts. Uber and Lyft both went public this year but drew criticism over their heavy losses. WeWork's stock market debut - one of the most hotly anticipated financial events of the year - is also in doubt. The company rents office space for the long-term, subletting that space to firms and individuals on more flexible lease terms. SoftBank, the Japanese investment firm that owns about 30% of WeWork, has reportedly urged the property company to drop its flotation plans. The pressure follows signs that outside investors do not value the much-hyped firm as highly as SoftBank did when it invested last year.","Fitness start-up Peloton plans to raise up to $1.3bn (£1.1bn) in an initial public offering, the latest loss-making firm gearing up for its market debut."
"The charge of £2 will begin on 28 July, but will only apply to goods costing less than £30. The department store, which announced the move on Wednesday, said the current system was ""unsustainable"". It said it handles six million click and collect orders a year, up from 350,000 in 2008 when the service began. The charge will also apply to orders for collection at Waitrose, which is part of the John Lewis group. A spokesperson for the company said that all click and collect orders were processed at distribution centres and then delivered to the designated shop, which incurred costs. Last year, 18% of click and collect orders were less than £30. Debenhams and Marks and Spencer said they have no plans to charge for their click and collect services.","John Lewis has said it will start charging to use its click and collect service, where customers buy goods online and pick them up in store."
"Helen ThomasNewsnight business editor And it is a figure still being used. On Wednesday, the government said this of its planned cap on energy price: ""This would protect around two-thirds of households."" Except that doesn't appear to be right. Market breakdown According to regulator Ofgem's latest figures - which the government says it's using - about 15 million households are on standard variable tariffs, which on average are about £300 a year more expensive than the cheapest offers available. That is out of 27 million UK households, or about 55% of the total. In fairness, that is still a big chunk of the market. And two years ago 17 million UK households were on standard variable tariffs - a lot closer to the government's two-thirds figure. But this still overstates the number of people who stand to benefit from the government's plans to instruct Ofgem to cap these SVTs, which households roll onto when a fixed offer comes to an end. About three million of these households who use prepayment meters are already protected by a price cap introduced by the regulator in April this year. That was the first step in a widely-welcomed push to protect ""vulnerable"" households - those who, for whatever reason, find it harder to switch to the cheaper tariffs offered by more than 50 upstart energy providers. This leaves 12 million, or about 44% of UK households, paying those high SVT rates. Already protected Except Ofgem this week proposed extending its price cap protection to about one million households receiving the Warm Home Discount from February. And it said it was working on offering that protection to a further two million households from next winter. Now the government has conceded its market-wide cap on standard variable tariffs won't be in force until next winter. It has passed the tricky task of designing and setting the cap to Ofgem. So by the time it comes into force, about nine million households - or one-third of the market - could be on the higher standard variable tariffs without any type of price protection already in place. That doesn't take account of another year in which households paying over the odds can switch to one of the cheaper tariffs on offer. Three years Remember, the part of the market that the government is really trying to help is the households who have been on a standard variable tariff for more than three years. Those are the people that, for whatever reason, seem to be stuck paying over the odds. And Ofgem's data show that low-income households, those living in rented social housing, those aged 65 or older or those with a disability are more likely not to have switched supplier in the last three years. Unfortunately, it is hard to break the market down much further. Ofgem's latest data from April looks at customer accounts rather than households (and where a household has a separate supplier for gas and electricity that can mean double counting). But those figures suggest that of all non-prepayment accounts on SVTs, about 55-60% had been in that position for more than three years. If the regulator has got it right, those accounts should be those that benefit from the proposals announced this week. Which implies - albeit very roughly - that the remaining slice of the market who have been stuck on SVT long-term but won't be protected by next winter should be reasonably small. And this is where designing an effective price cap gets tricky. Ofgem must try to reduce energy costs meaningfully for that subsection of the market that is stuck on pricey tariffs and won't already have been helped by already announced measures. But it has been instructed to do so in a way that doesn't reduce the incentive for the rest of the market to shop around for the best deal.","You'll have seen the stat. Two-thirds of UK households on rip-off energy tariffs, or words to that effect."
"Customers whose flights have been axed will also receive an email, chief executive Michael O'Leary has said. The budget airline is cancelling 40-50 flights every day for the next six weeks, after it admitted it had ""messed up"" the planning of pilot holidays. Mr O'Leary said most people would be transferred to an alternative Ryanair flight on the same day. If not, they would be moved to flights the day before or the day after, and the airline would meet its obligations over compensation. Details of all the cancelled flights are available on the Ryanair website. More than 200 of the cancelled flights are either into or out of London Stansted, with a handful in Edinburgh, Manchester and Birmingham also affected. The airline said it was cancelling flights at airports where it ran the busiest schedules, so it would be easier to accommodate passengers on alternative flights. Rome, Milan, Brussels and Barcelona airports will also see a significant number of flights, either or in or out, cancelled. Mr O'Leary said around 400,000 passengers would be directly affected, but he said a decision had been made to disrupt the plans of 2% of travellers in order to offer a better service to the remaining customers. Changes to the way the airline organises its holiday year have left Ryanair with a backlog of staff leave, meaning there is a shortage of pilots on standby over the next six weeks. That meant any minor disruptions to flights, due to problems with air traffic control capacity, strikes, or weather disruptions were causing knock-on delays, because the airline did not have the flexibility it needed from back-up crews, said Mr O'Leary. After 1 November, when the lighter winter schedule begins, there will not be any need for cancellations, he said. He said they were also asking to buy back leave from pilots and alter the holiday schedule. Mr O'Leary said Ryanair would honour all of its obligations to compensate passengers under EU regulations but would not book passengers onto flights with rival carriers. ""We will not pay for flights on other airlines, no. It is not part of the EU261 entitlement,"" he said, referring to European passenger rights legislation. He said the airline did not have an overall shortage of pilots, but said they had ""messed up"" the rosters for September and October. ""This is our mess-up. When we make a mess in Ryanair we come out with our hands up,"" he said. ""We try to explain why we've made the mess and we will pay compensation to those passengers who are entitled to compensation, which will be those flights that are cancelled over the next two weeks."" If passengers are given more than 14 days' notice of a cancellation, they are not entitled to compensation. The EU compensation rules for cancelled flights are as follows:",Ryanair has published full details of which of its flights are being cancelled between now and 28 October.
"The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure was the lowest in nearly two years, pushed down by petrol price falls. The inflation reading was in line with analysts' expectations. The figure is close to the Bank of England's target of 2% and may mean the Bank is less likely now to consider any rate rises in the near future. Inflation is being outstripped by average UK pay growth, with the most recent available figures showing that wages excluding bonuses were up by 3.3% for the three months to October 2018. Toys and hobbies The head of inflation at the ONS, Mike Hardie, said: ""Inflation eased mainly due to a big fall in petrol, with oil prices tumbling in recent months. ""Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year. These were partially offset by small rises in hotel prices and mobile phone charges. ""House price growth was little changed in the year to November, with buoyant growth across much of the UK held back by London and the South East."" Analysis: Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent What's striking about the inflation figures isn't so much what they tell you about the cost of living. It's what they suggest about interest rates. In October, traders in the City were betting the Bank of England would seek to head off inflationary pressure and take some heat out of the economy by raising interest rates again by May. Pay rises had started to improve significantly, fuelling fears employers would have to start boosting prices to pay those higher labour costs and keep up their profits. In order to head off inflation and keep it close to the 2% target over the next two years, so the logic went, interest rates would have to rise sooner rather than later. But now the betting is a rate rise won't happen before November. And part of the reason may be Brexit-related uncertainty. In other words (so the theory goes) Brexit-related uncertainty is causing consumers to pull their horns in and businesses to hold back on new investment. Therefore there's less demand for the goods or services they wish to buy, and therefore less upwards pressure on prices. Therefore, in turn, there's less need for an early rise in interest rates. This might be some comfort if you're stuck with a huge mortgage, concerned about exactly when the next quarter-point rise in interest rates will come. Think of it as a modest silver lining to the gathering clouds of Brexit-related uncertainty. The price of petrol fell by 6.4p per litre on the month to 121.7p, which was the lowest price since April 2018. Diesel fell by 4.6p to 131.9p per litre, the weakest since July 2018. These downward effects were offset by upward contributions from a variety of categories, including accommodation services and, to a lesser extent, mobile phone charges, games, toys, hobbies and food. Raw materials Inflation peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, but is now at its lowest since January of that year. The ONS said consumer prices over the fourth quarter as a whole were 2.27% higher than a year previously, a smaller rise than the 2.47% forecast by the Bank of England in November. The inflation figures also pointed to less short-term pressure in the pipeline for consumer prices, the ONS added. For manufacturers, the cost of raw materials - many imported - was 3.7% up on December 2017, down steeply from annual inflation of 5.3% in November and marking the weakest increase since June 2016. 'On track' Examining the possibility of interest rate rises, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""With inflation within a whisker of its 2% target, the [Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee] will probably feel comfortable in waiting until Brexit uncertainty is resolved before moving again. The fall in CPI inflation from 2.3% in November to 2.1% in December was bang in line with the consensus forecasts. Note that the MPC predicted in December that CPI inflation would fall to 1.75% by January. So the committee's forecasts are on track."" She said that Ofgem's energy price cap on utility prices should subtract 0.2 percentage points from CPI inflation in January and, looking ahead further in the year, that inflation should remain below the Bank's 2% target for much of the year. Stephen Clarke, senior economics analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said the easing of inflation provides a ""welcome relief to households amid wider economic uncertainty"". He added: ""Assuming very damaging Brexit outcomes are avoided, a tight labour market continuing to put upward pressure on pay should mean 2019 is set to be a better - if not great - year for wages.""","The UK inflation rate fell to 2.1% in December, from 2.3% the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS)."
"Imports also fell for the month by 16.1% in yuan terms, compared with forecasts for a fall of about 12%. That means the country's trade surplus has risen to 210.2 billion yuan (£21bn; $32.4bn) from 18.6bn yuan in March. Recent economic data from the mainland has shown further signs that China's slowdown is continuing. ""[The surplus rise] was mainly due to further import weakness,"" said Moody's analyst Alistair Chan in a note. ""Imports have slowed on account of the housing slump and reduced demand for commodities, while exports have been softened on account of the uneven global recovery,"" he said. Economist Tony Nash of Delta Economics said there was clearly pressure on China's trade environment. ""But the environment is improving and will continue through the second quarter,"" he said. ""We see some difficulties in the third quarter, with recovery late in the year."" In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 6.4%, while imports fell 16.2%, and the trade surplus rose to $34.13bn. Some official numbers from the mainland are now reported by media in both currencies, because of currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year. China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years.",China's monthly trade data has shown exports fell in April from a year ago by 6.2% in yuan terms compared to expectations for a rise of about 1.5%.
"Sales volumes fell by 0.6% from November, the fifth month in a row without growth, the Office for National Statistics said. It comes amid worries about economic growth and forecasts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates soon. Food stores were hard hit, with the quantity bought falling by the biggest amount since December 2016. ""Anecdotal evidence from a number of stores stated that goods did not sell as well as expected,"" the ONS said. The latest figures are published as UK High Streets continue to face tough trading conditions, with big chains such as Mothercare and Thomas Cook going bust in recent months. The December 2019 figures, unlike those for the same month in 2018, include Black Friday sales, but the ONS said it had seasonally adjusted its data to account for this shift. Trading statements for the Christmas season from the country's biggest supermarkets had already indicated that households spent less on festive fare in 2019 than they had the previous year. Sales at food stores fell 1.3% in December from the previous month, the ONS said. Department stores were also under pressure, with sales down 1.8% month-on-month, as were clothing stores, which saw a 2% fall in sales. This is yet more proof, if it were needed, that December was tough for retailers. The so-called golden quarter was far from sparkling and it's clear that it failed to deliver what many businesses wanted. Black Friday, which came late this year, really has shifted the pattern of spending, with sales simply being pulled forward instead of boosting overall spending. Despite wages now rising faster than inflation, and healthier household finances overall, retail isn't getting its share of spending from disposable income that it once did. But amid the gloom, some retailers have done well by giving customers what they want as well along with selling the right products at the right price. Household goods and fuel were the only sectors that saw an increase. Online sales accounted for 19% of December's retail spending, up from 18.6% the previous month. Last week, the British Retail Consortium said 2019 had been the worst year for retailers since 1995. ""The picture we're seeing from trading figures is that shoppers reined in spending in the months ahead of Christmas, with the December monthly figure showing there was no festive bounce to make up for lost ground,"" said Ed Monk, associate director for personal investing at Fidelity International. At the same time, Andrew Carlisle, managing director and UK retail consulting lead at Accenture, struck a more optimistic note. ""While these figures won't dispel concerns around the challenging UK retail climate, the picture is not all doom and gloom,"" he said. ""Consumer confidence rose to its highest since July last month, showing there could be better times ahead in 2020. Retailers will be hoping that an economic bounce and regulatory relief will see an upturn in fortunes."" But Capital Economics' UK economist Thomas Pugh said the figures added to worries about growth following this week's weak gross domestic product figures for November. ""December's outright fall in retail sales, despite a boost from the lateness of Black Friday, does not bode well for GDP growth in December and could nudge the MPC yet closer still to cutting rates at the end of the month,"" he said. A fall in inflation has also raised expectations a rate cut in on the cards. After the retail sales data was released, the pound reversed earlier gains and edged lower, another signal that the financial markets are expecting a rate cut.",Retail sales fell again in December as a Christmas shopping spree failed to materialise.
"By Michael CrossReporter Don't force people with long-term health problems like diabetes or chronic lung disease to trek in to hospital for routine tests and repeat prescriptions - monitor their conditions remotely instead. That's the promise of ""telehealth"", where patients monitor their own conditions through home, or even wearable, devices hooked up to the internet. In theory, telehealth can cut the cost of care while at the same time improving its quality (for example, by letting doctors know about crucial changes when they happen, not at the patient's next appointment). That's a powerful argument for governments and health maintenance organisations grappling with the soaring cost of long-term care throughout the developed world. In practice, however, proving telehealth's benefits is tricky. The UK's National Health Service (NHS), which is hoping to slash the cost of caring for an ageing population, has tried to settle the question by backing the world's largest trial of telecare. The Whole System Demonstrator trial followed the progress of 1,500 people with three long-term conditions in three different parts of England. Preliminary results were excellent - the first ""headline"" results published last year seemed to show that patients using telehealth were 20% less likely to be admitted to hospital and 45% less likely to die than their counterparts in the control group. Not surprisingly, the government embraced the new way of working. The Department of Health said telehealth was the answer to the ""confused, disjointed, fragmented mess"" of today's health and social care system and estimated that the widespread use of telehealth could save the NHS up to £1.2bn over five years. 'Unfounded' However, the latest detailed findings from the Whole System study paint a more complex picture. A study measuring the quality of life of people using telecare, reported in the British Medical Journal, finds that the technology had no measurable effect on feelings of well being. ""The findings suggest that claims for potentially salutary or deleterious effects of telehealth are unfounded for most patients. ""Telehealth should not be introduced with the aim of improving quality of life or psychological outcomes."" The researchers, led by Prof Stanton Newton of the School of Health Sciences, City University, London, noted that their conclusions ""differ markedly"" from those of most previous studies ""which are typically interpreted as showing benefits despite presenting equivocal evidence"". In other words, most studies of telehealth are designed by enthusiasts who are likely to draw positive conclusions even when the evidence may not be there to back it up. This suggests that past studies of telehealth, usually of small pilot projects, should perhaps be treated with scepticism. However this is not deterring the IT industry, which is ramping up a new generation of consumer devices to enable people to monitor their health - and relay data to their carers and relatives. The new buzzword is m-health, for devices that use mobile technology. Earlier this month, O2 - owned by Telefonica - launched Help at Hand, a device aimed at elderly people living in their own homes. The set-up comprises a special handset with a fall detector, GPS tracking, designated ""safe zones"" and a one-touch button that links to a 24/7 support centre that can contact loved ones, carers, or the emergency services if help is needed. O2 is also set to launch another initiative, called Health at Home, which is able to monitor a patient's vital signs. O2's rival Vodafone is also interested in m-health, where an internet-enabled device such as a smartphone will connect wirelessly to wearable, portable, or embeddable sensors to track or measure a patient's health or movements. However, a study it published earlier this year, ""Evaluating m-health adoption barriers: privacy and regulation"", suggests that the technology may have moved ahead of real-life medical practice. A big challenge is confidentiality - health data collected by people going about their daily lives is inherently less private than data collected in a one-to-one conversation with a clinician. Vodafone's report also points to regulatory challenges thrown up by m-health applications, which straddle the boundary between medical and telecommunications devices. Regulators cannot even agree on definitions - for example where a freely sold health and fitness app becomes a medical device, and subject to regulation. Unstoppable momentum Undeterred by these questions - and an unhappy track record computerising healthcare - the UK's NHS seems set on a technology-led future. Telehealth is a big part of the NHS in England's ""power of information"" strategy, which will also give patients access to their health records on the world wide web. Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, says that information and technology will help people manage their health independently and give people with long-term conditions control over their own care. His target is for three million people to benefit from telehealth by 2017. This makes England the leading centre for telehealth outside the US. Announcing the scheme last year, Mr Hunt said: ""People with long-term conditions see doctors and nurses more than most of us - £7 out of every £10 spent on the health budget go towards supporting them. ""I want to free people with long-term conditions from the constant merry-go-round of doctors' surgeries and hospitals. ""Technology can help people manage their condition at home, free up a lot of time and save the NHS money. ""In a world where technology increasingly helps us manage our social and professional lives, it seems logical that it should also help people manage their health."" With the government and the IT industry behind it, the momentum towards telehealth seems unstoppable - whatever the complexities of measuring its benefits. The good news - so far - from the Whole System trial is that telehealth does not seem to do any harm. But whether that finding can justify the claims made for telehealth is another matter.",It sounds like a no-brainer.
"Just over 59% of investors rejected Mr Dudley's 20% increase, one of the largest rejections to date of a corporate pay deal in the UK. The vote is non-binding on BP, but earlier, chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg promised to review future pay terms. Mr Dudley received the rise despite BP's falling profits and job cuts. Corporate governance adviser Manifest says the vote is at or above the fifth-largest in the UK against a boardroom remuneration deal. 'Last chance saloon' In his opening address to the shareholders' meeting, before the vote had been formally announced, Mr Svanberg acknowledged the strength of feeling, saying: ""Let me be clear. We hear you."" He continued: ""We will sit down with our largest shareholders to make sure we understand their concerns and return to seek your support for a renewed policy."" ""We know already from the proxies received and conversations with our institutional investors that there is real concern over the directors' pay in this challenging year for our shareholders. ""On remuneration, the shareholders' reactions are very strong. They are seeking change in the way we should approach this in the future,"" he said. The Institute of Directors said the shareholder rebellion would ""determine the future of corporate governance in the UK"". ""British boards are now in the last chance saloon, if the will of shareholders in cases like this is ignored, it will only be a matter of time before the government introduces tougher regulations on executive pay,"" said director general Simon Walker. 'Out of touch' Shareholders that criticised the pay deals included Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London Asset Management. Investor group Sharesoc branded the pay deal ""simply too high"", while Glass Lewis, ShareSoc, Pirc and Institutional Shareholder Services have also expressed their opposition. Earlier on Thursday, Ashley Hamilton Claxton, corporate governance manager at Royal London, told the BBC: ""The executives received the maximum bonuses possible in a year when [BP] made a record loss, and to us that just does not translate into very good decision-making by the board. ""We think it sends the wrong message. It shows that the board is out of touch."" She told the BBC's Today programme that if 20%-25% of shareholders vote down the pay deal, it would force BP to ""think long and hard about their decision"". The early voting figures suggest that the opposition is even bigger that she expected. Analysis: Simon Jack, BBC business editor Giving someone a 20% pay rise for a year's work that saw BP record its biggest ever operating loss seems perverse even by chief executive pay standards. If it's any consolation, (I doubt it will be), bosses at Exxon and Chevron got paid even more than Bob Dudley even though the value of their companies fell by more than BP. That's the bit that sticks in the craw for many. Under what circumstances don't these guys get paid a fortune? It would be fine if some years you win, some years you lose - but they never seem to lose. We may get a rebellion of 20-30% of shareholders today but even if it was more than 50%, the board doesn't have to listen. Shareholders do have a binding vote every three years on the pay policy and formula. No use crying now, the formula that spat out £14m for Bob Dudley was approved in 2014 by 96% of shareholders. Read Simon's full blog here. BP's pay policy is subject to a binding shareholder vote every three years. It was last set in 2014, meaning new proposals are due to be put forward for shareholder approval again in 2017. 'Surpassed expectations' Many experts argue that Mr Dudley is merely earning the market rate for international executives. Mark Freebairn, partner at recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson, told Today: ""If Bob Dudley was to leave [BP] it would be for a competitive company and remuneration would be part of the discussion. If you operate in a global market, you have to operate on a global scale."" BP was now in a far better position than when Mr Dudley took the helm, he said. After the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, BP's share price collapsed and it was forced to sell off assets worth billions of pounds to pay costs, fines and compensation. However, the collapse in the oil price over the past 18 months saw BP's profit tumble, and the company is axing another 3,000 jobs worldwide on top of the 4,000 cuts already announced. A spokesman for BP said before the meeting at London's ExCel centre had begun that shareholders had previously backed the pay formula. ""Despite the very challenging environment, BP's safety and operating performance was excellent throughout 2015... BP's performance surpassed the board's expectations on almost all of the measures that determine remuneration - and the outcome therefore reflects this. ""And these clear measures derive directly from BP's remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM with over 96% of the vote,"" the spokesman said. Mr Dudley's pay package was less than that earned by some rivals in the oil and gas industry, including at Exxon and Chevron. But it was more than the award for Ben van Beurden, chief executive at Royal Dutch Shell, whose salary package fell from €24.2m (£19m) in 2014 to €5.58m last year. Experts point out, though, that it can be difficult to compare like-with-like. For instance, Mr van Beurden's 2014 pay involved one-off pension payments and ""tax equalisation"" measures when he moved from the UK to the Netherlands. And in 2015 Mr Dudley and Mr van Beurden received very different rewards under their long-term incentive plans, LTIPs. Shell gave its chief executive 8% of the LTIP, down from 49% in 2014. Mr Dudley's long-term bonus increased from 63.8% of maximum to 77.6%.",BP shareholders have rejected a pay package of almost £14m for chief executive Bob Dudley at the oil company's annual general meeting.
"Brent crude hit its highest level since November 2014 at $81.16 a barrel, up 3% on the day. Saudi Arabia leads the Opec oil cartel, while Russia is the biggest oil producer outside the group. They met in Algiers on Sunday to discuss global supply levels and US sanctions on Iran. The meeting ended with no formal agreement on any additional supply boost. Saudi energy minister Khalid al-Falih said at a press conference in Algiers that he did not ""influence prices"". Opec and other producers had discussed raising output by 500,000 barrels a day, Reuters reported. Sales of Iranian crude have fallen as buyers remain wary of penalties from sanctions due to take effect from November. Those fears have sent crude oil prices higher, with commodity traders Trafigura and Mercuria predicting prices could rise to more than $100 a barrel by early next year. But Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president of energy consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, said the price rise was ""an overreaction in the market."" In a tweet last week, US president Donald Trump said that Opec ""must get prices down now!"" by raising global output. ""We protect the countries of the Middle East,"" added Mr Trump. ""They would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember."" Iranian oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Sunday that Mr Trump's tweet ""was the biggest insult to Washington's allies in the Middle East"". Last year, Opec and other oil-producing nations including Russia said they would extend a deal, first agreed in 2016, to cut production to help support oil prices after they fell below $50 a barrel. This deal was upheld at Sunday's meeting. ""We expect that those Opec countries with available spare capacity, led by Saudi Arabia, will increase output but not completely offset the drop in Iranian barrels,"" said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank. ""Were they do so the oil market would be even more uncomfortably tight than we forecast for 2019 as spare capacity is eroded,"" Mr Bell added. US light crude was $1.72 higher at $72.50 a barrel.",Oil prices have hit a four-year high of over $81 (£62) a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia rejected calls by Donald Trump to increase production.
"The app-based car-hire service joins rivals Grab and GoJek, who already have established similar services. Thousands of taxi drivers protested recently in the Indonesian capital against transport apps. The drivers said ride-hailing apps such as Uber have made it impossible for them to earn a living in the city. Uber started operating in Jakarta in the later part of 2014. The car-hire service also operates in other Indonesian cities - Bandung, Surabaya and the popular tourist destination Bali. It is calling its latest offering ""uberMOTOR"", which it claims will allow anyone in Jakarta to ""push a button and get a motorbike ride in minutes"". The company says its pricing is the ""most affordable"" in town, with a base fare starting at 1,000 Indonesian rupiah ($0.08; £0.06). Earlier this year, thousands of cab drivers in Paris also staged a protest, against competition from app-based taxi services including Uber. The Uber service is available in 380 cities around the world. The company has said it is profitable in the US. But in China, Uber is losing $1bn a year. And that is partly due to fierce competition.","Uber has launched a motorbike taxi service in Jakarta, to offer commuters an alternative for getting around the usually congested Indonesian capital."
"It featured a male model with a bald head and thick eyebrows, with the strapline ""Mo's mad for menthol"". Sir Mo had already complained on Twitter, saying ""You may have seen this ad and think it's me... I have not endorsed this product"". The advertising regulator said the advert gave the ""misleading impression"" the athlete had given his backing. ""His [the model's] bald head and eyebrow shape were reminiscent of Sir Mo's. ""The first name Mo was very common, but we considered that Sir Mo Farah was one of the most recognisable and well-known figures in the UK to go by that name,"" the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said in a statement. It said three people had complained, saying the man looked similar to athlete Sir Mo. The campaign for vaping firm Diamond Mist's liquid products was displayed on London buses in April and May. Diamond Mist argued that other adverts in the campaign used several other names, such as Claire, Lucy and Wang, and said that the skin tone of the model in the adverts was not similar to that of Sir Mo. It said the campaign was created to connect a range of personal names to the various e-liquid flavours it sold by using alliteration and a strong colour palette. But the ASA said the risk was consumers would see the advert in isolation ""and would not necessarily be aware of that context.""",A vaping advert has been banned for suggesting that Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah had endorsed the product.
"It said like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the three months to the end of September fell 2.8%, its third consecutive quarterly sales fall. Sainsbury's added it expected sales in the second half of the year would be ""similar to the first half"". Chief executive Mike Coupe blamed supermarket price wars for ""deflation in many areas of our business"". Sainsbury's has already lowered prices on essential food items in an effort to compete with rivals including Asda as well as discounters Lidl and Aldi. Challenges and opportunities Mr Coupe, presenting his first set of figures in charge of the supermarket since taking over from Justin King in July, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Clearly in the last few months the pace of change in our industry [has meant it] has changed beyond all recognition. ""Customers are shopping very differently to the way they were shopping even a year ago. So we are seeing an increase in the number of outlets available to them and they are shopping much more frequently and little and often shopping so these trends are changing very rapidly."" He added: ""Clearly there are challenges in the marketplace you can't deny that but there are equally fantastic opportunities for us."" John Ibbotson, director of the retail consultancy Retail Vision, said it was increasingly clear that Mr Coupe had taken ""the hospital pass just like Philip Clarke"". Price pressure ""With everyone reducing prices and food inflation low, Sainsbury's has got its work cut out. Cash-strapped consumers are reigning in on discretionary spending and increasingly deserting the big boys for the low cost discounters, or treating themselves to a premium upmarket experience in Waitrose. ""Who needs Sainsbury's, or Waitrose even, when you can get £9.99 Beluga Caviar at Aldi?"" Mr Ibbotson added: ""Expect this situation to go on for years, with the low cost discounters the only winners. The only limit is how many stores they can open."" Sainsbury's said total sales, which include sales at stores open for less than a year, also fell in the quarter by 0.8%. The like-for-like sales figures were slightly better than expected, with City analysts having forecast a fall in like-for-like sales of between 3.5% and 4%. But Sainsbury's said the accelerated pace of change in the grocery market, and continuing pressures on prices as a result of competition, meant food prices were likely to continue falling. It also gave a downbeat outlook of future sales, saying that like-for-like sales in the second half of the year - which includes the key Christmas trading period - would be ""similar"" to the first half. Sainsbury's like-for-like sales in the first half of the year, excluding petrol, fell 2.1%. Asked by the BBC whether about accounting standards at Sainsbury's following the news that Tesco had overstated its half year profit outlook in August, Mr Coupe, who was group commercial director before becoming chief executive said he was ""100% confident about the integrity of the accounts"". The latest industry figures from retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel showed Sainsbury's market share slipped from 16.6% to 16.2%, with growth across the entire grocer sector down to a record low of 0.3%. Asda is the only one of the so-called ""Big Four"" supermarkets - Asda, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - to have held onto its market share in the past year. On Monday, discount grocer Aldi reported a 36% surge in sales for 2013 and a 65% rise in pre-tax profits to £260.9m. Poster 'mistake' Sainsbury's sales figures come a day after the embarrassing revelation that a poster encouraging staff to get customers to spend more was put up in a store window in error. The sign, urging staff to get people to spend an extra 50p, appeared in Stratford, east London on Monday. Mr Coupe admitted to the Today programme it was ""clearly a mistake"" that the poster was put in the store window. But he added: ""It wouldn't be surprising that we encourage our staff to sell to our customers. If we do a great job for our customers they will spend more.""",Sainsbury's shares have closed down 7% after it reported a fall in sales for the past quarter.
"By Andrew WalkerEconomics correspondent, BBC World Service IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn told the BBC last month that there were signs that countries were trying to use their currencies ""as a weapon"". For his part, Brazil's Guido Mantega said competitive devaluations by advanced countries amounted to a new trade war. ""We're in the midst of an international currency war,"" he told a meeting of industrial leaders in September. ""This threatens us because it takes away our competitiveness."" But what does it all mean? There are several main elements, two of them fairly new, but the first is a long-standing one. China versus the US It is China's policy of managing its currency and limiting its movement against the US dollar. It has been through several phases and during the financial crisis, China went back to keeping the yuan from rising. Since just before the Toronto G20 summit in June, it has eased the controls and allowed the currency to move up against the dollar, but by less than 2.5% (as of now). And because the dollar has fallen, the yuan has dropped against many other currencies as well. Why the Chinese reluctance to allow the yuan to rise much? A fear of job losses among export industries that would be made less competitive. The rise against the dollar has not been enough to satisfy the US, where there is a long standing complaint that China manipulates its currency to gain an unfair advantage. The cry is: ""It costs American jobs."" US economic policy Many in the US complain about China, but are their hands entirely clean? Some in the rest of the world say not. The dollar has fallen sharply in recent months, because interest rates are low, so investors have been seeking higher returns in emerging economies. They need to buy the currency of the country concerned to make those investments. That tends to push its value up, while the dollar, which they are selling, tends to fall. And the effect is aggravated by the Federal Reserve's other policy, known as quantitative easing. The Fed buys financial assets and the money it pays with has to be invested somewhere. The weak dollar has an advantage for the US - it's that competitiveness issue again. It should help American exporters. The US has a large trade deficit, so more exports could help fix that. Some even argue that the Fed's policies are actually intended to weaken the dollar and help the US economy recover by exporting more. Emerging economies The Fed's policies have led to a wave of money-seeking opportunities in the emerging economies. That tends to push their currencies up, undermining their competitiveness. There is also the risk of bubbles in financial and property markets. And capital inflows can go into reverse - as they did in the Asian crisis in the 1990s. So the third element in the currency ""war"" is the resistance of emerging economies, and some developed ones too. Brazil and Thailand have used tax measures to slow the inflows. Japan, South Korea and others have intervened in the currency markets, buying foreign currency in an attempt to interrupt the rise of their own. There is a view that they will just have to live with it. The upward pressure on the currencies of many emerging economies reflects the fact they are more growing strongly than the US. It is difficult for them to manage, but the underlying reason is that they are doing relatively well. Economic imbalances The currency war is closely linked with another theme that has been troubling many economists for several years, that of global economic imbalances. In international terms, it is trade that is unbalanced. Actually, the thing that is most often the focus is the ""current account balance"", which means trade in goods and services plus some financial items, including remittances that migrant workers send home. Usually, though, trade is responsible for most of the current account imbalance. Some countries have large trade surpluses, notably China, Germany, Saudi Arabia and Russia. The big deficit country is the United States. Some countries at the eye of the European storm have hefty deficits too - Greece, Portugal and Spain. Britain also has a deficit, although as a share of national income, it is not all that large. The other side of international imbalances is high savings at home with a surplus country such as China, and relatively low savings in a deficit country such as the US. Household savings have risen in the US, the UK and other deficit countries, because consumers are borrowing less in the wake of the financial crisis. But international imbalances also reflect how much governments borrow and in many deficit countries that has risen, partly offsetting the increase in private savings. Why does all this matter? Those countries where saving has risen desperately want to export more. They want to sell more abroad to make up for consumers at home drawing in their horns. That is true of the US, Britain and many others. They could do that more easily if consumers in China and the other surplus countries were willing to buy more imported goods. A rise in China's currency would not be a cure-all, but it would probably help.","It has been called a ""currency war"", by the International Monetary Fund's managing director and the Brazilian finance minister among others."
"The potential move would mean people arriving in the UK from the islands would not have to self-isolate for 14 days after rules changed this weekend. The travel industry is hoping ministers make a decision by Friday. A government source said there are no plans to change the rules, while No 10 said ""no travel is risk free"". One travel industry source said the government had told them it wanted to study more data from Spain's islands before making a decision. The rate of infection in Spain is 35.1 cases per 100,000 people, while the UK is at 14.7, according to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Data up to 19 July suggested there were lower rates of infection in the Balearic and Canary Islands than in mainland Spain. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said he cancelled a holiday to the Balearics after the change in quarantine rules was announced on Saturday. Labour's shadow health minister Justin Madders said the change ""couldn't have been done at a worse time or handled in a worse way"" and questioned whether the quarantine rule should extend to the whole of Spain. Among the thousands of British holidaymakers affected was Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who flew to Spain on Saturday despite knowing a decision on the policy was due. Mr Shapps said in a statement he would return to the UK this week in order to complete his quarantine and would return to work as soon as possible. James Middleton, a receptionist from Weston-super-Mare, is also due to return home from his holiday this week. His employer is looking at what it can do to help but the 49-year-old, who is holidaying in Tenerife until Tuesday, said he now risks going without pay in order to observe the quarantine rule. ""I will have credit card bills to pay at the end of the month and with no income for two weeks, I will not be able to pay them and will invite interest on them,"" Mr Middleton said. He said he has ""no problem"" with the quarantine rule as the government ""has to act on the information"" it has - but he thinks it should ""support"" those who are affected. ""They have said before no one should suffer as a result of following these rules so they should stand by it. The minimum support on offer should be sick leave pay,"" he said. Concern has grown among employers about what to do if their staff cannot immediately return to work after holidaying in Spain. Debbie Pearson runs small catering businesses in the West Midlands. Staff at her business that caters for weddings and events are furloughed, but staff at two firms that supply meals for the elderly are still working. Ms Pearson said she will not be able to claim statutory sick pay for workers who must isolate for two weeks upon returning for holiday for either of those businesses. ""If I have to pay to pay them, I would pay them,"" she said. Because one of her businesses only has three staff, it will also pile pressure on the remaining two staff if they have to cover the extra work for two more weeks. ""We pride ourselves on being a good employer,"" she said. ""If somebody had been abroad and told to isolate, I'd want to make sure they weren't asked to work."" Cancellations Holiday companies have responded to the imposition of the quarantine for people arriving from Spain. EasyJet said it would operate its full schedule of flights to Spain, but it is cancelling holidays to all Spanish destinations for the next few weeks. It said it only offered holidays where there was no known requirement to self-isolate on arrival or return. Ryanair said its schedules ""remain in place"" and it will continue flights in and out of Spain as normal. Jet2 cancelled flights and holidays from Costa de Almeria, Alicante, Malaga and Murcia up to 16 August. Package holiday firm Tui cancelled all mainland Spanish holidays until 9 August. It said customers due to travel to all areas of Spain between 27 July and 9 August would be able to cancel or amend holidays and receive a full refund or the option to rebook their holiday with an incentive. However, there will be uncertainty for those with holidays due to depart from 10 August as the company said it will be update passengers with future bookings on 31 July. The UK Foreign Office currently advises against ""all but essential travel"" to countries without air bridge agreements in place. Blanket measures Tui has urged the UK government not to slap blanket quarantines on whole countries. Andrew Flintham, managing director of TUI UK and Ireland, said the government should have a ""regionalised"" policy. That would mean only travellers returning from coronavirus hotspots should be forced to quarantine. The UK imposed the restriction over the weekend after a spike in infections in some Spanish regions, including Catalonia, where Barcelona is located, and Aragon. The French government has been telling its nationals to stay away from Catalonia, while Norway has imposed a new 10-day quarantine on all travellers arriving from Spain. Mr Flintham told the BBC that the government was ""rightly nervous"" about people's ability to move ""relatively unchecked"" around countries which had a spike of cases in certain areas. However, he said most holidaymakers stayed in one place when they got there and should be safe if they were not in high-risk areas. ""They do not go travelling around wider Spain and then they come home again,"" he said. A further seven people with coronavirus have died across all settings in the UK, according to latest government figures - bringing the UK's death toll to 45,759. The government also said in the 24-hour period up to 09:00 BST on Monday, there had been a further 685 lab-confirmed cases. The UK's total is 300,111.","Talks are under way with Spain about easing quarantine rules for the Balearic and Canary Islands, a government source has said."
"It follows a strategic review of its UK operations. NAB said the decision was taken after a ""significant downgrade in the growth prospects of the UK economy"". The banks will pull out of commercial property lending and narrow their focus to consumer and small business lending in Scotland and the north of England. Advice centres shut NAB said its UK operations had made a loss of £25m in the second half of the financial year, compared with a £77m profit the same time a year earlier. It blamed the fall on deteriorating commercial property loans and an increase in the cost of funding after Clydesdale's credit rating was downgraded last September. The bank made a charge in its accounts of £282m for bad loans, mainly in the commercial property market. ""UK Banking's risk appetite will be modified and will no longer accommodate financing of property development or property investment, where the underlying purpose is to generate rental income and capital gains,"" the bank said. The ""vast majority"" of the banks' commercial property portfolios, valued at about £6.2bn, will be transferred to NAB. It said it would close 29 of the banks' 73 Financial Solution Centres, which offer services to businesses and better-off individual investors, and merge nine others with local retail branches, adding that the changes would mainly affect operations in the south of England. Six back office locations would also shut, it added in its statement. The bank said it expected the closures and restructuring would cost about £195m, but would save about £74m a year by 2015. Following the cuts, the workforce of NAB's UK operations would stand at 6,900, down from 8,300. The restructuring needs to be approved by both the Australian and UK financial regulators before it can go ahead. ""[The banks'] are having to retrench and go back to their core activities and core geographies... offering building society services to local people,"" Chris Roebuck from the Cass Business School told the BBC. ""Areas that were viable before the financial crisis are no longer viable."" 'Not credible' The Unite union described the job losses as ""brutal"". ""Unite finds it disgusting that the company decided to release a statement from Australia in the middle of the night so UK staff across Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks would wake up to hear that their jobs are being cut through the morning news reports,"" said the union's national officer David Fleming. ""This is not the behaviour of a responsible or credible organisation."" NAB bought Clydesdale Bank in 1987, followed by Yorkshire Bank in 1990. The banks' operations were merged by NAB in 2001, although the two names have been retained. Yorkshire Bank was founded in 1859 in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and has 185 retail branches, while Glasgow-based Clydesdale has 152 outlets.","The Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks will cut 1,400 jobs by 2015, their owner National Australia Bank (NAB) has announced."
"The TV commercial showed a mother preparing a burger for her daughter while they talk about school. The girl then removes the salad, onion and tomato from the burger and leaves them on the side of her plate. The Advertising Standards Authority ruled that this ""suggested she was not going to eat the salad later"". Eleven people complained about the advert, which was found to have broken two rules in the UK code of broadcast advertising. The ASA said: ""Because we considered the ad placed an emphasis on the burger being the preferable option to the salad, we concluded it condoned poor nutritional habits or an unhealthy lifestyle, especially in children, and that it disparaged good dietary practice."" Morrisons was represented at the hearing by industry body Clearcast, which approved the advertisement before it went on air. It argued that ""the daughter did not look disdainfully at the salad items or make a face that implied she did not like them or would not eat them in the future"" and that ""it was perfectly feasible that she would return to it later"". This is the first time in two years that an advert has been found to breach healthy eating guidelines. In 2012, sweet company Swizzels Matlow was forced to remove an online game, following an ASA ruling that it would encourage poor nutritional habits. Morrisons said it was disappointed with the adjudication","Supermarket giant Morrisons cannot rebroadcast an advert for burgers after a watchdog ruled that it ""condoned poor nutritional habits""."
"The troubled bank was forced to hand over control to private investors after discovering a serious capital shortfall in its balance sheet. The plan will give bondholders 70% ownership of the bank while the Co-op Group, the bank's current owner, will see its stake fall to 30%. The Co-op said 99.9% of creditors who voted had approved the plan. The deal still needs to be approved by a court on Wednesday. Labour's former City minister Lord Myners has been appointed as Co-op Group's senior independent director and will chair its governance review. In addition to the bank's financial problems, it was hit by scandal when former chairman Paul Flowers was arrested for alleged drugs offences.

"By Howard MustoeMoney Box reporter The Law Commission this week outlined a variety of potential reforms to the system, but stopped short of suggesting leaseholds be scrapped. Holders of shorter leases were watching out for any potential changes to so-called marriage value. Leaseholders must pay this when extending leases of 80 years or less. For many former council tenants who bought their homes in the 1980s, that 80-year point may be close, BBC research suggests. Campaigners want radical action now. Marriage value is ""absurd"", said Dean Buckner, a former Bank of England regulator and trustee of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, which campaigns for reform. Value difference? When a homebuyer purchases a leasehold property, they do not possess it outright. Instead they gain the right to occupy it for a set number of years. They can extend their lease, usually by 90 years, by applying to their freeholder and negotiating a fee. The government's advisory service for leaseholders describes marriage value as the increase in the value of the property once the lease has been extended. Some of that increase is down to a lease being 90 years longer and the fact that this makes the property more attractive to potential buyers. But any extra gain on top of that for the longer lease, or ""profit"" as the leasehold advisory service calls it, is then shared between the freeholder and leaseholder, and the leaseholder has to hand over the freeholder's half. Beyond 80 years, according to the law, the value is zero. It is one of three payments a leaseholder with fewer than 80 years to go must make. The other two are a payment to cover ground rents and a payment for the extra 90 years itself. ""The idea that the value of something that I sell you can be different after I sell it is absurd,"" said Dr Buckner. ""There can't be a difference in value"" BBC research suggests that a large number of council flats, sold as leasehold under the Right to Buy scheme, could be approaching 80 years. Right to Buy allows council tenants to buy their homes, and some flats were sold as leasehold rather than freehold, especially in big cities. A 125-year leasehold flat sold in 1980 at the very start of the Right to Buy scheme will have 85 years remaining. Already, councils have extended more than 2,500 leases, raising more than £27m, according to Freedom of Information responses from 251 English and Welsh authorities. One leaseholder in London's Lambeth district paid the council £570,000 for an extension, while a lease in Camden with 38 years left raised £209,000 for its council, and a 45-year lease in the City of London attracted a £182,000 payment. Large parts of these payments - and for shorter leases, the majority - are for marriage value. The Law Commission in this week's report came up with three options for the government to consider. Abolish marriage value, pay a reduced fee called hope value, or leave things more or less the same. The report itself offers no preference on these. Des Kinsella, who is facing a request for £42,000 to extend his lease, was hoping for a forthright proposal from the commission, rather than a series of very different options. ""I thought it was going to be making things fairer and cheaper for leaseholders,"" he said ""I'm not sure."" There are reasons for leaseholders to feel optimistic, however, said Katie Cohen, a partner at Keystone Law, where her work includes leasehold extensions and freehold purchases. Long process ""The starting point is very much reducing premiums,"" she says. ""The extent to which the reductions will be made is entirely up to the government."" This may be a long process, however, she warned. Part of the problem is the lack of a scenario where both parties win. ""The interest of the leaseholder and freeholder are diametrically opposed,"" she says. ""The Freeholder wants the leaseholder to pay as much as possible, being blunt, and the leaseholder wants to pay as little as possible."" Because of no set timeframe and the need for government to decide on what to do, leaseholders who have been waiting to renew and are close to the 80-year mark where marriage payments may be due may want to consider extending soon, she said. Radical hopes ""We were hoping this would be more radical,"" says Louie Burns, managing director of Leasehold Solutions Group and a campaigner on behalf of leaseholders. ""Marriage value particularly is artificial. There's no reason for it to exist."" He hopes the government will at least make calculating the payments easier, because currently they are based on rival valuations and negotiation. ""We have a real chance here to make this system fairer,"" he says. You can hear more on BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme on Saturday at 12pm or listen again here.","The system of pricing extensions for leasehold homes has been branded ""absurd"" by a campaigner."
"Citing the ongoing trade war between the US and China, Mr Ma told China's Xinhua news agency: ""There is no way to complete the promise."" It follows remarks by Mr Ma at Alibaba's investor day that the trade tensions could continue for decades. He had previously embraced the idea of expanding in the US. In January 2017, Mr Ma met with US President Donald Trump, outlining a plan to increase Alibaba's presence in America and strengthen relations between the two countries. Alibaba said access to Chinese customers through its online marketplace would help US businesses grow and hire workers - as many as one million people over five years. However, on Thursday Mr Ma said the pledge had been based on the idea of strong US-China relations, which have now turned sour. ""The current situation has already destroyed the original premise,"" he said. ""There is no way to complete the promise, but we will not stop our efforts and will work hard to promote the healthy development of Sino-US trade."" He added: ""The trade in the world really needs to be perfected, but trade is not a weapon, it cannot be used for war, it should be a propeller for peace."" 'Great things' Alibaba's jobs pledge followed investments by the firm in US companies such as Snapchat and Jet.com, as well as efforts to launch a US online shopping site. After their 2017 meeting, Mr Trump appeared positive, telling reporters, ""Jack and I are going to do some great things."" Weeks later, Alibaba's digital payments affiliate, Ant Financial Services Group, announced plans to acquire the US money transfer firm Moneygram. But the deal never moved forward as relations between the US and China deteriorated. In August 2017, Mr Trump ordered an investigation of Chinese trade practices, accusing the country of unfair treatment of US companies. And in January, his administration blocked Ant Financial's Moneygram deal on national security grounds. The US has since announced tariffs of up to 25% on Chinese imports worth an estimated $250bn in trade in 2017. The newest round will go into effect next week. China has retaliated by raising its own tariffs on US-made products. Analysts have also warned that US companies selling in China could face nationalist backlash against their products.","Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who once boasted his e-commerce firm would spur the creation of one million jobs in America, has rowed back on those plans."
"Disney said it had appointed Bob Chapek, who previously ran the company's parks and products division, to replace him. Mr Iger will remain Disney's executive chairman until the end of next year to direct ""creative endeavours"". The move came as a surprise. Mr Iger, who is considered by many to be the most powerful man in Hollywood, had served as chief executive since 2005. He has previously announced plans to retire only to push back his departure date. 'Optimal time' In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Iger said it was the ""optimal time"" to begin to hand control of the company to a new leader. Disney recently completed the acquisition of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox entertainment empire and launched the Disney+ streaming channel late last year. Earlier, Mr Iger presided over the firm's acquisition of Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. ""The company has gotten larger and more complex just in the recent 12 months,"" Mr Iger said on a conference call on Tuesday. ""I felt that with the asset bases in place and with our strategy deployed I should be spending as much time as possible on the creative side of our business."" Remaining as executive chairman would ease the transition, he added. Mr Chapek, who joined Disney in 1993, will be the firm's seventh chief executive since it was formed in the 1920s. In his prior role, among other achievements, he oversaw the opening of Disney's park in Shanghai. ""His tremendous understanding of the breadth and depth of the Company and appreciation for the special connection between Disney and its consumers makes him the perfect choice,"" said Disney board member Susan Arnold. Shares in the firm fell 2% in after-hours trading after the news was announced. Mr Iger, who recently published a memoir, is much beloved by investors for his record steering the company to steady profits, despite upheaval in the television and movie industries. Disney claimed seven of the top 10 box office hits globally last year and the new streaming channel has already attracted more than 28 million paying customers. The firm's market value has increased five-fold during his tenure, Ms Arnold said. The firm is now worth about $230bn.","Disney boss Bob Iger, who led the media company through several blockbuster acquisitions and the launch of a streaming network, is stepping down as chief executive."
"The warning, in a trading update to investors, is the third in six months from the Yorkshire-based firm. Bonmarché, which has 312 outlets specialising in clothing for the over-50s, said sales post-Christmas had actually picked up slightly. But it said trading since the start of this month ""significantly"" weakened. The statement comes less than two weeks before the company's annual results at the end of March. Bonmarché had had a lot of stock left over from a poor third quarter, which it sold off with deep discounts. It said this strategy worked well. Autumn and winter season stock levels were now 40% lower than at this time last year. It struck another mildly positive note, saying sales since Christmas had been slightly above the level required to meet the revised forecast range of losses of up to £4m that it indicated in December, and it was confident it would meet that target. But since then, trading in March had reversed those gains and ""in light of this, we now believe there is a likelihood of sales levels for the remainder of the month continuing to follow this trend"". It went on to say the underlying loss for the year to the end of March 2019 would be greater than £4m, and ""accordingly, we now estimate that the underlying PBT [profit before tax] loss will be between £5m and £6m"". Next year, it expects to meet its forecasts.","Shares in clothing chain Bonmarché are down 14% after it warned losses could reach £5-6m this year, far worse than the £4m loss previously predicted."
"By Mukul DevichandMumbai, India For the past three years, the Mohan family, like millions of others across Asia, has been hoarding gold with any cash its members can spare. ""We purchase one coin or two coins a month,"" says retired Indian Navy officer Alok Mohan. It's an investment decision based on traditional culture. The couple's daughter is approaching ""marriageable age,"" they say, and they'll need to give jewellery as gifts. Like millions of Indians, Mr Mohan feels that ancient financial wisdom has been vindicated by the recent surge in gold prices. Gold has edged above $1,500 an ounce and has continued to rise in value despite the global economic slowdown - up five-fold in a decade. India is already the world's biggest gold market for cultural reasons, with prices around the world affected by seasonal demand around the Diwali festival and the wedding season. The growing middle class in China is catching up fast. Mainland China's Communist-led government deregulated gold ownership over a decade ago, and demand for jewellery has doubled in the past seven years, according to the World Gold Council. The Mohan family believe their gold coins, and the jewellery they will eventually get made, are a better investment than anything else out there. With the global economy sluggish, returns on gold can be better than shares or equity. Precious metal But if Asian families believe they're making an investment rather than just buying pretty necklaces or rings, they are deluding themselves, say experts. ""Jewellery is a very bad investment,"" says Harsh Roongta of the price comparison website ApnaPaisa.com, based in Mumbai. Prices of necklaces, bracelets and rings reflect the cost of making them - which can add up to 30% on the price of the actual gold in these items. If you want to benefit from the price of gold, he recommends various investment products and funds that are linked to gold instead. Several index funds and exchange-traded funds based on gold are now available to consumers in India and beyond (although these funds are not without their critics either). These funds are managed by companies that invest in gold bullion or firms that are mining for gold, and pay out the returns. This allows customers to benefit from rising gold prices, because the value of the funds goes up. The gold bubble? However, in reality the price of gold is going up because Asian governments are hoarding the shiny metal, not the investments of ordinary people. ""It's actually the governments in the big emerging markets who historically have surpluses in the US dollar,"" explains Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services - a UK investment broker. ""They are looking to diversify."" This means the rise in gold prices may continue. But George Soros, the billionaire investor who recently put money into gold, offered a sober warning in an interview with Reuters last year. ""I've called gold the ultimate bubble,"" said Mr Soros. ""It may be going higher, but it's certainly not safe and it's not going to last forever."" That means that even if you buy gold or invest in gold-linked funds, it shouldn't be the only place you save your money. ""As an investor, we want to be careful that we don't have all our money in one asset class,"" says Mr McDermott. Investments you can wear Of course, investing in gold-linked funds or putting your money into other stocks means saying goodbye to beautiful jewellery you can wear. Sulbha Jagtap, a 40-year old office worker, looks at her husband ruefully as she explains why the couple no longer invest their savings in gold jewellery. ""He feels that gold does not have the resale value,"" she says. Her husband Nitin explains that apart from a smaller number of items for Sulbha to wear to weddings, the household savings have gone into more profitable investments like mutual funds and fixed deposit schemes. ""I agree that there are some emotions that come in when we purchase gold,"" Ms Jagtap, with a tinge of regret. The opinions expressed are those of the contributors and not held by the BBC.

"By Daniel ThomasBusiness reporter, BBC News ""I have a heart condition, so being at high altitudes it is fine for a few days but we don't know long how we'll be here for."" Mr Ffrancis and his wife Meinir are among 400 UK tourists currently stranded in Peru after it closed its borders on Sunday to contain the coronavirus and flights were suspended. Some who spoke to the BBC said they faced serious health problems, others that they were running out of cash. Many also feel UK government is not doing enough to get them home at a time when other nations are funding the high costs of repatriations. The Ffrancises were on a trip of a lifetime across South America when they arrived in Cusco, in the Peruvian Andes, on Saturday, only to learn that the government had declared a national emergency, with the borders locked down for 15 days or longer. ""No one can get in or out of the country, there are police-enforced curfews, public transport has been shut down,"" Mr Ffrancis told the BBC. ""We have enough money to stay here if this goes on longer than 15 days, which it will, but there are young people in youth hostels in a far more precarious situations,"" he said. ""It seems the UK government has made no contingency plans - there has been a lack of international co-operation."" Tourists 'must pay for airline tickets' Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said he is asking the Peruvian authorities to lift restrictions so rescue flights could start bringing people home. But the government says tourists must pay for their own airline tickets home once a flight becomes available. So far, the only commercial carrier to have offered to help is charging $3,000-$3,500 (£2,570-£3,000) for a one-way ticket - almost 10 times the normal price. The stranded Brits say many cannot afford to pay those prices, and that the government has effectively ""washed its hands"" of its responsibility. They also note that both Germany and Israel are paying to repatriate citizens stranded because of the coronavirus outbreak, while other countries like Norway and France are working on rescue plans. Danielle Cook, 32, and her partner Matthew Houghton, 34, from Yorkshire are also stuck in Peru, and to make matters worse her father passed away a few days ago. ""My family has not been able to make any funeral arrangements and I feel so guilty being here,"" she says. The couple and nine others, including Dutch and Canadian travellers, had gone to Peru to see the mountain Machu Picchu, but they are all now holed up at an Airbnb in Cusco. ""We were all angry about the [offer of the] $3,000 flights because it felt we were being exploited,"" she says. ""But we are also worried about how we pay for our Airbnb if this goes on for a long time. ""I appreciate the virus has created a crazy situation in the UK, but the government has not stepped up."" David Lillywhite, who along with wife Leah is stuck in Peru, has an immune deficiency disorder and is worried he will run out of medicine if he doesn't get home soon. ""I rely on a weekly infusion, and without it I will be very much at risk,"" he told the BBC. ""The British Consulate advised us to get in touch with a medical centre here, but they do not have the medication in Cusco."" He says there has been a general lack of communication from the UK government, which has shut down its embassy in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps spoke to airlines and airports on Wednesday and said the government expects to announce a series of support measures shortly. He also urged any British passengers overseas planning to return to the UK soon to ""take account of the fast-moving situation and plan accordingly while flights remain available"". Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: ""We are working round the clock to bring home passengers stranded overseas, and will continue with these efforts. ""We do urge passengers to check their airline's website and where there are options to come home take them as soon as they can.""","""We can't go anywhere, we are stuck in our hotel - we are only allowed to go out to get food, money or medication,"" says 70-year-old Ffred Ffrancis from Wales."
"Ho Ching joined Temasek in 2002 as executive director, and was appointed chief executive two years later. Temasek is ranked among the world's biggest investors although the fund's value has dropped during the pandemic. Ms Ho, the wife of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, will be succeeded by Cambridge-educated lawyer Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara. Temasek has stepped up investing abroad under Ms Ho, and in September said that its holdings in China surpassed its home market of Singapore for the first time. It has made big gains from investing in China's e-commerce giant Alibaba, founded by Jack Ma. Other key holdings include Singapore's DBS banking group, China Construction Bank and Standard Chartered. Last fiscal year, Temasek posted its worst results since 2016 as economies slowed due to the virus pandemic. Its net portfolio value fell to $230bn in the year ended March, from $235bn a year earlier. Ms Ho started her career as an engineer and was the president and chief executive of Singapore Technologies Group prior to joining Temasek. Her successor Mr Pillay joined Temasek in 2010 and has held various leadership roles including overseeing the fund's US and Americas market teams. In 2019 he was appointed chief executive of Temasek International, the wholly-owned management and investment arm of Temasek Holdings.

"By Katie HopeBusiness reporter, BBC News While this may be where the garment was finally sewn together, it has already been to several other countries. In fact, it's quite possible this piece of clothing is better travelled than you. If it was human, it would have certainly journeyed far enough to have earned itself some decent air miles. The material used to create it came from lyocell - a sustainable alternative to cotton. The trees used to make this fibre come mainly from Europe, according to Lenzing, the Austrian supplier that Zara-owner Inditex uses. These fibres were shipped to Egypt, where they were spun into yarn. This yarn was then sent to China where it was woven into a fabric. This fabric was then sent to Spain where it was dyed, in this case pink. The fabric was then shipped to Morocco to be cut into the various parts of the dress and then sewn together. After this, it was sent back to Spain where it was packaged and then sent to the UK, the US or any one of the 93 countries where Inditex has shops. From dresses to t-shirts and trousers, most items of clothing sold around the world will have had similarly complicated journeys. In fact, they're likely to be even more convoluted. Most Inditex garments are made close to its Spanish headquarters or in nearby countries such as Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. This is what helps the firm achieve its famously fast reaction times to new trends. Most of its rivals' supply chains are far less local. Regardless of where they're based, most factories are not owned by the fashion brands that use them. Instead, they're selected as official suppliers. Often these suppliers subcontract work to other factories for certain tasks, or in order to meet tight deadlines. This system can make tracking the specific origins of a single item difficult. I contacted several big clothing brands including H&M, Marks and Spencer, Gap and Arcadia Group last week to give me a sample example of the journey of a t-shirt in their basic range from seed to finished product. Only Inditex was able to respond in time to meet the deadline for this article. ""I imagine companies don't want to respond because they have no clue where the materials they buy come from,"" says Tim Hunt, a researcher at Ethical Consumer, which researches the social, ethical and environmental behaviour of firms. The difficulties were highlighted devastatingly by the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster where more than 1,100 people were killed and 2,500 injured when the Bangladesh garment factory collapsed. In some cases, brands weren't even aware their clothes were being produced there. According to the ""Behind the Barcode"" report by Christian Aid and development organisation Baptist World Aid Australia, only 16% of the 87 biggest fashion brands publish a full list of the factories where their clothes are sewn, and less than a fifth of brands know where all of their zips, buttons, thread and fabric come from. Non-profit group Fashion Revolution, formed after the Rana Plaza factory collapse, is leading a campaign to try to force firms to be more transparent about their supply chains. Every year, around the time of the disaster it runs a #whomademyclothes campaign encouraging customers to push firms on this issue. Fashion Revolution co-founder and creative director Orsola de Castro says the mass production demands of the fashion industry and the tight timescales required to get products from the catwalks on to the shelves as quickly as possible means the manufacturing processes have become ""very, very chaotic"". ""The amount of manpower which goes into the production of a t-shirt - even at the sewing level, it goes through so many different hands. On their standard products most brands wouldn't know the journey from seed to store,"" she says. While newer and smaller fashion brands are creating products with 100% traceability, she says it's a lot harder for the established giants. ""It's a big and complex issue to turn around and would require a massive shift in attitude."" Yet just over a decade ago, Pietra Rivoli had no problems tracking the journey of a single $6 cotton t-shirt she'd picked out of a sale bin in a Walmart in Florida. Starting with the tag at the back of the t-shirt, she tracked its journey backwards from the US ""step by step along the supply chain"". ""A shoe leather project,"" is how Prof Rivoli describes her journey, which resulted in a book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy. As a teacher of finance and international business at Georgetown University in Washington, Prof Rivoli wanted to investigate her assumption that free trade benefited all countries. Her travels took her from the cotton-growing region of Lubbock in Texas to China, where the t-shirt was sewn together. Eventually, she ended up in Tanzania on the east coast of Africa, which has a thriving second-hand clothing market. Her assumption was that the complicated supply chain was driven by cost and market forces. She concluded that a lot of brands' decisions about where to buy supplies and make their clothing was actually driven by politics. She cites US agricultural subsidies for cotton growers and China's migration policies encouraging workers to move from the countryside as examples. ""Rather than a story of how people were competing - how do I make a faster T-shirt, a better T-shirt, a cheaper T-shirt - what I found is that the story of the T-shirt and why its life turned out the way it did was really about how people were using political power,"" she says. The current backlash against global trade is a direct result of this kind of political interference, she believes. This kind of consumer anger could eventually drive change among fashion firms, she says. Prof Rivoli notes that many firms now list all their direct suppliers and she says there is a move towards developing fewer, longer term supplier relationships. ""There might be a little less hopping around,"" she laughs.","""Made in Morocco"" says the label on the pink Zara shirt dress."
"The Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index slipped to 56.7 last month from August's 57.1, but was still above the 50-mark indicating expansion. Growth in output and new orders remained close to August's 19-year high. But export business growth was weak. ""UK manufacturing continues to boom. These numbers are encouraging in respect to the rebalancing of the economy, with goods production likely to provide a major stimulus to economic growth in the third quarter,"" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit. The only weak point in the survey was the slower rise in export orders, which Mr Dobson said was disappointing. ""We would expect to be seeing far stronger export gains than companies are currently reporting, especially with the eurozone showing signs of finally pulling out of recession,"" Mr Dobson said. Both employment and prices rose at their fastest pace in two years, suggesting the UK's economic recovery is gathering steam. Lee Hopley, chief economist at EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, said the figures marked another ""solid month"" for manufacturing. ""Output, orders and employment (are) all up, paving the way for a decent quarter of growth across the sector."" Manufacturing accounts for 10% of the UK economy. The sector grew 0.9% in the three months to June, helping the economy as a whole to grow 0.7%. Many economists are forecasting a faster pace of economic growth in the third quarter. ""Continued strength in the manufacturing sector will add to the belief that the UK's economy is becoming more 'broad-based', as we progress through the year,"" said Jeremy Cook, chief economist at currency broker World First.","UK manufacturing grew for the sixth consecutive month in September, a survey has indicated, and recorded its strongest quarterly performance for two and a half years."

"Last week, the Bank failed to find enough sellers when it offered to buy the bonds, known as gilts. But it found no shortage of sellers on Tuesday. The ""reverse auction"" was oversubscribed by almost 2.7 times. By creating money to buy gilts the Bank hopes to push cash out into the economy for investment and lending. Pension funds in particular have been reluctant to sell gilts, especially those with long maturities, because they bought them when they were cheap and offered a high rate of return. The Bank's quantitative easing programme began in 2009, and last month it announced a new £60bn round of government bond buying to try to stimulate growth after signs of a slowdown followed the referendum vote in June.

"Many reported that voice messaging and pictures wouldn't send without a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent China's censorship filters. The seemed to be working normally on Wednesday morning, but there have been more interruptions since then. The disruptions come as China clamps down on online platforms. What was the disruption? Users began noticing over the weekend that WhatsApp wouldn't send pictures, voice messages and video, although text messages continued to work normally. The disruptions continued through Tuesday evening. The Chinese government hasn't said if it's blocking WhatsApp. The messaging service hasn't commented either, nor has it told its users there's a technical fault. The BBC's Beijing bureau has been testing the app every few hours, and while all functions were working normally without a VPN on Wednesday morning, there have seemingly been more interruptions since then. In its most recent internet censorship report, the free speech advocacy group Freedom House said WhatsApp was blocked in 12 countries, which is more than any other messaging app. Why would China block WhatsApp? China is increasing its censorship of online commentary it perceives as politically sensitive, and it's using increasingly sophisticated methods to achieve that goal. The government is expected to tighten restrictions ahead of the next communist party congress, where President Xi Jinping is tipped to cement his leadership position. Recently, it blocked social media posts and even private messages and group chats about the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. How extensive is online censorship in China? The government already blocks social media sites and apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Search engines like Google are blocked, and access to many foreign media outlets, including the BBC, is restricted. Other encrypted messaging apps, such as Telegram, are also blocked in China. The government has also pledged to clamp down on users who try to get around the restrictions, by tightening regulations on VPNs. How popular is WhatsApp in China? WhatsApp has more than a billion monthly active users globally, as does Facebook's native messenger. In China, though, WhatsApp is far less popular than local competitors like WeChat, which has over half a billion monthly active users. The Chinese apps are unencrypted and subject to censorship. The censorship of search engines, social media and other online services has worked to the benefit Chinese businesses like Tencent, Alibaba and WeChat , who have created their own successful brands with limited foreign competition.","Users of the encrypted messaging service WhatsApp have reported disruptions in China, prompting censorship claims."
"The eurozone's largest bank said new loans rose by 5% in the year to €7.6bn, while it reduced costs by 1%.

Santander said profits rose in all its 10 key markets for the first time since the start of the financial crisis. Europe contributed 52% to the group´s overall profits led by the UK (19%) and Spain (14%). Latin America accounted for 38% of profits, with Brazil (19%) and Mexico (8%) leading the way, while the remaining profit came from the US. The annual results are the first under new chair Ana Botin, who replaced her father Emilio Botin after his death in September 2014. Ms Botin has moved away from the serial acquisitions of her late father, though she has said she wants to preserve Santander's international presence which has helped to shield the group from local crises.

"The 133-year-old company said it would also end production of video cameras and digital picture frames. Kodak said it would concentrate on more profitable divisions such as photo printing and desktop inkjet printers. The company, which entered bankruptcy protection from its creditors last month, said that the changes should save about $100m (£63m) a year. Kodak said in a statement that it had been cutting its exposure to loss-making operations for some time. ""Today's announcement is the logical extension of that process, given our analysis of the industry trends,"" said Pradeep Jotwani, president and chief marketing officer at Kodak. The company will continue to honour product warranties and provide technical support for the discontinued products. Kodak said it was working with its retailers to ensure an orderly transition. The move to seek bankruptcy protection came after Kodak failed to sell its catalogue of digital imaging patents last year.

"The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said like-for-like sales, which strip out the effect of new store openings, fell by 4.2% compared with April 2017. Total sales were 3.1% down year-on-year, the sharpest fall since the BRC started collecting data 23 years ago. While a lot of Easter spending was done in late March, not April, the figures were still worrying, the BRC said. The industry body has been publishing its monthly BRC-KPMG retail sales monitor since January 1995. Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive said: ""A drop in sales this April... was almost inevitable given the earlier timing of Easter. With much of the spending in preparation for the Bank Holiday weekend falling in March this year, a record low in sales growth, in contrast to last year's record high, does not come as a surprise. ""However, even once we take account of these seasonal distortions, the underlying trend in sales growth is heading downwards,"" she said. Fashion sales rose, according to the data, but food and grocery fell. Ms Dickinson said: ""The first glimpse of summer may have temporarily lifted clothing and footwear, but non-food sales overall continue to be weak. ""Consumers' discretionary spending power remains under pressure and the reality is, that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers."" Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the figures underline why retailers are struggling and several have announced closures and restructurings.

"By Theo LeggettBusiness correspondent, BBC News Dr Johan van Zyl said such an outcome would create a ""very negative investment environment"" in Britain and be ""very, very negative"" for his business. He told the BBC the combination of Brexit and the Covid crisis was a ""double whammy"" for the carmaker. Toyota has two plants in the UK, which employ about 3,000 people in total. But Mr van Zyl said no decisions on the future of its UK plants - a car factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire and an engine facility at Deeside in North Wales - could be taken until the outcome of trade talks was known. Like other manufacturers, Toyota has been badly affected by the Covid outbreak. Both its UK plants were forced to suspend production during the spring lockdown, while showrooms were also forced to close. Now the company is forecasting a strong recovery for its European business. But according to Dr van Zyl, its UK recovery could be made more difficult by Brexit. ""We have Brexit, and we have Covid, and this is a double whammy which is happening to us"", he said during an online media event. ""When it comes to the recovery… it's going to be more difficult if Brexit of course is negative, or a hard Brexit"". The company has, he said, already taken steps to mitigate the impact of a no-deal scenario - but there is a limit to what it can do. Investment ""What we could put in place, we have done - in terms of adjusting our systems, looking at customs procedures which will be required, looking at increasing stock levels. ""Up to a point we can do it. But you can't do a huge amount of that - it's only a limited few days. ""So it can be very, very negative for our business if we have a no-deal scenario. Very negative. And even if there is a deal, we need to know the content of the deal. We need to get those details to really be able to establish what is the real impact. We haven't seen those yet"". It is not yet clear what the future holds for Toyota's UK plants. The company recently invested £240m in equipping the Burnaston factory to build its latest vehicle platforms. Dr van Zyl insists that: ""We have confidence in our colleagues in the UK. They're doing an excellent job so far"". 'Difficult situation' But the longer-term outlook may be bleaker, in an industry where product cycles tend to last around seven years. ""We have always said that if, for instance Brexit, is very negative, it will be a very negative investment environment, so we need first to see the outcome before we can judge what we are really going to do"", he says. Tariffs on cross channel trade, he explains, could make a big difference. ""If 90% of what you produce in the UK is exported to the EU, and you've got to do it at a duty, then you're not competitive. You will not be able to compete with plants in Europe. So it is a very difficult situation ""But let's see what the outcome of the negotiations is, then we can really decide what we're going to do.""",The boss of Toyota's European business has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its UK plants uncompetitive.
"There have been doubts over Facebook's ability to sell adverts on mobile devices, not least due to their small screen size. Investors had feared that its growth may be hurt as a result. However, Facebook said 30% of its $1.25bn (£803m) advertising revenue in the first quarter came from mobile. It reported a net profit of $219m for the January to March quarter. ""We've made a lot of progress in the first few months of the year,"" said Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg. But increased spending on infrastructure, together with the fact the firm now employs more people than it did a year ago, contributed to a 60% jump in costs and expenses to $1.1bn in the quarter. 'They are delivering' Ever since its launch, Facebook has enjoyed tremendous growth and has gone on to dominate the social networking sector. However, an increasing number of users are accessing the site on their mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet PCs. The screens of these gadgets are much smaller compared with traditional PCs or laptops. That had led to concerns that Facebook may find it tough to sell advertising space on these and turn its online dominance into profits. These concerns have hurt the firm's share price ever since its high profile initial public offering (IPO) last year. However, analysts said the latest numbers indicate that the firm is keeping up with changing patterns. ""They are making the transition to mobile faster than anyone anticipated,"" said Arvind Bhatia, an analyst with Sterne Agee. ""It seems like they are delivering."" According to Facebook, it generated mobile advertising revenue of almost $375m, during the period, up from nearly $330m in the previous three months and approximately $150m in the three months to 30 September 2012. 'In full force' Facebook also reported an increase in users who access Facebook every day, these, on average, rose 8% from December to 655 million in March. That had been another area of concern for investors, amid talk of so-called ""Facebook fatigue"" among users. Analysts said the numbers indicated that the site continued to remain popular. ""The network remains in full force,'' said Brian Blau, an analyst with Gartner. ""You have to give them a lot of credit.'' For its part, Facebook has taken various steps in recent months to make sure it keeps its dominant place in the sector. It has overhauled its newsfeed and search feature, and launched Facebook Home, an app for Android phones. The app, which effectively replaces the phone's home screen with a Facebook feed and chat options, has received mixed reviews from users. Some analysts said that the firm had managed to fend off competition in the sector. ""There is always going to be something new in social,"" said Nate Elliot of Forrester Research. ""The question is how much of it is a threat to Facebook? All Facebook can do is keep those users coming back and make money off those users. ""And Facebook seems to be doing both of those things reasonably well.""","Facebook has reported a jump in mobile advertising revenue, easing investor concerns over its future growth."
"The Brazilian label has been highly successful at home and internationally, with about 200 million pairs of the footwear sold every year. Alpargatas, the firm behind the brand, was owned by the scandal-hit J&F group, which manages the fortune of the billionaire Batista family. It is being bought by three prominent Brazilian banking groups. Thongs and jandals The sale of Sao Paulo-based Alpargatas was widely expected, and is part of J&F's strategy to offload businesses after it was involved in a series of corruption scandals. It is understood proceeds from the sale - to Cambuhy Investimentos, Itaúsa Investimentos and the fund Brasil Warrant - will help repay debt and go towards fines of more than $3bn the company has been hit with. Flip-flops are known as thongs in Australia, jandals in New Zealand, slops in South Africa and slippers in parts of Asia. But in Brazil - and elsewhere - they are commonly referred to by the brand name Havaianas. Famed for their colourful designs and association with the Brazilian beach-lifestyle, the company has also benefitted from celebrity association. Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Aniston, Selena Gomez and Sienna Miller are among the stars who have been pictured wearing them.",The maker of Havaianas - perhaps the world's most famous brand of flip-flops - has been sold for $1.1bn ($850m).
"In an open letter to staff, Vincent de Rivaz said he regretted the uncertainty for employees, the local community and suppliers to the £18bn Somerset site. But he said he understood why the new UK cabinet needed a ""little time"". The government said it was ""only right"" to review such a significant deal and it would decide by the autumn. French energy group EDF approved funding for Hinkley Point C at a board meeting on Thursday and contracts were due to be signed by all the parties involved the following day. 'We are ready' But in a surprise announcement, Business Secretary Greg Clark issued a brief statement saying ministers would take until the early autumn to ""consider carefully all the component parts"" of the project. Mr de Rivaz, who held a meeting with Mr Clark on Friday, says in his letter: ""The new prime minister has been in post for just 16 days. Her full cabinet has been in post even fewer. ""We can understand their need to take a little time. We fully respect the prime minister's method."" Mr de Rivaz, who is chief executive of EDF Energy plc, added: ""The very good news is that we are ready. ""The board's decision means that when the government is ready to go ahead, we are ready too."" How much would Hinkley C cost bill payers? Carrie Gracie: Is China the hitch for Hinkley Point? Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes bet Kamal Ahmed: Why did chancellor tell me Hinkley 'will go ahead' five days ago? Hinkley delay reactions from Somerset What now for Hinkley Point? Mr de Rivaz says Hinkley Point C will ""deliver high-quality jobs for people of diverse backgrounds in Somerset and in all the regions of the country"" and ""is consistent with Theresa May's vision"". He added: ""My message today is one of continuity and confidence. ""The EDF Board's decision is a huge achievement and one we should be proud of. Our journey is a long one and there is a further stage."" Chinese investors 'frustrated' Jean-Bernard Levy, EDF Group chief executive, has also said he remains confident the project will go ahead. But the delayed decision was described as ""bewildering and bonkers"" by the GMB union national secretary for energy Justin Bowden, who fears it could jeopardise 25,000 jobs. Mace, which was appointed by EDF to oversee the contract management at the site and provide project and programme management services, said the decision ""sends completely the wrong signal to investors and the world"". According to the BBC's Newsnight programme, it was security concerns over Chinese ownership of British nuclear power stations that were the primary reason why the prime minister postponed the decision. China General Nuclear Power Corporation is contributing a third of the money for the project. A source close to CGN told the BBC everyone in the company was ""bemused"" and ""frustrated"" by the sudden nature of the government's announcement and it had been given no real insight into the reason for the delay. Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement. 'White elephant' In 2013, the UK committed to pay a price more than twice the market level for the power generated by the plant over 35 years. Critics of the plan have warned of environmental damage and potential escalating costs. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: ""Theresa May now has a chance to stop this radioactive white elephant in its tracks... ""The UK needs to invest in safe, reliable renewable power."" Hinkley Point timeline Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mix Mar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approved Oct 2013 - UK government agrees £92.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the market rate Oct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK government postpones final decision on the project until autumn","The boss of EDF in the UK says he is ""confident"" a new nuclear power station will be built at Hinkley Point, despite the government delaying its decision."
"The rise came despite criticism from investors and government about excessive salaries, the Chartered Institute of Personnel Development (CIPD) said. The highest total payout was £47.1m for Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon. The GMB union called the findings a ""badge of national shame"". According to the CIPD, the median pay for FTSE 100 chief executives was £3.93m last year, up from £3.53m in 2016. That compared with a 2% increase for UK workers as a whole, it said. The HR industry group also found bosses were paid on average 145 times more than their employees - up from 128 times in 2016. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said most workers' wages were still below 2010 levels and were barely keeping up with inflation. ""When they see the fattest cats get fatter yet again with an 11% pay rise, it's no wonder people question the fairness of our society,"" he said. Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said the figures exposed the ""shocking excess"" in UK boardrooms. ""We live in a country where company fat cats get paid 400 times more than the dedicated, hard-working carers who look after our nearest and dearest - not to mention hundreds of times more than those who keep our streets clean, or ambulance workers who save lives."" Tougher rules In June, the government said all companies with more than 250 employees would be required to publish their pay ratios. Unions want ministers to go further, guaranteeing worker representatives on companies' executive pay committees. It follows concerns some bosses have been getting pay packages out of step with company performance. Shareholders have also become more critical, staging a rash of revolts at firms such as Royal Mail, Persimmon and advertising giant WPP. A Department for Business spokesman said: ""While most companies get their responsible business practices right, we understand the anger of workers and shareholders when bosses' pay is out of step with company performance. ""That is why as part of our corporate governance reforms, the UK's largest companies now have to ensure employees' interests are represented in the boardroom and annually publish and explain the pay ratio between senior management and the workers.""","Chief executive pay rose by 11% last year to almost £4m - much higher than rises for workers, a new report found."
"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter Confusion about what is covered by insurance policies is one of the reasons that policyholders fail to receive a payout. Wear and tear, as well as damage caused by a lack of maintenance in homes are also key reasons for claims being rejected, an insurers' group said. In contrast, 99% of motor insurance claims result in a payout. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has published the industry-wide figures for the first time, after analysis of claims made during 2013 and 2014. The success rate figures are based on 6.9 million claims handed by 19 insurers, including 4.3 million motor insurance claims, 1.8 million home insurance claims, and 800,000 travel insurance claims. Rejections The analysis showed that 79% of home insurance policyholders who made a claim were successful, receiving a typical payout of £2,520. Of those whose claims were turned down, some made claims that were valued below the policy excess and others had bought the wrong kind of cover. Many home insurance policies have add-ons that cover certain eventualities, but add extra complexity to renewals. Many were denied due to a failure to maintain their property. For example, roof damage caused by a storm that affects numerous homes in an area is likely to be successful. Roof damage caused because previous faults had been left without the homeowner's attention were less likely to succeed, the ABI said. Policies were designed to cover ""sudden, unexpected and accidental"" events, an ABI spokesman said. Travel insurance claims recorded a success rate of 87%, the ABI said, with an average payout of £884. Reasons for rejection include failure to declare a pre-existing medical condition and failure to prove that belongings have been lost. 'Honesty' Motor insurance claims were successful in 99% of cases, with an average payout of £2,160. Cases and policies tended to be simpler, leading to fewer denied claims. Huw Evans, ABI director general, said that the figures were published in order to gain greater trust from consumers. ""Contrary to popular belief, insurers want to pay honest claims. It helps nobody when customers have bought the wrong product or have not disclosed important information,"" he said. ""So we will use the analysis we are publishing today to drive awareness campaigns to improve even further the acceptance rates for home and travel. Buying insurance should never just be about getting the cheapest price in the quickest time possible, it should be about ensuring you have the right product for your hour of need."" The ABI suggested that people take time to read the terms and conditions when buying or renewing home insurance to check exactly what is covered. Disputes between insurers and individuals that are unresolved often end up with the financial ombudsman. In separate figures published on Tuesday, the Financial Ombudsman Service said there were 5,504 inquiries about buildings insurance from disgruntled customers between April and December last year. Some 38% of cases looked at by the ombudsman were upheld in the customers' favour. Cases were dwarfed by the 178,715 enquiries about payment protection insurance (PPI) received over the same period. In PPI cases, 70% were upheld in the customers' favour.","More than one in five home insurance claims is unsuccessful owing, in part, to the complexity of policies."
"A spokesperson said Ms Lagarde's planned trip to the Middle East ""is being deferred"". She becomes the latest high-profile name to pull out of the event dubbed ""Davos of the Desert"". The moves have come amid outcry over missing journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr Khashoggi, a critic of the government and a columnist for the Washington Post, vanished on 2 October after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Authorities there believe he was killed in the building by Saudi agents, an accusation that the Saudi authorities have dismissed as ""lies"". ""The Managing Director's previously scheduled trip to the Middle East region is being deferred,"" an IMF spokesperson said in a statement, without providing further details. The decision marks a turnaround for Ms Lagarde, who had previously said she was ""horrified"" by reports coming out of Turkey but would still attend the Saudi conference. HSBC's John Flint, Tidjane Thiam of Credit Suisse and JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon are among others who have withdrawn from the event. An introduction to the conference on its official website says it ""will immerse thousands of delegates from all over the world in a rich agenda"". A page with a list of confirmed speakers has been deleted from the website for the conference, which runs from 23 to 25 October.","IMF managing director Christine Lagarde will not attend an investment conference in Riyadh, as global concern over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist grows."
