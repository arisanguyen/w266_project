"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter The Leicester band covered Fatboy Slim's Praise You and Gnarls Barkley's Crazy, and paid tribute to soul legend Bobby Womack, who died this weekend. ""Ten years ago, we opened the Other Stage, when I was just 23,"" said singer Tom Meighan. ""Thank you for this, Glastonbury. So much respect."" The stage was lit in pink as the band took the stage shortly before 22:00 BST, launching into Bumblebee, the first song from their new album 48:13. It was their first headline slot at Glastonbury, but lead singer Meighan was an effective rabble rouser. Dressed in a white tuxedo and bow tie, he instructed the crowd to ""jump all the way back to the hot dog stands"" and led an effective singalong to their closing number, LSF. The band, who have never taken themselves too seriously, brought comedian Noel Fielding onstage dressed as Vlad the Impaler during the song of the same name. Meighan also changed the song's refrain to ""Bobby Womack - see you on the other side"" in respect of the late soul star, whose hit song Across 110th Street played on the PA before Kasabian took the stage. Compared to the po-faced Metallica and the self-consciously quirky Arcade Fire, the band appeared to be enjoying their headline slot. ""We're quite overwhelmed, we're humble,"" Meighan told the BBC before they took to the stage. ""But I've got a feeling about tonight. It's our turn, it's our time. We're going to take this place to pieces."" In the event, Kasabian drew a slightly bigger audience (an estimated 100,000) than either of the other headliners - but not as big as Dolly Parton earlier on Sunday. The final day of the festival opened with a performance from the English National Ballet, who paid tribute to those who died in World War One. Their performance, Dust, was choreographed by Akram Khan, who helped put together the opening of the London 2012 Olympics with Danny Boyle. Sombre but powerful, the performance moved some in the early morning audience to tears. Other acts on the final day included Ed Sheeran, who played the Pyramid Stage unaccompanied, using his acoustic guitar and a series of effects pedals. Despite breaking several strings along the way, he was warmly welcomed by the crowd in the mid-afternoon heat. On The Other Stage, Ellie Goulding delivered an energetic, full-throttle run-through of her biggest dance hits as the sun set, while Disclosure brought several special guest vocalists - including Eliza Doolitle, Sam Smith and Aluna Francis to their headline set at the West Holts stage. Against the bombast of Kasabian, Glastonbury organisers had programmed some more mellow bands to aid the come-down at the end of the festival. Massive Attack's hushed version of Teardrops was a highlight on The Other Stage, while London Grammar's lush, melancholy album If You Wait drew huge crowds to the John Peel Stage. The turnout will have pleased the Brit nominees, who admitted to suffering from a bad case of the jitters before they went on stage. ""I'm terrified,"" singer Hannah Reid told the BBC, two hours before showtime. ""You struggle to feel worthy for Glastonbury. I'm like 'oh no, I'm really a fraud. I can't sing at all and everyone at Glastonbury's going to know'."" But Dolly Parton was the star turn of the day, if not the festival. She charmed the crowd with her ornery banter and diamante-studded hairpiece, and led lusty singalongs to hits such as 9 to 5, Jolene and I Will Always Love You. ""Thanks for singing along with me, I heard you out there,"" she said, sounding genuinely delighted. For the first, and probably last, time Parton also performed a song about Glastonbury's mud that she had written in the early hours of Sunday morning, which included the lyrics: ""Mud, mud, mud, mud/Up to our bums in all this crud."" 'Deal done' The mud will be traded for traffic jams during Monday as the 175,000 revellers leave Worthy Farm and head back home. But festival organiser Michael Eavis has confirmed the event will be back next year, and that he's already booked all three headliners. Prince - widely rumoured to top the bill this year - is still refusing to come to Somerset, but at least one of the bands will be coming from abroad. ""The agent of the band was here last night,"" Eavis told the BBC. ""He was watching Metallica on the platform with me, and he said 'my band want to play a show at Glastonbury next year'. So that deal was done on the platform last night.""","Kasabian have closed the 2014 Glastonbury Festival with a powerful, bombastic set that drew tens of thousands to the Pyramid Stage."
"""Its 10th anniversary seems a fitting time to shut the book,"" said creator Paul Abbott, adding that the death of his father had influenced the decision. The final series, currently filming in Manchester, will comprise 14 episodes. Based around the anarchic Gallagher family, the show was loosely inspired by Abbott's childhood in Burnley. Actor David Threlfall has played the lead role of Frank Gallagher since the show's first episode, shot in 2003 and broadcast the following year. ""We've had an absolute ball making this stuff up for a living,"" said Abbott in a statement. ""We've given back in spades and got away with absolute murder."" James McAvoy, Anne-Marie Duff and Maxine Peake are among the now established actors to have made appearances in the critically acclaimed ratings success. The show went on to spawn a US version, starring William H Macy in the Frank Gallagher role, that will embark upon its third season next year. ""Shameless, ground-breaking when it launched and gob-smacking ever since, has over the years built a loyal following,"" said Jay Hunt, Channel 4's chief creative officer. ""We are in Paul Abbott's debt for bringing his defiantly dysfunctional band of characters to Channel 4.""","The team behind long-running Channel 4 drama Shameless has announced that the show's 11th series, to be broadcast early next year, will be its last."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter The place was heaving with characters. Artists, posers, dealers, curators, billionaires, bureaucrats, fakes, freeloaders, snobs, journalists, pseuds, hustlers, and narcissists all cramming themselves into tiny spaces and noisy halls to get a glimpse of some box-fresh contemporary art. They are not a hip crowd like you might find at Coachella or XJAZZ in Berlin. They are more clamorous than glamorous. Art is a shared interest but not the thing that truly binds them. Money and status are the currencies that count. You don't need both, but you sure as hell need one or the other. This is a once every-other-year event that was established in 1895 to promote Italian art before morphing into an international exhibition with countries competing to be Best in Show. Mussolini latched onto it in the 1930s as a way of promoting his fascist agenda, leaving a faintly uncomfortable air of nationalism around what is now a global contemporary art event based around nation states. Nobody has time for anything more than a quickie. Take a look, take a picture, post to Instagram, move on. It is relentless. The spaces serving free alcohol always seem to be most popular. Or those that have suddenly become ""hot"" as word of some ""amazing work!!!!!"" spreads like a virus through the Giardini Gardens, which serve as the Biennale's picturesque base camp. Anxiety levels are at fever pitch, fuelled by double espressos and a FOMO so profound that you can see the terror lurking in the eyes behind every pair of Tom Ford sunglasses. The scale of the event is staggering. There are 90 national pavilions, each with its own bespoke exhibition featuring the work of an artist, or artists, commissioned to represent the host country. Added to this is a colossal one-off exhibition spanning two massive buildings, which this year has been put together by a curator called Ralph Rugoff whose day job is running the Hayward Gallery on London's Southbank. There's more. As if the aforementioned wasn't enough to satisfy even the most insatiable art lover, there are myriad other off-site shows by those not invited to take part in the main event: a sort of Venice Biennale Fringe, I suppose. No sane person needs this much art, it is totally overwhelming while, paradoxically, also frequently being totally underwhelming. If the Venice Biennale was a climbing rose it would have been hacked back to manageable proportions long ago. But it is not. It is a hugely successful trade show-cum-visitor attraction, to which hundreds of thousands of tourists will venture over the long hot summer looking for meaning, guidance and some intellectual sustenance in our increasingly secular, divided, complicated world. Will they find what they are looking for in the 2019 edition? You'd hope so. I did. Not in the German Pavilion, which contains an austere post-industrial installation so earnest it is unintentionally funny. Quite unlike the French Pavilion opposite, which is hilarious on purpose. The Turner Prize-winning artist Laure Prouvost has created a surreal grotto full of love, humour and ebullient eccentricity. If the Venice Biennale is a theme park of sorts, then Prouvost's invitation to climb into the belly of an octopus is its star attraction. You enter through a narrow back door and step into an excavated basement the artist and her bunch of merry pranksters dug in order to enter the locked Pavilion in January having tunnelled from the bed of Venice's Grand Canal. That's their story anyway. And by way of corroboration, they have laid out their evidence in the room above in the grubby form of dredged detritus such as old plastic bottles, rusted cans and stinking seaweed. The floor is light blue with a translucent, gummy surface that tricks you into thinking you're tiptoeing through dirty canal water. Go with the flow and it eventually leads you into the guts of the artist's eight-limbed cephalopod, which is very dark place. An elegiac film plays amid scattered stone-effect chairs placed on a spongy carpet that genuinely feels as though it could be the lining of an octopus's stomach. It's disconcerting. And nuts: an eccentric but sincere celebration of the wonderful gift that is the human imagination. It might well win the top prize. It'd get my vote. But there is some strong competition. The Lithuanians have built an off-site beach complete with sunbathers whom you peer down upon as they break out into operatic song. And there was a lot of chatter about the Philippine Pavilion, which features an archipelago of glass topped platforms on which you walk and look down at household objects arranged beneath your feet. It was fine, but rather like the glass walkway, hardly shattering. The Ghanaian Pavilion, on the other hand, is excellent and will give Prouvost's watery world a run for its money when it comes to the award of the coveted Golden Lion for Best National Pavilion. It has been designed by the architect David Adjaye who has created a series of galleries of roughly-finished curved walls, on which hangs some first-class art. A group of El Anatsui's famous bottle-top wall hangings fill one space; behind them is a tear-inducing three-screen film by John Akomfrah that tackles climate change, imperialism, and the mistreatment of animals. And best of all, in the circular centre, are nine portrait paintings of imagined subjects by the talented Lynette Yiadom-Boakye (who was a Turner Prize runner up in 2013 the year Laure Prouvost won). Other highlights include Michael Armitage's paintings (and sketches), which are in the main exhibition, as are those by rising star Njideka Akunyili Crosby. Both are well worth seeking out, as is Arthur Jafa: three to see among a plethora of half-baked mechanical contraptions and dreary installations made by various artists who could be collectively known as Phil Hall. Another tip should you decide to take on the Venice Biennale challenge: Carve out some time to see Edmund de Waal's installation at the Jewish Museum (about 30 minutes from the Giardini Gardens by Vaporetto) in the Campo Ghetto Novo. The potter and author of the best-selling memoire Hare with the Amber Eyes has made a delicate and thoughtful group of new work and placed it with sensitivity around the sixteenth-century synagogue, Canton Scuola. By the end of your marathon art trek you'll be ready to finish yourself off with a couple of large Bellinis. The drink that is, not the painter. UPDATE, Saturday 11 May: Winners announced! The Golden Lion winners of 2019 are Lithuania for national pavilion, and Arthur Jafa for individual artist. Congratulations to both worthy winners.","This week's invite only ""Private View"" of the Venice Biennale (which opens today) was one weird affair. It was like being dropped into the middle of a Wes Anderson movie."
"The host was speaking at a charity event in London, where he was auctioning what he described as his ""last lap"" on the Top Gear race track. ""I don't know when I did my last ever lap of the track, before the BBC sacks me,"" he said. An investigation into Clarkson's current suspension following a ""fracas"" with a producer is still ongoing. A report over the incident is due to be handed to director general Tony Hall next week, who will consider the evidence and ""set out any further steps"". The Roundhouse Gala on Thursday saw Clarkson offer to drive someone round the Top Gear track as part of an experience offered during the auction. ""I didn't foresee my sacking, but I would like to do one last lap,"" he said. ""I'll go down to Surrey and I'll do one last lap of that track before the [BBC] sack me. ""And I'll drive somebody around in whatever I can get hold of when I'm sacked, so it's probably an Austin Maestro."" The presenter gave an expletive-filled description of BBC bosses, adding Top Gear had been ""a great show"" but it had been ruined by the corporation. The BBC said it would ""not be offering further commentary"" on any issues involving Clarkson until the current investigation was concluded. The presenter was suspended from Top Gear on 10 March, following an alleged altercation with producer Oisin Tymon. All remaining shows in the current series of Top Gear were pulled following the incident. An online petition calling for the star's reinstatement - set up by political blogger Guido Fawkes - has accrued almost one million signatures since the presenter's suspension. It was delivered to New Broadcasting House on Friday. The petition was delivered by a man dressed as Top Gear test driver ""The Stig"" who arrived at the BBC's London HQ in an armoured vehicle bearing the words ""Bring Back Clarkson"". Clarkson publicly thanked his supporters on Twitter following the petition's delivery. He said: ""Many many thanks to all of the people who have called for my reinstatement. I'm very touched. We shall all learn next week what will happen.""","A video has emerged of Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson saying he expects to be ""sacked"" by the BBC."
"By Sarah Jane GriffithsEntertainment reporter When writer Lisa Lynch was diagnosed with breast cancer at just 28, it wasn't long before she decided a blog - to ""tell it the way I see it"" - was the only way to cope with whatever came next. ""The universe might be in control of what's going on in my body, but I'm in control of what's going on in my blog,"" she wrote. Now her inspirational, funny and ""unflinchingly honest"" blog and book have been turned into a one-off drama starring Sheridan Smith, who Lynch handpicked to play her. ""Lisa got in touch with me through Twitter and said: 'I only want you to play me',"" says Smith. ""I read the book and I was like: 'Wow. Are you sure?' It took me a long time to decide to do it. I wanted to so badly but I was wary of upsetting family members. ""She's amazing and it was an absolute honour. I just hope I did her justice."" Smith says the chance to give a ""no holds barred"" account of the disease and how we all deal with it inspired her to take on the role. ""My favourite line [in the drama] is when [Lisa] goes: 'I'm British. We just don't talk about things like that.' ""And it gets me every time, because we don't. And it's cancer! It touches one in three and every single one of us will, if we haven't experienced it, know a friend who has. ""We should talk about it. It's not a taboo subject. It should be spoken about."" The pair soon struck up a close friendship - calling each other ""SS and LL"" - as Lynch worked closely with writer Nicole Taylor and BBC producers adapting her book. But sadly making the drama has proved ""bittersweet"", as a secondary cancer was diagnosed in 2011 and Lynch died in 2013, aged 33. Producers say they were originally unsure how or whether to even go ahead with the project, as the first draft of the script had ended with Lynch publishing her book. Lynch's family - including husband Pete, played by Paul Nicholls on screen - were involved at every stage of the process, including helping to finish the story. While The C word offers plenty of humour and upbeat moments, Smith - who lost her eldest brother Julian to cancer when he was 18 - says she's been moved to tears each time she's watched it, including at the press screening. ""If you're going to show it, you've got to show it for real,"" says Smith, pointing to a particularly emotional scene where Lynch collapses in the bath. ""One thing I remember when my brother passed from cancer is my mum and dad carrying him up and down stairs and out of the bath. ""If we missed that bit out, it's a bit like going 'oh isn't it fun'. You've got to show the reality too."" As Lynch lost her hair through chemotherapy, Smith sports a variety of wigs in the drama and shaved her head daily during filming. ""My eyebrows were the ones, because you can't shave or do threading, because they can grow back all weird,"" laughs Smith. ""So I had to pluck them individually, that was quite painful - but it was the least I could do."" The C Word's director Tim Kirkby is full of praise for Smith, whose skill as an actress has already seen her pick up a National Television Award for Cilla, a TV Bafta for Mrs Biggs and two Olivier Awards. ""I think Sheridan is one of the most instinctive, truthful actresses we have,"" says Kirkby. ""It comes from within. We didn't rehearse, we went in very open-minded, had a big discussion and then we shot it. We rarely did more than three takes, we wanted it to be unflinching. ""She just had a real spirit. Only Sheridan could capture Lisa's spirit really."" Smith in turn says she is ""so grateful"" to Lynch for having singled her out for the role. ""It did change my life. I might be sat here sobbing, but I'm so pleased I did it. If it makes one girl check her boob, if it does one thing, we can carry on her legacy. ""[Lisa was] amazing and inspirational and I hope for everyone that watches it she will be."" The C Word can be seen on Sunday 3 May on BBC One at 2030 BST.","Sheridan Smith hopes powerful new drama The C Word, based on Lisa Lynch's acclaimed book and blog, will encourage people to talk more honestly about cancer."
"The Grammy-winning songwriter died on Tuesday, aged 73, due to Covid-19 complications, his publicist confirmed. Prine had been in hospital in Nashville since last week with coronavirus symptoms, with his wife and manager, Fiona Whelan Prine, posting updates about his condition online. Prine was revered by his peers including Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash. ""John and I were 'New Dylans' together in the early 70s and he was never anything but the lovliest guy in the world,"" tweeted The Boss. ""A true national treasure and a songwriter for the ages."" Prine signed with Atlantic Records and released his self-titled debut album in 1971, after fellow singer-songwriter, Kris Kristofferson, saw him perform in a Chicago club. The album included songs like Angel from Montgomery, Paradise, and Sam Stone, which gave bittersweet tragic-comic snapshots of American society and fed into the anti-war movement. After serving in the US army in Germany during the Vietnam war, Prine returned home to Chicago where he worked as a postman. While doing his mail rounds, he wrote songs that would see him emerge, from open mic nights, as a key player on the windy city's folk revival scene in the 1970s and go on to become one of America's most influential artists. ""I likened the mail route to being in a library without any books. You just had time to be quiet and think, and that's where I would come up with a lot of songs,"" Prine told the Chicago Tribune in a 2010 interview. ""If the song was any good I could remember it later and write it down,"" 'Beautiful songs' Speaking to the Huffington Post in 2009, Dylan - who performed with Prine - described his music as ""pure Proustian existentialism"". ""Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. And he writes beautiful songs."" Robbie Robertson, from The Band - who used to back Dylan - described Prine as ""a genius"". ""His work... a beacon of clear white light cutting through the dark days,"" added former Led Zeppelin frontman and solo star Robert Plant. ""His charm, humour and irony we shall miss greatly."" He won his first of four Grammy Awards in 1991, for The Missing Years, which bagged best contemporary folk album. It was a category he would top again in 2005 for Fair and Square. ""We join the world in mourning the passing of revered country and folk singer/songwriter John Prine,"" the Recording Academy wrote in a statement. ""Widely lauded as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, John's impact will continue to inspire musicians for years to come. We send our deepest condolences to his loved ones."" Prine underwent cancer surgery on his throat in 2008 - and on his lungs in 2013 - but joked that it had actually improved his singing voice. ""If I can make myself laugh about something I should be crying about, that's pretty good,"" he said. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"WINNER: BIRDMAN Director: Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Cast includes: Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, Edward Norton, Naomi Watts, Lindsay Duncan, Andrea Riseborough What's the story? In this black comedy, former movie superhero actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton) hopes to revive his washed up career by putting on Broadway play. Fact: Using some clever camerawork, the film looks as though it was shot in a single take. What the critics say: ""The director's surrealist portrait of modern times and the cult of celebrity is brilliant on so many levels that even the occasional downdraft can't keep Birdman from soaring."" Betsey Sharkey, LA Times AMERICAN SNIPER Director: Clint Eastwood Cast includes: Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller What's the story? Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (Cooper) is sent to Iraq where his pinpoint accuracy with a gun makes him the most lethal sniper in US military history, but his reputation also makes him a prime target behind enemy lines. Fact: Rabat in Morocco doubled for Iraq, with members of the Moroccan army serving as extras in some scenes. What the critics say: ""Less a war movie than a western — the story of a lone gunslinger facing down his nemesis in a dusty, lawless place — it is blunt and effective, though also troubling."" AO Scott, The New York Times BOYHOOD Director: Richard Linklater Cast includes: Ethan Hawke, Patricia Arquette, Ellar Coltrane, Lorelei Linklater What's the story? Filmed over short periods from 2002 to 2013, this coming-of-age drama covers 12 years in the life of a family. At the centre is Mason (played by newcomer Coltrane), who with his sister Samantha takes the journey from childhood to adulthood. Fact: For the role of Mason's older sister Sam, Linklater cast his then nine-year-old daughter Lorelei. He said: ""She was at that age when she was singing and dancing and being extroverted and at that moment, she really wanted to do it. It was also a really practical choice because I at least had a little bit of control over her availability."" What the critics say: ""Boyhood is not just a genuine epic, not just beautiful and moving, it looks like a classic already."" David Sexton, London Evening Standard THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL Director: Wes Anderson Cast includes: Ralph Fiennes, Tony Revolori, Saoirse Ronan, Bill Murray, Jude Law, Edward Norton, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman What's the story? Gustave H (Fiennes), a concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa (Revolori), the lobby boy, become embroiled in an adventure involving a priceless Renaissance painting. Fact: The film is shot in different aspect ratios to reflect the different periods of the story. What the critics say: ""Grand isn't good enough a word for this Budapest Hotel. Great is more like it."" Richard Corliss, Time THE IMITATION GAME Director: Morten Tyldum Cast includes: Benedict Cumberbatch, Matthew Goode, Keira Knightley, Mark Strong, Rory Kinnear, Charles Dance What's the story? In this wartime drama, computer pioneer Alan Turing (Cumberbatch) and his team at Bletchley Park attempt to decipher Nazi messages to help end World War Two. Fact: Filming locations included Bletchley Park, in Buckinghamshire, and Turing's former school, Sherborne, in Dorset. What the critics say: ""Its various riffs on codes, whether moral, sexual, societal or German, are plain to see rather than enigmatic or enlightening. Luckily it's all anchored in a storming performance from Cumberbatch: you'll be deciphering his work long after the credits roll."" Dave Calhoun, Time Out SELMA Director: Ava DuVernay Cast includes: David Oyelowo, Tom Wilkinson, Carmen Ejogo, Tim Roth, Oprah Winfrey What's the story? Over three months in 1965, Martin Luther King Jr (Oyelowo) goes up against President Lyndon B Johnson (Wilkinson) and attempts to lead marches from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama on a quest for equal voting rights. Fact: Selma was shot largely in the state of Alabama in many of the same locations where the momentous events of 1965 took place. What the critics say: ""Hollywood's definitive depiction of the 1960s American civil rights movement — as well as perhaps the most timely movie you'll see this year."" Lou Lumenick, New York Post THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING Director: James Marsh Cast includes: Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones, Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, David Thewlis What's the story? At Cambridge University in 1963, cosmology student Stephen Hawking (Redmayne) falls in love with arts undergraduate Jane Wilde (Jones), and is shortly afterwards diagnosed with motor neurone disease. The film - based on the memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, by Jane Hawking - is a portrait of a marriage shaped and tested by extremes of illness and academic success. Fact: Hawking allowed the filmmakers to use his trademarked computerized voice to replace the synthetic version they had originally used. What the critics say: ""Despite its title, The Theory of Everything is less about astrophysics and more about the quantum mechanics of human relationships under pressure."" Kate Muir, The Times WHIPLASH Director: Damien Chazelle Cast includes: Miles Teller, JK Simmons, Melissa Benoist What's the story? Young jazz drummer Andrew Neyman (Teller), a student at a New York music conservatory, aspires to be the best. He joins a school band led by music instructor Terence Fletcher infamous for his terrifying methods. Fact: Like his character in the film, Miles Teller did actually play the drums until his hands bled. What the critics say: ""You don't have to be a jazz fan for Whiplash to zap you with its thrumming live-wire beat (although it doesn't hurt). If you can appreciate the sight of two totally dialed-in performers simmering until they boil over, that's enough."" Chris Nashawaty, Entertainment Weekly",A look at the best picture nominees at the 87th Academy Awards.
"The glam-rock legend has released the recording Where Are We Now? as a video and download. It will be followed by a new album, The Next Day, in March. Bowie has not performed live since 2006 and has rarely been seen in public since then. The new track was recorded in New York and produced by the singer's long-time collaborator Tony Visconti. Speaking to the BBC, Visconti admitted that keeping the project a secret has been difficult. ""People have asked what I've been working on and I've said 'I can't tell you... a mystery project... Project X,' so its such a relief that its out on that level."" Visconti continued: ""The material is so strong and beautiful - if people are looking for classic Bowie they'll find that on this album, but if they're looking for innovative Bowie, they'll find that on this album too. It's all there."" Bowie's long absence from the industry and heart surgery in 2004 had prompted speculation about his health. However, Visconti insisted the singer ""is extremely healthy and rosy cheeked."" ""His stamina is fantastic,"" he added. The single's appearance online was ""a genuine surprise"", said John Wilson, presenter of BBC Radio 4's Front Row. ""He's a proper artist. He doesn't release records because it's time for another record. He releases records when there's something for him to say."" Where Are We Now? is a simple, unfussy ballad - Bowie singing mournfully over a piano motif that slowly builds to an understated coda. The song includes several references to the city of Berlin, where Bowie and Visconti produced a critically-acclaimed trilogy of albums - Low, Heroes and Lodger - in the 1970s. ""If you listen to each of the verses, there are lyrical references to Berlin, to Potsdamer Platz, to Nuremberg Strasse,"" said Wilson. ""Places where he lived when he was making those albums. And there is an elegiac quality. There's a sadness, I think. A weariness to his voice."" The artwork for the new album, which has surfaced on iTunes, is an altered version of the cover to Heroes, suggesting a further connection to the Berlin Trilogy. 'Mystique' By breaking his 10-year musical silence, Bowie unsurprisingly prompted a flurry of praise on Twitter. ""I'm so insanely excited,"" journalist Caitlin Moran wrote. ""It's like hearing King Arthur's voice from the cave."" Comedian David Walliams added: ""I love that Bowie has kept his mystique. No word from him for years and then out of nowhere this beautiful song appears. ""I wonder whether Bowie will go on Loose Women to promote it?"" Music fan Chris Lilley wrote: ""It's quite an elaborate way to apologise for not performing at the Olympics."" While Bowie's son, film director Duncan Jones, chipped in: ""Would be lovely if all of you could spread the word about da's new album. First in ten years, and its a good 'un!"" Acknowledging the stealthy release of the single, the pop star's press representative said in a statement: ""Throwing shadows and avoiding the industry treadmill is very David Bowie"". The Space Oddity star, it continued, was ""the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants"". Where Are We Now? is accompanied by a video directed by multimedia and installation artist Tony Oursler, which harks back to Bowie's time in Berlin. The promo, which can be viewed via the singer's website, features his face projected onto the body of a puppet. The face of a woman is projected onto the mannequin beside him, with Bowie appearing in more conventional form later on in the video, clutching a notebook and wearing a T-shirt with the logo for the classic operetta Song Of Norway. Bowie, who was last reported to be living in New York with his wife and daughter, has not released material since his 2003 album Reality. In September, the singer denied reports he was involved in an upcoming exhibition at the Victoria and Albert museum in London charting his career.","Singer David Bowie has released a new single on his 66th birthday, following years of silence and speculation."
"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News TV stations broadcasting news and entertainment to specific towns and cities are nothing new in many countries. In the UK, though, attempts to set up local TV stations have largely fallen flat. Now Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is making a concerted attempt to establish dozens of stations. Under his plans, the stations would broadcast on channel eight on Freeview in England and Northern Ireland, and on a different channel in Scotland and Wales. The first 20 would go on air in 2013 and would broadcast for a minimum of an hour a day. There are big questions over whether these stations will attract enough money from advertisers to survive. To attract advertisers, they need viewers. And to get viewers, they need decent programmes that will compete with national channels. Asked what would be on, Mr Hunt mentions local news and says local democracy will play ""a very big part"". He says the televised leaders' debates invigorated the general election campaign in 2010, and believes local TV could have the same effect in individual constituencies and at local elections. He also mentions sport, with the prospect of local TV stations signing deals with big football clubs to provide behind-the-scenes coverage. ""I don't think we'll have any shortage of things to put on these stations,"" he says. But how can they compete with the big budgets and high production values of the national networks? ""They'll be unique because the national stations won't be covering those local stories,"" Mr Hunt replies. ""That will be their big, big selling point."" Debra Davis of City TV, which is hoping to run channels in Birmingham and possibly beyond, is inspired by success stories in her native Canada. One channel in Toronto was ""edgy, fun and exciting"", she says. Asked whether a flagship programme could be a live magazine-style prime time show with talented young presenters, she replies: ""Yes, absolutely. ""There's no way that we can afford to do a CSI, for instance, or Downton Abbey,"" she continues. ""I'm under no illusions. ""But I can promise audiences that they will be impressed with the talent that exists locally. ""Beyond the news and current affairs offering, I think Birmingham has the capacity to have a strong schedule of arts, entertainment, music, interview shows, magazine shows, sports [and] children's shows."" YourTV, meanwhile, is hoping to run channels in Birmingham, Stoke, Liverpool and Sheffield. ""We're very keen to involve the audience as much as possible,"" says director Lin Glover. ""We're called YourTV for a reason."" Programmes would be about people and places that viewers know, she says, citing the popularity of shows that rely on user-generated footage such as You've Been Framed. ""ITV, and the BBC too on a regional level, have lost that character and personality in the output, and that's basically what local TV can do,"" she says. The last 20 years of British broadcasting have seen a number of attempts to set up local stations. One of them - Birmingham station Sangat TV, available on Sky or online, which is run on a shoestring by four Sikh men - has been praised by Mr Hunt. More nimble and closer to the local community, it scooped major broadcasters with its footage of the recent riots in the city. Seven, a cable channel operating in north Lincolnshire since 1998, is one of the longest-running local stations, with a catalogue of programmes that look highly professional. Yet most local stations have struggled. Live TV, a cable network set up in 1995 and best remembered for topless darts and the news bunny, ran a chain of local stations in cities including Birmingham, Edinburgh and Manchester. Peter Brookes, who ran the Birmingham channel and now lectures in journalism at Staffordshire University, says his station was breaking even by the time it was shut in 1999. ""However, that did involve what I would call some rather interesting post-midnight programming,"" he points out. In Manchester, Channel M, set up in 2000, produced some acclaimed news, entertainment, sport and music shows before being shut by its owners, the Guardian Media Group, last year. Former chief executive Mark Dodson says it proved local stations could produce ""high quality, low cost television"". It failed, he says, because there was no way to get national advertisers and no reliable way of measuring local audiences in order to tell advertisers how many people were watching. The government originally planned for the new local stations to be attached to a national ""spine"" - a company that, among other things, would sell advert slots to national companies on their behalf. But that plan has been dropped because Mr Hunt said many potential channel owners did not want to be tied to a national organisation. 'Game changer' The new channels will have some advantages over their predecessors though. The first is a high channel slot on Freeview, and therefore a higher profile than local channels have had in the past. Freeview is in 75% of UK homes. The high channel slot is ""the game changer"", according to Jamie Conway, managing director of Element Television, which is hoping to bid for up to 15 licences. The second advantage is £25m of set-up funding, to be shared between the channels from the BBC licence fee, followed by a guaranteed £5m a year for the first three years. But many in the media remain sceptical that local TV can get off the ground. As former Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, who ran Live TV, put it at a conference last November: ""The idea of local TV is a complete disaster and anybody going into it is completely nuts."" Comedian and columnist David Mitchell recently wrote that spending millions on ""some provincial camcorder-and-advert channels is not in the national, or local, interest"". Mr Hunt has staked a lot on the plan and is determined to see the channels get off the ground. But whether the live broadcast of his next parliamentary husting will be as appealing as The X Factor remains to be seen.","In four years, if government plans come to fruition, 50 locations up and down the UK will have their own TV channels. Will they be worth watching?"

""I have the ability, occasionally, of being able to step out and see who you think I could end up being. And I like to play with that."" On writing ""I always wrote. I wrote from when I was 12. That was therapeutic for me in those days. I wrote things to get them out of feeling them, and on to paper. ""So writing in a way saved me, kept me company.

"The annual event will also move from the Grosvenor House Hotel in central London to the Roundhouse in Camden. Mercury Prize managing director Dan Ford said the plans would generate ""more interest in the shortlisted artists and albums than ever before"". Elbow, The XX and PJ Harvey have won the Mercury Prize in recent years. The award, traditionally presented by broadcaster Jools Holland, celebrates the best British or Irish album of the year. The new four-year agreement also includes a series of gigs around London from the 12 shortlisted acts. The nominees for this year's prize will be announced on 12 September, with the winner named on 1 November. BBC Radio 2 and 6 Music controller Bob Shennan said: ""We are proud to have supported the Mercury Prize for the past 15 years and wish it the best of luck for the future.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The accolade caps a stellar year for the Korean boyband, who released two chart-topping albums in 2020 - Map of the Soul: 7 and Be. The boyband beat Taylor Swift, who took the crown last year, into second place. They are the first non-Western act to win, and the first whose songs are not predominantly sung in English. The award is calculated according to an artist or group's worldwide sales, downloads and streams, covering their whole body of work. Drake came third, with The Weeknd fourth and Billie Eilish at number five. BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, were formed in 2013 and consists of seven members - Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook - who come from all over South Korea. They've subsequently become standard-bearers for the K-pop scene, selling millions of records and concert tickets, while racking up billions of streams. The group was the brainchild of veteran writer and producer Bang Shi Hyuk, who formerly worked at the K-pop entertainment giant JYP, then formed Big Hit Entertainment and put BTS together around group leader, RM. Last year, he floated Big Hit Entertainment on the Korean stock market - resulting in the band members receiving a $108 million (£77 million) windfall. It more than made up for their inability to tour amid the Covid pandemic. The gap in their schedule also allowed BTS to record their second album of the year, which they billed as a ""letter of hope"" to fans. The record contained Dynamite - their first single to be recorded entirely in English, which topped the US charts in August, after breaking one-day streaming records in the US. Dynamite also earned BTS a Grammy nomination in the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category, alongside stars like Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift. Frances Moore, chief executive of IFPI, said: ""BTS are a global phenomenon. They have had another outstanding year... and [are] continually finding creative and engaging ways to share their story with the world. ""They truly show the power that music has to bring joy and happiness to people the world over.

"Armitage will donate his £5,000 salary as poet laureate to help fund the annual Laurel Prize. He said he hopes it will promote thought, discussion and works about the impact of issues like climate change. The inaugural winner will receive £5,000 and will be announced next May. There will also be a second prize of £2,000 and a third prize of £1,000. Armitage said: ""Over the course of my 10-year laureateship I want one of the headline projects to be a prize or award that recognises the resurgence of nature and environmental writing currently taking place in poetry, to this end I have decided to create The Laurel Prize. ""The new wave of nature writing in non-fiction has been well documented over recent years but not enough attention has been paid to a similar move in poetry, with climate crisis and environmental concerns clearly provoking this important strand of work."" He added: ""I want the prize to celebrate and reward that work, to encourage more of it, and to be part of the discourse and awareness about our current environmental predicament."" The 56-year-old, who studied geography at Portsmouth Polytechnic, has himself written widely about nature in a career spanning three decades - from accounts of trekking the Pennine Way to a recent collection, The Unaccompanied, about an endangered world in meltdown. 'Meaningful and generous' The prize will be run by national arts charity the Poetry School, which also runs the annual Ginkgo Prize for ecopoetry. The Ginkgo Prize is for best single poem and is open to poets from around the world, whereas the Laurel Prize will be for a collection and only open to poets in the UK and Republic of Ireland. Executive director Sally Carruthers said she was ""delighted"" to be working with the poet laureate on ""such a meaningful and generous project"". She said: ""To be able to use poetry to reach new audiences with impactful and emotive environmental messages at a time of crisis is an honour. We need imagination to envisage the potential devastation of our planet and to be moved to enact change - poets have the imaginations to convey these messages in a way which will resonate with us all."" The prize will be judged by Armitage, fellow poet Moniza Alvi and author Robert Macfarlane. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme on Thursday, Armitage also read out a new poem of his own, which was inspired by road closures in his Yorkshire village to allow the Tour de France cyclists to pass through in 2014. ""It was like we'd gone back 200 years or gone forward 200 years, to a world where there wasn't any traffic,"" he said. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten and BBC director general Tony Hall were questioned last week by MPs over £25m paid to 150 outgoing executives. Several BBC witnesses who gave evidence will be recalled, said a PAC spokesman. They include Lord Patten and BBC HR director Lucy Adams. Mr Thompson, who now works for the New York Times, did not attend the committee on 10 July. Others appearing in September are BBC Trustee Anthony Fry, former trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons and a former senior independent director, Marcus Agius. Lord Patten told the Public Accounts Committee last Wednesday that he had been ""shocked and dismayed"" by £25m in pay-offs to senior managers. He added that if Mr Thompson was called before MPs, he would be ""as interested as you are, why we didn't know"". But Mr Thompson later said the Trust had been told ""in writing, as well as orally"". The PAC meeting followed the publication of a report in which the National Audit Office (NAO) criticised the corporation, saying the scale of the payments risked public trust. In its report, the NAO provided analysis of several case studies, one of which was the former deputy director general Mark Byford who was paid £949,000, which included £73,000 for unused leave. In a statement last week, Mr Thompson said he was ""looking forward to laying the facts in front of the Public Accounts Committee in person, but there are a couple of inaccuracies that emerged in yesterday's testimony to the PAC which I would like to clear up immediately"".","The former director general of the BBC, Mark Thompson, will appear before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on 9 September to answer questions about BBC executive pay-offs."
"The dystopian 1982 classic, directed by Ridley Scott, was loosely based on a Philip K Dick novel. Mead worked as a concept designer on the film, as well as on others including Star Trek, Aliens and Tron. He died on Monday of complications from lymphoma. His death was confirmed to the press by his husband Roger Servick. 'Visualise the future' Mead - who began his career as an industrial designer for the Ford Motor Company - was due to receive the Art Directors Guild's William Cameron Menzies Award at the organisation's annual ceremony in February. Last month, ADG president Nelson Coates said Mead had played ""a pivotal role in shaping cinema"", noting his ""singular ability to visualise the future"". He added: ""As one of the most influential conceptual artists of our time, his visions and illustrations of future technological worlds will remain as a testament to his vast imagination."" In an interview in 2015, Mead explained where he got the inspiration for his futuristic city landscapes in Blade Runner, which was set in Los Angeles in the distant 2019. ""For a city in 2019, which isn't that far from now, I used the model of Western cities like New York or Chicago that were laid out after the invention of mass transit and automobiles, with grids and linear transport,"" he told Curbed. ""I thought, we're at 2,500 feet now, let's boost it to 3,000 feet, and then pretend the city has an upper city and lower city. The street level becomes the basement, and decent people just don't want to go there."" He added: ""In my mind, all the tall buildings have a sky lobby, and nobody goes below the 30th floor, and that's the way life would be organised."" Engineer and technology entrepreneur Elon Musk was among those paying tribute on Twitter. Mead also designed the much-loved Johnny 5 robot for the 1986 comedy science film Short Circuit, about a military robot that gains humanlike intelligence after being struck by lightning. In 2013, Mead was reminded by Autoline journalist John McElroy that he had predicted the emergence of the self-driving car, or ""electric herd"", back in 1980, comparing it to a horse being able to carry a drunk cowboy home from the saloon.

"By Emma JonesEntertainment reporter She may have had many of the best lines on Game of Thrones, but Dame Diana Rigg says she has not watched the series ""before or since"" she appeared in it. Accepting a special award at this year's Canneseries TV festival in France, the British actress said she ""hadn't got a clue"" about what was happening on the show. Olenna left at the end of the last series by drinking poison - a death scene she said was ""just wonderful"". ""She does it with dignity and wit, and wit is not often in final death scenes,"" says the actress, who will celebrate her 81st birthday in July. The young Rigg became famous in the 1960s for playing Emma Peel in TV series The Avengers. Being offered Tyrell in 2013, she says, echoed the circumstances of her first starring role. ""They just called my agent,"" she explains. ""The world turns full circle, because just like with The Avengers, I wasn't watching Game of Thrones and had absolutely no idea of its influence in the world. ""It was a job, they sent me a script, and I thought 'I can do this.' ""Interestingly enough, they tested me very early on,"" the actress recalls. ""One of my earliest scenes was incredibly difficult, listing all the things my marching army would need. ""It went on forever, talking about the sheep and the cows and the soldiers. I read that and thought, 'these guys are testing an old actress to see if she can get it into her head.' ""I thought, 'I'm going to do it in one take.' And I did."" Rigg is also known for playing Tracy, the only woman who became Mrs James Bond, in 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Given the choice, though, she'd choose Olenna every time. ""I love playing bad [characters],"" she says. ""They are so much more interesting than good. ""There are some actors who don't like to play bad; they like to be liked. I love to be disliked. Olenna had the best lines, they were very kind with their scripts."" The issue of pay equality in the film industry has been highlighted of late, not least by the revelation that Michelle Williams was paid a fraction of what Mark Wahlberg earned for reshooting scenes in All the Money in the World. Rigg is highly supportive of Williams and her backing for the US Paycheck Fairness Act, having discovered while working on The Avengers that she was being paid less than one of its cameramen. ""I remember thinking, 'something's very wrong here,'"" she explains. ""When I complained publicly, the newspapers got hold of it, and I was represented as a mercenary young woman stepping out of line and demanding money. ""I was lonely as well because no one supported me. I did get more money, but thereafter I was labelled as go-getting and 'hard' - and it was unfair because I wasn't. ""The fight goes on,"" she continues. ""I wonder if anyone's done a survey as to whether people go to watch a male or a female lead. ""I go to see a female lead as often as a male one, so why there's disparity in the pay cheque I have no idea. Bosses need to be talked to about this."" Dame Diana was honoured in Cannes for a lifetime working in television that saw her recently appear as the Duchess of Buccleuch in ITV's Victoria. For all her many credits, though, she does not tend to watch herself on screen. ""Been there, done that, all of it,"" she says. ""Dredging up the past is not my style. I prefer to move on.""

"Government schemes so far have proved ""inadequate and patchy at best"", its general secretary and president said. ""Creative workers need action now,"" they wrote, adding that many were ""struggling to stay afloat"". A government spokesperson pointed to its ""generous"" support including the the £1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund. In their letter, Paul W Fleming and Maureen Beattie wrote: ""The reality for most of our members, including thousands of people who regularly work throughout the community in care homes or delivering theatre in education, is that there is no route back to work any time soon. ""With this crisis certain to last for months to come, our members will soon pass the year's mark since our industry's closure - a year without regular, reliable income for the vast majority of our membership."" Equity represents actors and other ""creative practitioners"". Four out of 10 could not access the Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS), Equity said. It added that freelancers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had received some additional support, but ""those in England have not received any further help"". In response, the government spokesperson said the SEISS was ""one of the most generous in the world"" and that it had ""provided billions in support to the UK's world-class cultural sector"", including the Culture Recovery Fund and the £500m film and TV insurance scheme. ""At the upcoming Budget we'll outline the next stages of our Plan for Jobs to support businesses and families across the UK,"" they added. In July, Equity welcomed the support from the Culture Recovery Fund Equity but its previous general secretary, Christine Payne, said it was important that the funding didn't just prop up venues. Meanwhile, Manchester City Council has decided to launch its own hardship fund for arts freelancers in the city, using £500,000 from retailer B&M and The Savannah Wisdom Foundation. ""Manchester's arts and culture sector contribute massively to city life and to its economy and have an important part to play in the city's recovery from the pandemic,"" councillor Luthfur Rahman said. ""We're fully committed to continuing to do everything we can to support it now and in the future."" According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, three-quarters of arts, entertainment and recreation businesses said their turnovers in the second half of December were lower than usual - the joint highest of any sector, along with accommodation and food services. And half of arts, entertainment and recreation staff were on furlough - more than for any other industry. A European study has found that the continent's cultural and creative sector has been hit harder by the coronavirus crisis than every other industry except aviation, according to The Guardian.

""I'm completely speechless,"" said the 21-year-old from Cambridgeshire. ""It's a huge compliment to be recognised by the industry and the BBC in this way. ""I really didn't expect it."" ""Being amongst names like Ellie, Jessie J, Adele is just incredible because they inspire my music so much."" Smith got his big break in 2012, as the featured vocalist on Latch, by Mercury-nominated dance act Disclosure. The single spent 15 weeks in the UK top 40, peaking at number 11 - but his next song climbed even higher. La La La, a collaboration with British producer Naughty Boy, went to number one and became the fifth biggest-selling single of 2013. After releasing a solo EP last year, he officially launches his solo career next month with the single Money On My Mind, a spritely, infectious pop song about resisting the lure of record label cash. He told the BBC the song was ""about someone in the industry who offended me recently and I had to get it off my chest."" Money On My Mind has recently been added to Radio One's influential playlist. The station's head of music, George Ergatoudis said: ""Sam Smith is blessed with a distinctive mellifluous voice that imbues his lyrics with real emotion and soul. ""The public are looking for authentic artists with genuine talent and Sam more than fits the bill. He is going to enjoy huge success this year."" Smith has also been named the winner of the Critics' Choice award by the Brits, and will pick up his trophy at the ceremony on 19 February. 'Freaked out' The Sound of 2014 was compiled by a range of music industry experts, ranging from magazine editors and newspaper critics to influential bloggers, DJs and radio and TV producers. Each was asked to name their favourite three new acts - rather than the ones they thought would be commercially successful. They were free to choose performers from any country and any musical genre. Artists who had scored a UK top 20 single or album before 11 November 2012 were ineligible, as were those already well-known to the UK public - for example by featuring in the final stages of a TV talent show or already being a member of a successful band. The tips were compiled into a longlist of the top 15 artists, which was published in December, and the top five have been revealed this week. In second place was London-born pop singer Ella Eyre, with brooding R&B siren Banks taking third place. The futuristic electro-soul of Sampha came fourth and blues-rock guitarist George Ezra completed the top five. It is the first time the entire top five has been comprised of solo artists. Greg Cochrane, editor of NME.com said: ""If the top five in this year's Sound Of is anything to go by, it's going to be a strong year for innovative young solo artists. ""It's particularly exciting that four of the five are British, too. 2013 wasn't a brilliant year for UK artists translating buzz into sales, so the industry will be hoping these artists really capture music fans' imaginations."" LA pop-rock trio Haim came top of the Sound of 2013 list. Their debut album Days Are Gone beat Justin Timberlake to number one in September, and went on to sell more than 100,000 copies in the UK. Guitarist and singer Alana Haim said her advice for Smith was ""play as much as you can"" and ""get your record done"". ""After we won, a lot of things start happening really fast and we were kind of freaked out,"" she added. ""I think if we'd had more of our album finished before we won, it would have come out a little bit faster.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News When Coldplay brought the Paralympics to a close on Sunday, it also marked the end of a four-year programme of arts events known as the Cultural Olympiad. Its climax was the London 2012 Festival - 12 weeks of concerts, exhibitions and events across the country that ran alongside the summer of sport in the Olympic Park. Organisers revealed this week that 19.5 million people had taken part in the London 2012 Festival events by 31 August, with a final week of attendance figures yet to come in. The general opinion seems to be that, after a shaky start back in 2008, the Cultural Olympiad ended on a high. ""It's been a journey from things that were on a small-scale community level to this festival with nearly 20 million people involved,"" says Tony Hall, the chief executive of the Royal Opera House, who came on board to run the Cultural Olympiad in 2009. ""That is a very large-scale statement about arts and culture in this country."" The festival had an overall investment of £55 million, including lottery cash and sponsorship from ""premier partners"" BP and BT. Now organisers are beginning months of number crunching to make sure it was money well spent. ""Did they get the biggest bang for their buck? Yes, I think they did,"" says Philip Spedding, director of Arts and Business. ""It was a neat bringing together of a whole range special commissions and other events that were going on already, and marketing them as a single entity. ""That was a smart way of getting a major punch when you don't have an awful lot of money to start with."" While the Olympiad team looks at the feasibility of holding a biennial arts event, Spedding says that the private sector had a central role to play in these cash-strapped times. Organisers of any future major cultural event, he advises, should start talking to businesses ""a lot earlier than they would normally imagine doing so"". Spedding still has the original booklet about the Cultural Olympiad from 2008 and notes how few of the original ideas actually came to fruition. But he praises the efforts of the festival team, led by director Ruth Mackenzie, who took over in 2010. ""What they did do in the end was amazing and they did it incredibly quickly,"" he says. ""But you can't keep doing these things by the seat of your pants. If you want to do it again, you have to get the planning right."" The London 2012 Festival opened on 21 June with five headline events across England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Grabbing most of the headlines was The Big Concert in Stirling. Led by superstar conductor Gustavo Dudamel, it featured an orchestra of local school children, many from the Raploch council estate, who had not played an instrument as recently as four years ago. How is the event viewed 12 weeks on? ""The overall reaction to the Big Concert was positive,"" says Gregor White, a reporter for the Stirling Observer. ""It was great to see local kids getting the chance to perform on such a huge stage and receiving such an enthusiastic response."" He added: ""Though arguably an important step up for the orchestra, the Big Concert was just the latest in a whole series of steps they've taken over the past four years. ""However there were a few voices raised immediately after the concert about how 'real' a picture it presented of Raploch, and I guess the legacy question is still as open here as it is on the sporting front."" The children's orchestra has now been invited to Venezuela next year on a trip funded by music education programme El Sistema and Sistema Scotland, with support from Stirling Council. In Wales, festival events included Adain Avion - a mobile art space inside an aircraft fuselage - and the Power of the Flame, which involved young people across the whole of the country. ""The main achievement of both of these was the fact that it got people engaged with the arts who might never have got involved before,"" says Karen Price, chief arts correspondent for the Western Mail. She adds that on the theatre front, Coriolan/us from National Theatre Wales was staged in a former aircraft hangar and attracted four and five star reviews, while Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru's Welsh-language version of The Tempest (Y Storm) merged the circus with Shakespeare. ""Both productions showed that Welsh theatre is now at the forefront, really pushing boundaries and reaching out to new audiences,"" says Price. The cultural baton has now been handed to Londonderry, UK City of Culture 2013 as well as Glasgow, host city of the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and Rio de Janeiro where the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games will take place. One arts organisation that was directly involved in the London 2012 Festival was the Frieze Foundation, which curated and produced six new public art projects in east London. ""A lot of the artistic programming came with the condition that the local community was taken into account,"" says Sarah McCrory, curator of Frieze Projects. ""The local community aspect is important, but a slight criticism might be that there could have been more funding for art projects for art's sake, as it were. It would have been interesting to have a bit more scope, but it didn't restrict what we did."" Of the festival programme as a whole, McCrory was excited by the amount of activity though there were some projects ""that weren't great in terms of quality"". ""Obviously it's been really successful in terms of getting people out and about,"" she says. ""There have been some good programmes to get young people involved, whether it is apprenticeships or visits, the creative sector always needs to encourage more children, particularly from diverse ethnic backgrounds. ""When you can make a young person aware that there are good jobs in the art world, I think that's a good start."" One such project during the 2012 Festival was the Creative Jobs Programme. Run by the Royal Opera House, it gave 40 long-term unemployed young people the opportunity to undertake paid work at some of the organisations involved in the Cultural Olympiad. While the Olympiad in its early stages came in for criticism for the breadth of its ambition, there are those who see the whole concept as flawed. Professor Pavel Buchler, of Manchester School of Art, says the idea ""promotes unhelpful associations of culture with competition"". ""Unlike the Olympic Games, the Cultural Olympiad has no history or tradition and no real meaning. It is bad enough that sport, culture and broadband are conflated in the same government department. ""Such ideas as the Cultural Olympiad make matters worse by shoe-horning or black-mailing art into a propaganda role and do nothing for the recognition of art in its own right."" Not that this is likely to worry London 2012 Festival director Ruth Mackenzie as her team analyses the final figures. ""All of our partners want to know what happens next in economic and cultural terms. There's a lot of work to gather all that together,"" she says. ""The creative industries are one of the huge success stories of the UK - you give us money and look how we market ourselves and the country. Cultural tourism is one of the most important assets we have."" So has the festival, as the sport hoped to do, inspired a generation? ""What we have ensure is that we can offer every young person something to dream about,"" says Mackenzie. ""For those that can't be world-class athletes maybe the arts and creativity offers another way forward. ""Maybe they want to be Jude Law or Rihanna or Jay-Z or Gustavo Dudamel. ""Certainly every child in Raploch wants to be Gustavo Dudamel when they grow up, and that's thanks to London 2012 Festival in part.""","It boasted bell-ringers, a bouncy Stonehenge and a string quartet in helicopters.

"He's called for people to be ""compassionate"" when dealing with those who are unfamiliar with LGBT concepts. The TV presenter said he felt too many demands were placed on people to understand the different academic views on gender and sexuality. He said the LGBT community should try to help people who want to learn more about these issues. Lycett, who describes himself as pansexual, said: ""I'm loathe to call it 'my community' but I suppose it is as I am a member of it, can sometimes be guilty of expecting everyone to have done all of the reading and research that members of it have. ""Because lots of LGBTQ people are really smart, and there's so much really interesting reading that can be done, and so much academic writing that's been done about it, people can end up getting quite academic about it."" He said it's sometimes forgotten that people outside the LGBT community ""need to have it explained to them in a way that's compassionate, and is understanding that there's quite a lot to take in"". Lycett said he hoped people would treat others in the way they expected to be treated themselves. ""I did a tweet about LGBTQ+ and someone was saying 'what's the + and what's the Q?' and some people would be like 'you should educate yourself it's disgusting, google it'. ""If I asked the question, they would answer it to me, so just try and treat people in the way I expect to be treated myself. ""So I do think that's been a problem in our community."" Equalities charity Stonewall agreed it was important to have conversations about sexual orientation and gender identity in a ""respectful way to help increase understanding and acceptance for LGBT people in society"". In a statement to the BBC, they said: ""It's great that people want to better understand the right language to use when talking about LGBT people and their identities. ""Non-LGBT people who want to better support the community can start by learning about and listening to the experiences of LGBT people and the challenges we face."" The group advised: ""Getting to know more about LGBT people, our history and issues is an empowering step towards becoming an ally. ""Only by working together with allies can we create a world where no one faces violence, harassment and discrimination just because of who they are.""

"He will be remembered for his futuristic designs - some were inspired by the space age, some were even impossible to wear. He carved his own way through the fashion industry. Parisian haute couture had always been exclusive - its high priests believed it should be high-end, individually tailored and eye-wateringly expensive. Cardin broke the mould. He launched ""ready-to-wear"" collections, bringing high fashion to the middle classes. His designer peers were aghast, and threw him out of their club. In the 1950s, men wore traditional suits which made the young look like their fathers. Cardin threw out the boxy jackets and stiff white shirts, creating a revolutionary look for a new, progressive generation. Gone were the bulky details; collars, lapels, tails and cuffs. Trousers were tapered and hung loosely on the hips. In an instant, young men had their own identity; smart, sleek and nothing like their dads. The Beatles, amongst others, were quick to recognise Cardin as ""one step ahead of tomorrow"". He expanded into ladies' couture, restaurants, perfume and furniture. He established global licensing agreements that put his name on everything from ballpoint pens to fancy watches. It brought fashion down from Olympus and gave it to the masses. By 2018, the man who had once been the youngest designer in Paris had become the oldest. But even in his 90s Pierre Cardin was still putting models on catwalks, seeking new ways to capture the future before it exists. ""The clothes that I prefer are those I invent for a life that doesn't exist yet - the world of tomorrow"", he said. Destiny Pietro Cardin was born, to French wine merchants, near Treviso, Italy on 2 July 1922. He was the last of 11 children. His parents took one look at Mussolini and fled back to France. They wanted young Pierre to be an architect but, even as a child, it was clear his interests lay in fashion and design. They found themselves in Vichy, under the heel of the Nazis. Cardin learned his trade as a tailor and worked alongside the Red Cross. One day, a fortune teller read his cards and told him he would be exceptionally successful; his name known as far away as Australia. He thought she was crazy, but asked her if she knew anyone in Paris where he wanted to work for a fashion house. She gave him a name. Having nothing to lose he set off, stopped a man on the street to ask directions, only to find he was the man she had mentioned. Crazy, it might have been, but it was beginning to feel a lot like fate. He showed up at Paquin, one of France's leading fashion houses, met the legendary film director, Jean Cocteau and began working on his costumes for Beauty and the Beast. Impressed, Cocteau introduced him to Christian Dior. Creativity Within five years, Cardin was well-known enough to set up on his own. Dior helped him open a boutique, called Eve, on the rue Faubourg Saint-Honoré. He designed a bubble dress; tight at the waist, billowing at the thigh and narrow at the hem. It became an overnight, global sensation. His client list included Rita Hayworth and Eva Peron. Seeking inspiration from abroad, Cardin visited Japan and taught tailoring at their fashion schools. In 1959, his ready-to-wear collection for women at the famous Printemps department store in Paris made his fellow designers choke on their croissants. For his heresy, they expelled him from their trade association, only to invite him back when they saw his success. His relationship with the other gods of fashion in that golden age, like Yves Saint Laurent, was never easy. ""They looked down on me, you know,"" he said. ""I would invite them out, but they would never invite me back."" He opened a men's boutique, called Adam, full of the collarless jackets that Lennon and McCartney were soon to wear on stage. He gathered every triplet in Paris to launch a children's collection, continued making costumes for film and TV and fell in love with space. He found the Apollo space programme deeply inspiring. He began using new materials; vinyl, silver fabric and big zips. He moulded hats from plastic, echoing an astronaut's helmet and his dresses grew sleeves orbiting the arms, emblazoned with circle motifs in tribute to the Moon. His 1964 collection was a landmark statement for another reason. It put both men and women in tunic and hose, anticipating all later trends towards unisex dressing. He began putting his logo on all his designs, an industry standard today but something revolutionary back then. The 1970s saw him launching lines of perfume and branching into industrial design. He did the interiors of cars and the outside of aircraft, sculptural items of furniture and porcelain crockery. Commercialism A maverick in marketing as well as design, the next two decades saw Cardin move ever more into licensing. He built his brand into what became an empire, that fortune-teller's prophesy coming true. ""I've done it all,"" he told the New York Times. ""I even have my own water! I'll do perfumes, sardines. Why not? If someone asked me to do toilet paper, I'd do it"". He had hundreds of licences, employed thousands of people and made a lot of money. He was careful to say he carefully selected the products that bore his name; in reality it did dilute the brand. The former King of haute-couture now had his name on boxer shorts in Wal-Mart. Sometimes he put his ""P.C."" logo on in writing as small as he could. ""Pierre Cardin's signature is almost as common as that of the American treasury secretary"", sniffed the Economist in 1989, ""and as devalued as the dollar bills he signed."" In 2011, Cardin tried to sell the business. He wanted a billion euros although it was probably worth a fraction of that. One problem was that neither he, not indeed anybody else, had much of a clue how much he was making - it was all so dependent on the licences. He ended up never selling. In old age, he bought the Marquis de Sade's castle and created a festival of lyric art. He opened a museum in Saint-Ouen, became a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations and presented spectacular new collections in Russia and China. Of course, the once ground-breaking space-age designs of the 1960s are now museum pieces. Futuristic fashion, by definition, never lasts. But in a lifelong search for the look of tomorrow, Pierre Cardin brought cutting-edge design to the people and permanently changed the fashion industry itself. He knew he had his critics, accusing him of chasing the money to the detriment of the brand. But he would point to the fate of other famous designers who produced works of greatness but ended life with nothing. ""I don't want to die without a nickel - then 20 years after I'm dead, see others make a fortune from my name,"" he told one interviewer. ""Look at me now, I am patron, artisan, propriétaire,"" he would say, with all the sweeping self-confidence of a rich, global icon well into his 10th decade. ""Every day I work at my designs, and I control every cent.""

"Savile was one of Britain's biggest stars, a larger-than-life character who was known for tea-time TV favourites like Top of the Pops and Jim'll Fix It as well as stints on BBC Radio 1. At the same time, it has since come to light, he was exploiting his status to prey on hundreds of people - girls and boys, men and women, but mostly vulnerable young females. He assaulted and raped them in television dressing rooms, hospitals, schools, children's homes and his caravan. The scale of Savile's crimes was ""to the best of our knowledge unprecedented in the UK"", according to a report into his activities titled Giving Victims A Voice, which was published in 2013. The abuse was thought to have begun in the mid-1940s, when he was in his late teens or early twenties, and lasted until 2009, two years before his death. ""It is now clear that Savile was hiding in plain sight and using his celebrity status and fund-raising activity to gain uncontrolled access to vulnerable people across six decades,"" the Giving Victims A Voice report concluded. He was, the report said, ""a mainly opportunistic individual who used his celebrity status as a powerful tool to coerce or control them, preying on the vulnerable or star-struck for his sexual gratification"". Savile once famously claimed he had no emotions. ""That would make me bad news for a psychiatrist or a psychologist because there's nothing to find,"" he told Dr Anthony Clare in BBC Radio's In the Psychiatrist's Chair in 1991. ""What you see is what there is."" But that was the carefully constructed Savile myth. It ensured very few people ever really got close to him, or knew the truth about what made him tick. The public persona portrayed him as eccentric and flamboyant, but essentially straightforward and good-natured. The mask rarely slipped while he was alive, and it helped him deflect accusations of anything more sinister. He would attract speculation because he was odd, he would say - but that was all he was. ""It's a nice thing that I have nothing to hide from people,"" he told a documentary titled The World of Jimmy Savile OBE in 1972. ""They ask me, are you queer? I say no, but if I felt that way I would have been. They ask me, why don't you get married? I say, well I've never felt the need. ""I've got nothing to hide from people, and when you come to think about it I lead a dead simple sort of life, which is OK, and definitely enough for me."" But in one rare moment of candour, he was asked by the interviewer Louis Theroux in 2000 why he had said he had no emotions. ""'Cause it's easier,"" he replied. ""You say you've got loads and then you've got to explain them for two hours. The truth is that I'm very good at masking them."" Savile, one of seven children and the son of a bookmakers' clerk, had survived serious spinal injuries while working in a coal mine as a teenager before becoming a dance hall DJ and manager after World War II. His clubs included Mecca Locarno club in Leeds in the early 1960s. Post-war austerity was being blown away and Savile claimed to be the first person to DJ with two turntables so there were no breaks between records. Bouncer Dennis Lemmon later recalled how Savile arrived at the club in a bad mood one day. A colleague told Mr Lemmon that Savile was due in court the following day after ""messing about with a couple of girls"". When Mr Lemmon later asked how the case had turned out, his colleague told him: ""It never got to court - they dropped the charges."" ""I said 'How the hell did he wangle that one?'"" Mr Lemmon continued. ""He said 'He did what he did last time - he paid them off.'"" So how did he get away with it? ""He was a very powerful man, wasn't he?"" Mr Lemmon replied. ""A very powerful man with a lot of influence."" Even at the start of his career, his forceful personality was fully formed and he claimed to have the muscle to back it up. Savile told Louis Theroux that during his club days, he ""invented zero tolerance"" and was ""judge, jury and executioner"" when he locked troublemakers in the club basement. The aura remained as Savile became more famous and influential. He later cultivated friendships with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Prince Charles. It is not difficult to see how a young victim could have believed that his or her word may have counted for less than his. 'Open secret' After the clubs, the tracksuit-wearing, platinum-haired showman went on to become a familiar presence, weighed down with jewellery and with cigar in hand. Figures from the music industry and TV world have said they heard rumours about Savile's behaviour. Roger Holt, a former record plugger who would visit the Radio 1 offices every week in the 1960s, said Savile's predilection for young girls was ""an open secret"". ""I heard through his office, just in conversation, 'Jimmy's at it again,'"" he said. ""He used to travel the country with his colleagues at the BBC [who would say] 'Oh he gets these young girls in his Rolls or the caravan when he was travelling around.' ""They'd just say 'Oh he's after these young girls.' It was an open secret in the record industry."" Savile would not socialise like other DJs, Mr Holt recalled. ""He was just a very strange person. You couldn't really have a conversation with him. I used to see him at Top of the Pops and didn't talk to him unless I had to go to his dressing room. ""When I had to go to his dressing room the last time I was there, there weren't any young girls in there - there were a lot of his mates who I thought were as weird as he was. There was definitely a clique in that dressing room."" Some suspicions centred on Savile's activities in the caravan he took on the road with a Radio 1 show called Savile's Travels. In 1973, Radio 1 controller Douglas Muggeridge asked the station's press officer Rodney Collins to check whether any newspapers were planning to print rumours about his exploits. ""There were allegations that there were girls, under-age girls involved, maybe, in the caravan,"" Mr Collins told the BBC. He reported back that the papers had ""heard these allegations"" but were unwilling to print them ""whether they were true or not"" because Savile did a lot for charity and was ""perceived as a very popular man"". Savile persuaded the tabloids not to run stories by telling them they would be responsible for the end of his charity fund-raising. Savile was said to have raised £40m for charities and it was an effective form of emotional blackmail. His fund-raising activities also gave him a way to get into hospitals, schools and the corridors of power. He had a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville hospital in Buckinghamshire, where his now-defunct charitable trust was based, as well as an office and living quarters at Broadmoor psychiatric hospital in Berkshire. In 1988, he was even appointed by the Department of Health as the head of a taskforce overseeing Broadmoor. Eleven allegations of sexual abuse at Broadmoor were reported to a review that was published in June 2014, but this is thought to be an underestimate. The review also recounted how he watched and made inappropriate comments when female patients stripped and showered naked in front of staff. 'Unwholesome' interests Dr Chandra Ghosh, a former consultant psychiatrist at Broadmoor, told the BBC's Panorama that the victims were highly vulnerable. ""These were people that nobody believed,"" she said. ""So if they had in fact turned around and said that he had abused them or raped them, nobody would have believed them."" Savile was also a regular visitor to Leeds General Infirmary, where at least 60 people have come forward to say they were abused. They were aged between five and 75 at the time. A total of 44 reports into Savile's activities in relation to specific hospitals and hospice premises have also been published. Stoke Mandeville Hospital was one of those concerned and a report published in February 2015 found Savile had full and unsupervised access to all areas of the hospital for more than 20 years. It described Savile as an ""opportunistic predator"" who abused more than 60 victims between 1968-92. Dr Sue Proctor, who chaired an inquiry into Savile's actions at Leeds General Infirmary, said the star also had an ""unwholesome interest in the dead"". It is alleged he posed for photographs and performed sex acts on corpses in the hospital mortuary. She also referred to Savile's claims that large rings he wore were ""made from the glass eyes of dead bodies at the mortuary"". 'Very naive' For Savile's friends and acquaintances who had no inkling of his darker side and only remembered his acts of charity, all this has been hard to come to terms with. Roger Ordish, producer of Jim'll Fix It, which ran between 1975 and '94, said he never suspected any wrongdoing. When Savile stayed at the Ordish family home one night, they put him in a bedroom next to their 14-year-old daughter. ""We, in our innocence, had no idea,"" Roger Ordish's wife Susie said, speaking in October 2012. Mrs Ordish said she thought Savile treated every woman the same way - ""a very unsophisticated, naive, clumsy way"". ""He would kiss every woman's hand. He thought he was being gallant. It wasn't gallant. It wasn't seedy. It was just very naive,"" she said. ""Because of his clumsiness with women, which was not in the least sexual, I thought he was one of those asexual people."" One of Savile's tactics for keeping his friends in the dark about his private life was to keep them apart. Many fellow DJs, with whom he worked on BBC Radio 1 for decades, admitted they barely knew the man at all. But he had a separate set of friends in his home city of Leeds, with whom he would go running or have weekly meals in the Flying Pizza restaurant. As well as Leeds, he had homes in Scarborough, London, Scotland and Bournemouth and had different groups of friends in different places. They were his ""teams"", he called them. In Scarborough, Louis Theroux was let into the flat where Savile's mother had lived, and discovered Savile's continuing attachment to her, 27 years after her death. Savile kept clothes belonging to his mother - whom he dubbed The Duchess - in her wardrobe, just as they had been when she had died. After that documentary, the view many held of Savile shifted from odd to creepy. One key element of the public Savile persona was that, despite hosting children's TV shows, he hated children. Theroux again managed to get Savile to open up when he asked the star why he insisted that he hated youngsters. ""We live in a very funny world and it's easier for me as a single man to say I don't like children because that puts a lot of salacious tabloid people off the hunt,"" he replied. Was that because such a reply would stop questions about whether or not he was a paedophile, Theroux asked? ""How do they know whether I am or not?"" Savile said. ""How does anybody know whether I am? ""Nobody knows whether I am or not. I know I'm not, and I can tell you from experience that the easy way of doing it, when they say, all them children on Jim'll Fix It, is to say, yeah, I hate them. ""That's my policy. That's the way it goes. And it's worked a dream. A dream."" Police forces did have chances to take Savile to court while he was alive - but no charges were ever brought. Legal threats In 2009, the Crown Prosecution Service looked at four allegations dating back to 1970, but decided not to pursue a case because the victims would not support police action. Savile was interviewed under caution and said the allegations had been invented by the complainants, who he claimed were after money. He threatened to take legal action against the police and mentioned that he had sued five newspapers in the past. Savile was also named during a 2008 police investigation into abuse at Haut de Garenne children's home in Jersey. But the truth did not come out until after his death. ""As a nation, at that time we held Savile in our affection as a somewhat eccentric national treasure with a strong commitment to charitable causes,"" Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in June 2014. ""In reality he was a sickening and prolific sexual abuser who repeatedly exploited the trust of a nation for his own vile purposes.""","In his lifetime, millions knew Jimmy Savile as an eccentric TV personality. To some, he was Saint Jimmy, who raised £40m for charity. But it has transpired that he was also one of the UK's most prolific sexual predators."

It opened in March last year, by which time it had already had more than 45,600 tickets booked through advance sales. It was the most successful pre-opening exhibition since 2007's The First Emperor: China's Terracotta Army. Pompeii also featured the first live cinema event produced by the museum, which offered an exclusive private view of the exhibition. It was shown in 281 venues across the UK and was seen by 53,885 cinema-goers including more than 13,600 school children. It has since been shown as a recording internationally to more than 1,000 cinemas across 51 countries worldwide, with an audience of more than 36,000. 'Global citizenship' The museum's director, Neil MacGregor, said: ""I am delighted that so many people have visited the world collection at the British Museum in the last year. ""Displays onsite, loans and touring exhibitions nationally and internationally, big screen viewings and online access mean this is truly a dynamic collection that belongs to and is used by a global citizenship"". Pompeii was also the third-most popular exhibition in the museum's history, with Tutankhamun getting 1.6 million visitors in 1972 and the Terracotta Army getting 850,000. Shunga: Sex and pleasure in Japanese art attracted 87,893 visitors in three months by the time it closed in January 2014, while Ice Age Art closed in June with more than 90,000 visitors - a 133% increase on its target of 40,000. The museum is also to screen Vikings Live in more than 340 UK cinemas on 24 April 2014 and a pre-recorded cinema event for schools, Vikings Adventures, will be screened in June.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News Boyle's Frankenstein will run from 5 February at the National Theatre with Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the lead roles of Frankenstein and the Monster. ""I can't wait for the collaboration to begin,"" Cumberbatch told the BBC. ""I hope people get a lot of thrills and spills."" The new play has been adapted by Nick Dear from Mary Shelley's Gothic horror story, first published in 1818. Asked how he felt about taking on he dual role, Cumberbatch said: ""Pretty terrified, actually. I'm in a sort of fearless place, but I know the risks involved and it's quite a huge undertaking. ""But Danny has this ridiculously endless pool of energy which is constantly reinventive. If you look at his roster of work, it's so varied and extraordinary that I couldn't be in safer hands."" The star of TV's Sherlock said he was looking forward to working again at the National having appeared in Terence Rattigan's After the Dance in the summer. ""We hope it will have a life on Broadway at some point. It would be a great thing for an American audience to see,"" he said. Box office pull Cumberbatch has also been filming Steven Spielberg's War Horse, and is currently working on Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Both films are due out in 2011. He will film a new series of Sherlock in the summer, with Martin Freeman reprising his role as Dr Watson. Miller is best known for playing Sick Boy in Oscar winner Boyle's 1996 film Trainspotting. His stage work includes After Miss Julie and Festen. He was recently seen in the BBC's adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. ""He's an extraordinary actor,"" Cumberbatch said. ""It's going to be a really exciting rehearsal process. It's going to be quite mad because we're doing it side-by-side."" The 34-year-old actor added: ""I imagine the box office pull of Danny Boyle and the story itself - and maybe Jonny and myself - is going to mean that ticket sales will be quite high. ""And I did play quite a famous detective for three nights in the summer which has seemed to have transformed things around me a little bit, and if that helps - terrific.""","Actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is due to begin rehearsals for a stage version of Frankenstein, says he feels in safe hands with Danny Boyle at the helm."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter Greg Palfrey is a Southampton man. He went to university in the city, then stayed in town and trained there as an auditor before deciding to specialise in insolvency… in Southampton, of course. He is still there today, more than 30 years later, heading up the Restructuring and Recovery department at Smith & Williamson, the firm of administrators overseeing the sale of the Nuffield Southampton Theatres' (NST) assets. It was he who struck a sympathetic tone for his highly regarded local theatre, saying it had: ""In line with other performance venues, suddenly found itself with unprecedented pressure on cash flow in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak - a flood of refund requests and little in the way of advanced bookings."" Palfrey's expert analysis of the situation was picked up by the press. The Guardian wrote: ""Nuffield Southampton Theatres (NST) has gone into administration as a result of the increasingly severe financial impact caused by coronavirus"". The Stage newspaper tweeted: ""Nuffield Southampton Theatres has gone into administration due to the Covid-19 crisis, with administrators branding it 'a sad day not only for Southampton […] but for the country's theatreland in general'. That elicited this tweet from the playwright James Graham: ""So sad & senseless. A theatre loved locally, well attended, but ticket refunds due to the necessary shutdown means it has no cash and no sign of a cash injection from government."" It was clear then, the bug was to blame. Fine. Except, there was one small problem. It wasn't true. Coronavirus didn't cause the multi award-winning Nuffield Southampton Theatres to go bust. It had almost nothing to do with it. The highly respected NST, which was voted Regional Theatre of the Year 2015 and had only recently moved into a brand new £30 million city-centre venue, went bust because Arts Council England (ACE) withdrew all its funding - hundreds of thousands of pounds of which was overdue - at very short notice in the middle of the lockdown. It was a brutal, mortal blow at a time of unprecedented hardship for the theatre sector delivered by a tax-payer and lottery-funded quango whose sole purpose is to support the arts. Why, you may wonder, would it do that? Particularly as ACE had recently allocated an extra £90 million to provide short-term help to struggling arts companies it subsidises, of which £57 million remains unspent. 'Running close to break-even' NST employees were left bemused and confused. ACE's actions would cause all 86 of them to lose their jobs when alternative theatre work is practically non-existent. Small producers and freelances have been left out of pocket, and nearly-new theatre equipment - paid for from the public purse - is being sold off to go towards the costs of the recovery for creditors and the administration process. To put the theatre and its staff in this catastrophic situation one must assume that something very, very bad had gone wrong. Not according to Greg Palfrey. His firm was asked by the NST's board to provide an independent review of its finances in April 2020. Palfrey and his team couldn't see too much to be worried about, as is evident in Smith & Williamson's Joint Administrators' Report published 26 June 2020. It shows there was well over £400,000 in theatre's bank account, the business was ""running close to break-even"" for the financial year despite the arrival of Covid-19, and many of the teething problems of moving into the new building had been overcome. The only major problem it identified was Arts Council England, which was in arrears with its quarterly payment of around £280,000. Beyond that, Palfrey concluded no additional funding was required at that stage, and ""the Company could continue on a solvent basis"". ACE received Smith & Williamson's report in April, compared it to an earlier independent financial review that was more negative, took stock, and then pulled the plug on the theatre on 1 May. It said it had lost faith in the management and the board and had ""a duty to invest public money responsibly"" and couldn't ""continue to invest money where it will only end up mitigating debts and does not clearly demonstrate a benefit to the public"". To many at the theatre, including senior staff, this came as a nasty surprise - although most were aware that the NST had had a bad year in 2018 when it moved into its new building. Having previously run a largely profitable enterprise (NB: profitable only because it is subsidised), which had a planned and agreed loss in 2017 due to problems with the new building, it found the first year in what was now called the NST City Theatre very challenging. Although it had cost £30 million to build, it was not fit-for-purpose when the keys were handed over by the building's owners Southampton City Council, who had contributed around £20 million towards its creation, with another £7.2 million coming from ACE. The new theatre was on the second floor above a Nando's, which would have been fine if the customer lift worked, but it didn't, making the theatre inaccessible to many people, and off-putting for potential clients who might want to hire the space for events. The goods lift at the back didn't work either, causing costly and cumbersome scenery removals in and out of the building. Added to which, the café franchisee, who was an important part of the original business plan, pulled out. Such teething problems are not unusual in new buildings, but the difficulties didn't stop there. A production of Peter Morgan's The Audience didn't do as well at the box office as had been hoped, and production costs nearly doubled as Sam Hodges, the long-standing, award-wining Artistic Director and CEO, got to grips with producing shows for the new theatre as well as the original much-loved 1960s Nuffield Campus Theatre at the University of Southampton. By the end of its financial year, NST had spent all its reserves (a crucial buffer that all theatres need to maintain in order to satisfy the accountants) and filed a £507,000 loss. This, not unreasonably, gave ACE significant cause for concern. It could, though, perhaps find some comfort knowing it was partly caused by issues with the new building (NST lost £107,000 the previous year, but this was planned for and agreed by all parties) and it backed Hodges and his team, who had a track-record of running a surplus budget. There were other areas of reassurance, too. NST was delivering an artistic programme that was respected nationally and popular with local theatre-goers (box office records were broken in 2018 and 2019), critics (Billionaire Boy: The Musical was the 2019 UK Theatre winner Best Show for Children and Young People), and ACE. It was also doing good work in the community and nurturing local theatre-makers such as Zoie Logic, about whom Darren Henley, the CEO of ACE, enthusiastically tweeted on 27 September 2019: ""Inspirational afternoon with brilliant ACE-supported @zoielogic in Southampton"". The financial difficulties of 2018 were bad but not wholly exceptional for a producing theatre establishing a new business model. It was, for the first time in its history running two venues: The old campus theatre and the new city centre space. ACE had supported the expansion by nearly doubling its annual grant to the NST from £553,000 to £974,000 in 2015. The Arts Council was also used to helping theatre companies when they encountered choppy waters. In the recent past both the English National Opera and Liverpool Everyman Theatre were given significant support in their times of financial trouble, where artistic ambition had exceeded financial realities. In crisis? ACE didn't pull the rug from under either of those two institutions, both of which it helped through a period of re-building management teams and board members, even though the two organisations were in breach of the terms and conditions of their funding agreement in relation to financial viability. So why did the Arts Council go to the apocalyptic lengths of effectively bankrupting the NST citing a loss faith in a management team led by someone it had repeatedly backed and a board with a new Chair? The answer is not clear. ACE said the theatre was ""in crisis for some time"", but published accounts and the responses to its artistic programme suggest a difficult year in 2018 rather than historic mismanagement. ACE asserts the NST didn't offer an alternative business plan. The NST disputes this, saying that there were several iterations of a business plan put forward - and claim they were told by ACE, as recently as autumn 2019, that the business was going in the right direction. ACE says the NST was going to lose over £100,000 in the financial year to March 2020, when, in fact, it lost £17,000. ACE said it asked for new management accounts that didn't materialise, the NST said they provided timely and comprehensive management accounts. ACE called for organisational review, NST says Hodges offered to step aside as CEO and leave if necessary. ACE said it had lost faith in the board, NST says the board had a new Chair who only started in June 2019 and hadn't been given the time to refresh and settle a new non-executive team. ACE says an Executive Director hired in 2019 left citing Hodges as impossible to work with. NST points out that the Executive Director never took up her full-time post, and when ACE was asked for evidence of the accusation it could not provide any beyond attributing the comment to a phone call. The list of claims and counter-claims goes on. Ultimately these things are subjective: They are about belief and projecting into the future. If ACE thought it was throwing good money after bad, it was within its rights to withdraw the remaining £1.9 million that it had committed to the NST (the money has been ring-fenced by ACE for future arts activity in Southampton). But questions remain. Why did ACE allow the perception to persist that the NST went bust due to Covid-19 when it knew perfectly well that wasn't the case? Why could it not find a way to support a management that had long delivered a respected artistic programme? And, why not allow the NST the same time and space afforded to the Liverpool Everyman and English National Opera to put its house in order? Note: This would have required the theatre to opt out of being an ACE ""National Portfolio Organisation"", while the quango helped the business back onto its feet. The NST Board began this process by applying to leave the NPO, a request that was accepted by ACE on condition of an independent review of its finances. The review happened, the Board didn't agree with some of its assumptions (EG that the NST would lose over £100,000 in the financial year) and invited Smith & Williamson to conduct a review, which concluded the business was in a fit state to continue to operate as a ""going concern"". ACE took a different view, and deemed the theatre's position as ""irrecoverable"". Were there other factors that might have influenced ACE's decision? Possibly. ACE increased its funding to the NST in 2015 because it was expanding to run two venues. But last year, the University of Southampton, which owns the Sir Basil Spence-designed Nuffield Theatre Campus, gave notice that it was taking back the building's lease. This meant that from April 2020 - a month before ACE withdrew funding - the NST would only be running one venue: The new city centre theatre above Nando's. Might ACE have been tempted to ask for half its money back? Yes. Did it? No. Are those theatre operators to whom the Arts Council is currently talking about taking over the space being offered the full amount in subsidy or the reduced sum? That will become apparent in due course. The decision by the University of Southampton to take back its lease changed the ecology of the theatre scene in the city, which includes the much bigger Mayflower Theatre. Did ACE see an opportunity to consolidate the one-venue NST into a ""Southampton Theatres"" offer, which might involve a partnership with the commercial Mayflower, perhaps alongside the university's refurbished Nuffield Campus Theatre? Maybe that would allow it to invest its £1.9 million differently, focussing on up-and-coming theatre groups like Zoie Logic? This is all speculation, but it might offer a rationale as to why ACE and Southampton City Council (SCC) chose to rebuff three offers to buy the existing NST in early July, and thereby save it from going bust and potentially its staff from losing their jobs. Smith & Williamson had put forward what it considered to be three serious bidders to ACE and SCC, which had been whittled down from more than 30 potentially interested parties, but all were sent packing for not fulfilling their criteria. A disappointed Greg Palfrey said ""we did everything we could to keep NST alive"" but now he had to go into immediate closure and asset sale mode as from 2 July. That meant the staff had to go, leading to this tweet from James Graham: ""Southampton Nuffield Theatre is closing for good. 60 yrs of investment, training & serving its community. All profitable in normal times, just needed shortfall funding while closed & it didn't come in time. So sorry to the 86 made redundant, & the locals who loved their theatre"". The truth is, there was the money, and that's even before taking into consideration the £57 million of emergency funding not used by ACE. The staff lost their jobs because ACE decided to stop funding the theatre. Maybe it was a pre-determined decision, maybe it will be for the best, maybe it was the right thing to do at the right time. Maybe. But when you look at the data: The published accounts, the published report by Smith & Williamson, the artistic record of Hodges and his team, it is understandable that the people who worked at the NST question why ACE took such a drastic step, delivering a fatal blow to the theatre and their livelihoods during a global pandemic before all other avenues had been fully exhausted, such as the NST coming out of the NPO, or a working towards a change in management. Was there really no other option? The good news is the Arts Council and Southampton City Council are committed to keeping the new building as a theatre. They are currently in discussions with potential operators with an announcement expected very soon. Sadly, it will be too late for the 86 people Smith & Williamson are making redundant in order to bring the final curtain down on the decades old Nuffield Southampton Theatres Trust.

"Amazing Grace was shot by director Sydney Pollack in 1972, but it spent decades in an unedited form. Years of legal complications followed, and now it will finally debut at the DOC NYC festival on 12 November, with the support of the singer's estate. The ""queen of soul"" - known for hits like Respect and Think - died of cancer in August, aged 76. The film Amazing Grace was only finished in 2011 because of technical problems. After that, Franklin and her lawyers blocked the film's release repeatedly, once suing producer Alan Elliot for using her likeness without her permission. Legal clearance finally came after the singer's death, when her family members were open to seeing the film. It was filmed over two nights at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Los Angeles, when Franklin recorded her Amazing Grace album. However, Pollack - who later won an Oscar for Out of Africa - made a mistake during the 1972 recording. By not using clapper boards, an essential tool to match sound with footage in a pre-digital age, he made the 20 hours of raw film frustratingly hard to edit. The Warner Bros studio, which financed the shoot, ultimately gave up, according to the New York Times. Elliot secured the film's rights in 2007, a year before Pollack died. The producer then assembled a team, who were able to put it together using digital technology. ""Aretha's fans will be enthralled by every moment of the film as her genius, her devotion to God and her spirit are present in every frame,"" said Elliot in a statement. To qualify for the 2019 Academy Awards, the 87-minute film will run in Los Angeles and New York for one week this year. Elliot told the New York Times a wider release would likely take place in January, potentially coinciding with the birthday of civil rights leader Martin Luther King. ""Amazing Grace is the heart and soul of Aretha Franklin,"" the singer's niece and estate's executor Sabrina Owens told media on Monday. ""Her fans need to see this film, which is so pure and joyous."" Franklin won 18 Grammys and had 17 Top Ten US chart hits over a music career spanning seven decades.",A long-awaited Aretha Franklin documentary will premiere in New York City - 46 years after being filmed.
"The track shares the honour with Clean Bandit's Rather Be, according to the Official Charts Company. Mike Read's UKIP Calypso finished just outside the top 40, at number 44. Earlier this week, the former BBC Radio DJ ""apologised unreservedly"" and asked for the song to be withdrawn following complaints that it was racist. UKIP Calypso, performed with a mock Caribbean accent, sings the praises of party leader Nigel Farage. ""I am so sorry that the song unintentionally caused offence,"" Read said. ""I have told the record company to withdraw the single immediately."" In the top 10, Ed Sheeran's Thinking Out Loud climbed two places to number two. The song, which has spent 18 weeks in the chart, also broke the million streams mark this week with more than 1.2 million streams. Waze & Odyssey's Bump & Grind 2014 was the highest new entry, at number three. Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's Bang Bang lies at number four and Taylor Swift's Shake It Off completes the top five.

During the recording with Herring, in front of a live audience at the central London theatre, Fry said it was the first time he had said in public that he is ""not always happy"".

Fry revealed the incident took place in a hotel room, adding the mixture of drugs and alcohol ""made my body convulse so much that I broke four ribs"". ""It was a close-run thing,"" he said. ""Fortunately, the producer I was filming with at the time came into the hotel room and I was found in a sort of unconscious state and taken back to England and looked after."" Fry told the audience that in light of his role as president of the mental health charity, Mind, he wanted to be open about his feelings.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Break My Stride, a perky pop smash from 1983 is suddenly a big deal on TikTok, the social media app where users share short, quirky videos of themselves lip-syncing, cooking or just being silly. No-one's sure how the song, a one-hit-wonder from the era of Manic Miner and The A-Team, went viral. But it has. Thousands of users have shared the song, and compilations of the clips are racking up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. Here's how it works: You text someone the lyrics to Break My Stride, one line at a time, until they figure out what's going on; then you film yourself dancing in front of the text chain. It sounds ridiculous - it is ridiculous - but the results are often hilarious. Teachers have been pranked by their pupils, and cheating boyfriends have met their comeuppance. One user sent the lyrics to a man who'd been lurking in her DMs. Other recipients simply recognise the song and join in the fun. Compilations of the clips have been watched more than 100,000 times on YouTube. This has all come as a surprise to Matthew Wilder, who wrote and recorded the song 37 years ago. ""I'm astonished and I'm thrilled,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's that simple."" It was his brother who first alerted him to the trend, about two weeks ago. ""He's got these Google alerts that pop up, so he forwarded one to me,"" says the musician. ""I looked at it and shrugged and didn't really think much of it. But then the messages started flowing in more and more frequently and I began to realise a phenomenon was beginning to occur."" The singer says Break My Stride has been played more than 62 million times on TikTok; and the influence is spreading. The track has recently popped up on Spotify's Viral 50 and Apple Music's Top 100 charts around the world, giving it a whole new lease of life. ""It's very difficult for me to keep up,"" says the 67-year-old, who's been working with Sony Music's legacy team to ""help me navigate"" the song's sudden resurgence. That led to him setting up his own TikTok account to interact with fans, and posting his own version of the meme (while wrapped in a duvet). Meanwhile, a YouTube video depicting the song's lyrics as modern-day text messages has been hastily thrown together. Those lyrics are undoubtedly the key to the song's virality. ""Last night I had the strangest dream,"" goes the opening verse, ""I sailed away to China / In a little rowboat to find you / And you said you had to get your laundry cleaned"". Wilder says the song was actually written in frustration with his record company at the time, Arista. ""I'd been on the label for a couple of years without making any headway,"" he explains. ""There was a lot of frustration in that time of my life and Break My Stride was reflective of that."" The song's chorus, ""Ain't nobody gonna break my stride / Nobody gonna slow me down,"" is widely believed to have been directed at Arista's boss, Clive Davis, who, when he heard it, sent Wilder a memo stating: ""Interesting song, but not a hit"". In turn, the singer asked to be released from his contract, and took the song to Epic Records, where it became a worldwide hit, reaching number four in the UK and five in the US. Did it feel like he'd proved Arista wrong? ""It seems so,"" laughs the singer. ""It seems to come back and prove them wrong over and over again."" However, he's reluctant to explain the references to China and dirty laundry, saying: ""To get deeper into the specifics would be a wrecking ball for people who've found a whole other way of interpreting the song."" Instead, he says, the song connects because of its ""spirit of defiance"". ""It speaks globally to the human condition of frustration. That, coupled with the quirkiness of the melody and the groove. Everything about it is just a little bit left of centre."" In the end, Break My Stride turned out to be Wilder's only significant hit; but that's not the end of his story. He's won Grammy nominations for his work on the Disney animation Mulan, and as the producer of No Doubt's breakout album Tragic Kingdom. ""That was a tough record to make,"" he recalls. ""It took us a year-and-a-half."" It's no secret that songs like Don't Speak and Happy Now were inspired by singer Gwen Stefani's painful break-up with the band's bassist Tony Kanal. Less well-known is the fact that her brother, Eric, who had been the chief songwriter, quit mid-way through the recording sessions to become an animator on The Simpsons, leaving Stefani to pick up the reins. ""There was a lot of controversy,"" says Wilder. ""The band I knew when I first met them and the band they became... they went through a sizeable evolution. ""But half-way through the making of the record was when tunes like Don't Speak and Just A Girl started to reveal themselves, because Gwen was taking on more responsibility and having more of a voice. There was a real shift."" 'Thrilled' By coincidence, all three of Wilder's most successful projects are back in the spotlight this year. As Break My Stride catches fire, Disney is gearing up to release a live-action version of Mulan, with Wilder's song Reflection due to ""play a big role"" in the movie. Meanwhile, No Doubt have hinted at plans for a 25th anniversary tour of Tragic Kingdom. The singer is watching all of this unfold from Europe where he's following his son, an operatic tenor, on tour with the Orfeo orchestra. And he couldn't be happier to see his work reach a new audience. ""The fact that all these things have such a long life and are able to come back and be appreciated again and again, speaks to the depths of what we were capable of doing. ""I'm thrilled. To go beyond that would be overstating or repeating myself, but I'm thrilled."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter Now the Conners are coming back, more than 20 years after the last episode of Roseanne was aired. All the original cast are returning - after getting up to some successful and surprising stuff in the intervening two decades. Roseanne Barr In another reality, instead of President Trump, we might now be talking about President Barr. In 2012, the real Roseanne ran for president. She didn't get very near the White House, though - she failed to gain the presidential nomination for the Green Party and ended up running for the Peace and Freedom Party, gaining 67,000 votes. As well as that, she's had her own talk show, done stand-up comedy, judged Last Comic Standing, hosted Momsters: When Moms Go Bad and starred in the reality show Roseanne's Nuts, about her macadamia nut farm in Hawaii. And in 2015, she revealed she has macular degeneration and glaucoma, saying at the time her vision was ""closing in now"". John Goodman Goodman was brilliant as Roseanne's husband Dan and he's remained one of America's best-loved actors, plying his trade in films like The Big Lebowski, The Flintstones, 10 Cloverfield Lane and Kong: Skull Island. On TV, he's starred in political comedy Alpha House and middle-age coming-out sitcom Normal, Ohio - and reunited with Barr for a pilot of a sitcom called Downwardly Mobile in 2012. But it was never made into a series. That same year he spoke about a 30-year battle with alcoholism, telling the Guardian: ""It was becoming more and more debilitating. It was life or death. It was time to stop."" Laurie Metcalf Metcalf found fame as Roseanne's little sister Jackie, but has certainly stepped out of her on-screen big sister's shadow. She's had Emmy nominations for guest spots in 3rd Rock from the Sun, Monk and Desperate Housewives - and in 2016 got a hat-trick of Emmy nominations in a single year, for Getting On, Big Bang Theory and Horace and Pete. On stage, she's had four Tony Award nominations for her appearances on Broadway - including for Misery in 2016 and A Doll's House, Part 2 this year. Sara Gilbert Gilbert, who played sardonic younger daughter Darlene, is now a co-host and executive producer of CBS talk show The Talk. She hosts with Sharon Osbourne, Aisha Tyler (both pictured), Sheryl Underwood and Julie Chen - who shared the Daytime Emmy Award for outstanding entertainment talk show host last month. She's also had parts in The Big Bang Theory, Twins, The Class and ER and has published a book called The Imperfect Environmentalist, A Practical Guide to Clearing Your Body, Detoxing Your Home, and Saving the Earth (Without Losing Your Mind). She's married to hit songwriter and one quarter of Four Non Blondes Linda Perry, and recently got together with John Goodman to give us a taste of what a Roseanne reunion might look like. Michael Fishman DJ - Roseanne and Dan's son - is all grown up. Fishman, who started out in Roseanne at the age of six, went back to high school to study performing arts and technical theatre craft. He continued to have small roles in TV shows and films, and became a co-host on Barr's talk show. His Facebook biog says: ""In recent years Michael has continued his pursuit of acting while gaining technical acclaim with an eye toward producing and directing."" Lecy Goranson Lecy Goranson played older daughter Becky for five seasons until she went to college, after which Sarah Chalke took over the role. However, Goranson returned, on and off, towards the end of the show's life. Goranson will play Becky in the reboot. However, in a nice touch, ABC says Chalke will also appear, but in ""another role"". Since Roseanne, the actress has had small parts in films like Hilary Swank's Oscar winner Boys Don't Cry and guest starred in TV shows including Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Sex and the City. Johnny Galecki Not many people have had major parts in two of the biggest sitcoms in American TV history. But Galecki, who appeared as Darlene's boyfriend-then-husband David Healy in Roseanne, went on to (and still does) play Leonard in The Big Bang Theory. In between, he played Mark Corrigan in the (terrible looking) pilot for an American version of British comedy Peep Show. Reports say he's expected to return to Roseanne in some way - although this hasn't been confirmed by ABC. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"The former child star said she felt ""honoured"" to follow in the footsteps of Pete Townshend and Billy Bragg. The lecture on 14 October, named after broadcaster John Peel, will air later that night on the digital station. Church will also be interviewed by DJ Lauren Laverne for a special edition of Weekend Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4. ""Music is a big part of part of my life,"" said Church. ""I've had some interesting times during the past 15 years, facing the same problems that many other women face when trying to forge their way in the music and entertainment worlds. ""I'm looking forward to encouraging a healthy debate around this important topic."" This is the third year that the BBC Radio 6 Music Peel Lecture has invited a notable figure to discuss a music-related issue. The inaugural Peel Lecture was given in 2011 by The Who's Pete Townshend, exploring the implications of digital music media. Last year Billy Bragg outlined why music and radio need mavericks to keep moving forward. ""Radio 6 Music can challenge the norm, so for Charlotte to question and debate the roles held by women within the music economy encapsulates the opinionated spirit of 6 Music,"" said James Stirling, 6 Music's head of programmes. Church will also feature in a preview programme on BBC Radio 4 on 12 October, when Weekend Woman's Hour will be dedicated to exploring the role of women in music. The show, presented by 6 Music DJ Lauren Laverne, will feature live performances and hear from leading female artists, industry figures and music journalists. Church's first-hand experience of the record industry began when she found international fame as a child classical singer. She later rebranded herself as a commercial pop star whose Top 10 hits included Crazy Chick and Call My Name. 6 Music said Church, now an independent singer-songwriter, was ""eminently well-placed to offer informed perspective and insight into what happens, and what is happening, to women in the music business spotlight"". The lecture is part of the Radio Festival, which takes place between 14 and 16 October at The Lowry, Salford Quays. Hosted by broadcasters Jane Garvey, Fi Glover and XFM's Jon Holmes, it will feature talks from Radio 2's Jeremy Vine, Liam Fisher of talkSPORT, Front Row's Mark Lawson and Magic 105.4's breakfast show host Neil Fox. ""Charlotte has successfully made the transition from a classical artist at a very young age to a successful pop singer in a male dominated world,"" said Chris Burns, chair of the Radio Festival. ""I'm sure her personal views of the industry today will be thought-provoking."" The Peel Lecture will be introduced by 6 Music presenter Mary-Anne Hobbs and will be available as a free download from 12.01am on 15 October 2013. John Peel started his broadcasting career at pirate station Radio London before joining BBC Radio 1 for its 1967 launch. He was famous for championing new talent on his late-night music programme, including Pink Floyd and White Stripes. Church, a vocal critic of press intrusion into the private lives of celebrities, gave evidence at the Leveson Inquiry in 2012.",Singer Charlotte Church will tackle the role of women in the music industry when she delivers BBC Radio 6 Music's Peel Lecture next month.
"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter at the Cannes Film Festival Stormtroopers lined the steps of the Grand Theatre Lumiere as director Ron Howard and members of his cast arrived for Tuesday's screening. Solo: A Star Wars Story is the first film in the series to screen at Cannes since Revenge of the Sith in 2005. Out next week in the UK, it depicts the early days of space pirate Han Solo. Alden Ehrenreich plays the character made famous by Harrison Ford in the original Star Wars trilogy and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The 28-year-old was joined at the premiere by British actresses Emilia Clarke, Thandie Newton and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who appears in the film as a testy robot. The Fleabag star was joined at the film's beach party by her partner, the director and playwright Martin McDonagh. British actor Paul Bettany, who has a villainous role in the film, arrived with his actress wife Jennifer Connelly on his arm. Also on hand was American actor and musician Donald Glover, who plays a younger version of the Lando Calrissian character originally played by Billy Dee Williams. Tuesday's screening in Cannes followed the US premiere that took place in Hollywood last week. Speaking on Tuesday, Howard said being at Cannes with the film was important as the Star Wars saga ""speaks to the entire planet"". ""I've always been a fan of the Star Wars movies but now I realise why we see them over and over again,"" he went on. Howard took over the director's chair after Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, co-directors of The Lego Movie, left the film last year. The Apollo 13 film-maker attributed their departure to ""creative differences"" and said he had to ""take a creative leap"" to take over the film mid-production. Ehrenreich, hitherto best known for his role as a slow-witted cowboy actor in the Coen brothers' Hail, Caesar!, said the chance to step into Harrison Ford's shoes was ""beyond anything [he] could have imagined"". ""When you're signing on to something like this, you're signing on to a whole life adventure,"" he continued. More from Cannes: Woody Harrelson, meanwhile, only half-jokingly referred to playing the young Han's mentor as ""the pinnacle of his career"". ""We're really breathing some rarefied air to be in Star Wars,"" said the former Cheers star. ""I'm very psyched about it."" Reviews for Solo: A Star Wars Story have generally been favourable, though the Hollywood Reporter felt Howard ""never quite manages to launch the Millennium Falcon into hyperdrive"". Variety's critic, meanwhile, said the film ""allows for moments of real grit"" and calls its action sequences ""machine-tooled spectacles of the first order"". Set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, Solo introduces its title character as an opportunistic scavenger who dreams of starting a new life on another planet. His adventures see him meet and form a bond with a giant furry ape character named Chewbacca - ""Chewie"" for short. The film screened out of competition at this year's film festival and is therefore not eligible for the event's awards. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"By Mark SavageMusic reporter Elvis Presley Enterprises Inc is seeking to retrieve items including stage outfits, jewellery and the star's high school yearbook. It says the Westgate Las Vegas Resort and Casino is holding the items ""hostage"" as part of a dispute with the operators of an Elvis exhibition. The Graceland Presents Elvis attraction closed abruptly earlier this month. Billed as the largest exhibition of Elvis memorabilia outside his Graceland home and museum, the attraction opened last April to great fanfare. But the doors closed at the beginning of March, with The Westgate claiming the show's operators, Exhibit A Circle LLC, had defaulted on their 10-year lease. Exhibit A claimed the Westgate violated the contract first, but declined to elaborate. Elvis's estate responded by filing legal papers filed in Clark County District Court, Las Vegas, on Wednesday. It claimed it had been denied access to a security camera that allowed it to monitor its items, and asked the court to order that the memorabilia be returned. Elvis Presley Enterprises declined to comment further on the legal action, but previously said Westgate aggressively seized the valuables without a legitimate legal basis. Westgate's chief operating officer Mark Waltrip declined to discuss the case. The dispute centres on the same casino where Elvis performed several hundred shows, in the days when it was known as the Las Vegas Hilton and The International. The 28,000-square-foot exhibition featured the $1 million-a-year contract Elvis signed on a tablecloth, agreeing to perform at the casino; and the single-button black suit he wore for his first performances there. Meanwhile, it has been announced that Elvis & Nixon, a comedy about the 1970 meeting between the rock star and the US president, will debut at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York next month. Liza Johnson's film, backed by Amazon Studios, stars Michael Shannon as Elvis Presley and Kevin Spacey as Richard Nixon.",The estate of Elvis Presley is suing a Las Vegas casino-hotel in a dispute over the late singer's memorabilia.
"By Heather Chen & Grace TsoiBBC News, Westeros Sure, there were major issues with many character arcs, but it was clear the hugely popular TV show's final moments were all about its dynamic female cast. From Daenerys Targaryen to Lyanna Mormont, women took centre stage while the men took a back seat. All good things must come to an end, with the show's final episode airing in the US on 19 May and the following day in the UK. But before we bid goodbye to Game of Thrones, let's take a look back at the historic female moments that changed the history of Westeros. Warning: The night is dark and full of spoilers. If you haven't caught up with the show, it's best you look away. Otherwise, read on. Long May She Reign (fire and blood) As the saying goes: ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land."" The fandom held high hopes for Daenerys Targaryen to build and establish a new world order. But after experiencing betrayal and multiple losses, things took a dramatic turn for the grieving dragon queen. She wasted no time in destroying the capital King's Landing with dragon fire, despite the city's desperate surrender. Fan reaction to Daenerys's murder spree ranged from outrage to outright disappointment. ""What she did to civilians was [equal to] genocide and crimes against humanity,"" tweeted lawyer Lim Wei Jiet. Another fan said: ""Daenerys was the Breaker of Chains and I am disappointed in her."" Author Melissa Silverstein lamented the demise of Daenerys's character arc. ""For the entire series, she talked about her vision of leadership and how she wanted to be different from the men who came before her. But all that was thrown out the window when she spiralled into madness and destroyed King's Landing."" So Daenerys has won the Iron Throne. But at what cost? The notion of a mad dragon queen has angered many but pop culture columnist and Targaryen supporter Stephanie Wilson highlighted the ""double standards"" in the show. ""Male leaders like Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister have executed people and devised plans that led to thousands of deaths (The Battle of the Blackwater). The Baratheon brothers waged bloody wars for a shot at the throne,"" she said. ""When Daenerys acted, she was deemed mad, power-hungry and violent."" US actress, comic and writer Mindy Kaling added that she would have ""done the same"". But do heroines have to play the role of saviour all the time? Actress Emilia Clarke defended Daenerys and gave some insight into her character's mindset. ""You could call it Targaryen craziness and give it names it doesn't deserve but it's just grief, it's hurt,"" she said. ""It's so natural for a person to resort to anger and when you feel that much failure, disappointment, shame, hurt and lost love, there's only so much pain you can handle before you snap."" While show runner David Benioff said solitude drove Daenerys to the brink of madness, Bristol-based psychotherapist Michelle Briggs noted the impact of factors like psychological trauma, witnessing deaths and loss of control. ""Every time we judge a person and call him or her mad, we should also take a good look at the people and events who made them that way,"" she said. The lioness who never concerned herself with the opinions of sheep ""Queen you shall be. Until there comes another; younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear."" An eerie prophecy came true for the show's principal antagonist Cersei Lannister, who met her match and was dethroned by Daenerys Targaryen. Despite her desperate cling to power, the villainess queen ""loses control"". Actress Lena Headey summed it up. ""Cersei was always destined to be alone. She's destroyed every good alliance, connection and love in her life. And until the very last minute, she was, as ever, in denial of what was actually happening,"" she said. During her reign it was hard to determine Cersei's impact over the Seven Kingdoms. But there was always something complex about it. Stephanie Wilson thinks Cersei was also a victim of the system she was raised in. ""Cersei Lannister has harboured resentment over how the patriarchal system in Westeros has kept her from true power for so long, so on some levels, her finally becoming queen was kind of an empowering moment,"" she said. ""She's a villain to the core but as far as antagonists go, she's been on par with men on the show and deserved a title to match the power she's fought so hard for. ""But her ruthlessness and sadism still made it awkward to feel completely happy for her."" Our condolences to the original Mad Queen. There were worse ways to go and now's a better time than ever to leave Westeros before it gets madder. The Lady of Winterfell: A true survivor Survivors aren't necessarily the strongest. Often, they are the smartest. This could not be truer about Sansa, the eldest Stark daughter who lost much of her innocence after witnessing the brutal execution of her father, and learned about the tragic deaths of her mother and brothers. Trauma, in whatever shape or form, impacts us. Unfortunately for Sansa, she continued to suffer greatly at the hands of men. Controversial scenes depicting domestic abuse and her marital rape at the hands of ex-husband Ramsay Bolton drew fury from fans. But Sansa refused to be weakened. She emerged stronger and to her fans, managed to live beyond what other characters on the show have experienced. But her arc ignited heated debate among sexual assault survivors, who argued that rape should not be used ""as a plot device"" to enhance or define female characters. Media lecturer Dr Stephanie Genz from Nottingham Trent University said it underlined a ""sexist logic"". ""Women should not have to be abused and 'broken in' before they can acquire resilience or toughness,"" she told the BBC. US actress Jessica Chastain said Sansa's ""prevailing strength was solely because of her and her alone"". But despite being a fully-fledged Northern leader, opinions about the Lady of Winterfell remain divisive. Academic Dr Elizabeth Beaton thinks it could be connected to traditional concepts of masculinity and femininity. ""Male heroes are typically depicted achieving their goals through action and passivity is often perceived as weakness,"" she said. ""Sansa's understanding of power came as a survivor rather than as an aggressor."" 'Fight like a girl' Think only men triumph in battle? Think again. Jon Snow may have always been tipped as the hero but in the epic, adrenaline-filled showdown between the living and the dead, it was his little sister (cousin) Arya Stark who killed one of the show's biggest baddies. ""Fight like a girl? Yes please,"" said long-time fan Eileen Ng, who admitted she was expecting Jon to deliver the finishing blow. ""After training as an assassin for years, Arya's performance was testament to how strong and dedicated women are. She deserved every minute of that victory."" There may have been bigger men on the battlefield that night but among them was another undeniable female MVP [Most Valuable Player]. Viewers went wild and cheered for Lady Lyanna Mormont, who took down an opponent more than five times her size: a horrifying ice zombie giant. ""The tiniest warrior proved she was a bigger hero than the grown men around her,"" wrote a fan on Facebook. Blogger Ani Bundel was full of praise for 16-year-old English actress Bella Ramsay, who portrayed the feisty young leader of Bear Island. ""It was great casting on HBO's part,"" she said. ""Lyanna Mormont stole every scene and when her time was up, she was awarded a David and Goliath ending."" A female knight of the Seven Kingdoms Chivalry in the Seven Kingdoms isn't quite what you'd think. Female knights are virtually unheard of in Westeros, where misogyny and patriarchy thrive. But Brienne of Tarth and her female-centric arc proved to be a game changer in the show's final season when she received her knighthood from Kingslayer Jamie Lannister. ""Brienne has always been more deserving than other knights on the show but she wasn't knighted because she's a woman. She always deserved to become one and gender should not come in the way of it,"" said Stephanie Wilson. Blogger Chloe Ketchum described the scene as one of the show's most emotional. ""Brienne's journey has always been about accepting and staying true to yourself and seeing her buck traditional gender norms was great."" The only thing this new knight did not need however, was fixing her virginity. ""Her situation with Jamie was especially egregious,"" said Wilson. ""Strong women are entitled to emotion but the show runners clearly exploited her vulnerability to propel the plot of a man."" Red dead redemption Everybody loves a bad boy but what about a villainess? Melisandre is no antagonist but it is certainly fair to say many fans did not take kindly to her. She was, after all, responsible for the burning of a young child alive. Actress Carice van Houten even received death threats after that ghastly deed aired. ""Firstly Melisandre is a witch so you could say that she was always set up to be hated,"" remarked Singapore-based feminist writer Wenny Yeo. ""She was also definitely power-hungry and made bad mistakes but there are worse things one can do on a show like Game of Thrones."" The controversial character has since redeemed herself in the eyes of fans when she came to the aid of the North. The Red Woman's failed prophecies were soon forgotten when her fire magic lit up the Dothraki armies and wooden trenches. Her motivational pep talk with Arya Stark was even credited with winning the great war. There's no denying she wrought a lot of pain but sometimes, fickle fans are the problem. Prolific author Stephen King said he'd loved the final series, adding: ""There's been a lot of negativity about the windup, but I think it's just because people don't want ANY ending. But you know what they say: All good things..."" Let's talk about sex Game of Thrones is no stranger to criticism. Ever since its start in 2011, the show has been widely criticised for perpetuating rape, sexual violence and objectifying women - amid accusations that it panders to male audiences. ""From the unclothing of only women during many of the sex scenes to shots of naked female sex workers, the show has overwhelmingly shot its scenes through the male gaze,"" said Dr Beaton. Other critics believe the problem lies with the lack of female writers on the show, having seen only one woman director in the past eight years. But this changed with Arya Stark who brought another victory when she decided to lose her virginity, on her own terms. Fans applauded the young assassin for showcasing female empowerment. ""Arya sleeping with Gendry Baratheon was one of the least offensive sex scenes in the show's entire history,"" wrote a fan on a Facebook thread. ""It showed that it was okay and natural for young women to want to have sex."" Dr Genz added that the encounter ""was not a power move and was entirely consensual"". ""Arya's subsequent rejection of a marriage proposal from Gendry also indicated her refusal to be ""domesticated"". One small step for a young assassin, one giant leap for womankind in Westeros.

"Her first album, Frank, was at five while five tracks made the singles top 40 after a surge of record sales for the singer who was cremated on Tuesday. Back to Black's title track, at number eight, was her highest-placed single. In the US, where she won five Grammys for Back to Black, the album was at number nine in the Billboard 200. Also in the UK singles chart, Tears Dry on Their Own was at number 27, Rehab was at 29, Love is a Losing Game was at number 33 and You Know I'm No Good was at 37. HMV's Gennaro Castaldo said Winehouse's record label had needed to produce more stock to satisfy demand. ""In terms of the album sales, there was a real surge last weekend, both through downloads and people buying the CD. ""But a lot of stores then ran out of stock and they've been waiting for more to arrive which it did around Thursday.""

"The pop superstar's song God Control calls for people to ""wake up"" about the reality of gun violence in the US. The scenes in the music video recall the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, where 49 people were killed. Pulse survivor Patience Carter said she was ""truly disturbed"" by the video. The eight-minute video shows actors playing revellers being shot and lying lifeless and covered in blood in a fictional nightclub called The Globe. ""I couldn't even watch after the first 45 secs @Madonna,"" Carter wrote on Twitter. ""There are so many creative avenues that could've been taken to bring awareness to gun control. The victims of these mass shootings should always be taken into consideration. I applaud the attempt, but I am truly disturbed."" Another survivor, Brandon Wolf, wrote: ""Appreciate the message, but please remember that there are people behind the prop you're using."" The singer told CNN her response to those who had a problem with the graphic violence in the video was that ""this is what happens when people shoot"". She told People: ""Seeing the reality, and the brutality of things makes you wake up. This is really happening. This is what it looks like. Does it make you feel bad?

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter The 24-year-old was up for best new artist, and scheduled to perform with Lukas Graham - but she was still a little star-struck. ""My mum was my date - and we were both sitting there fan-girling like, 'Oh my God, that's Adele! Don't look! Don't look!'"" Ballerini, it turns out, is not the sort of person who keeps her cool when she meets an idol. ""The first time I met Carrie Underwood was at the Opry, before I had a record deal,"" she recalls. ""I was waiting backstage with a bunch of people to say hello and finally it was my turn. ""I was going to say something normal - but then I saw her and went ""Girl! You got so much sooouul!"". ""Of all the things I could have said, that's what I chose,"" she grimaces. ""It was very weird."" Awkward celebrity encounters aside, Ballerini has been living in a fairytale for the last few years. She released her debut album, The First Time, in 2015 and watched its first three singles go to number one on Billboard's country airplay chart - an historic achievement for a female artist. The bubbly, vivacious melodies and autobiographical lyrics of Love Me Like You Mean It and Peter Pan won comparisons to Taylor Swift, who quickly befriended the artist (she calls Ballerini her ""little sis"") and invited her onto her 1989 world tour. That led to her Grammy appearance and, at next week's Country Music Association Awards, a nomination for female artist of the year. All told, it's turned out pretty well for someone who was shunned by the establishment when she first arrived in Nashville. ""I could not get into a room with a hit writer to save my life,"" she recalls of making her first album. ""I was a new girl, on an independent label and those were two strikes against me. No-one would write with me."" It turned out to be a blessing. Left to her own devices, Ballerini, whose first concert was Britney Spears, channelled her love of pop and R&B into the album, giving her songs a vitality and immediacy that's sometimes missing from traditional country. The star's co-producer, Forest Glen Whitehead, even refers to her as a ""country Beyonce"". ""I grew up on a farm in Eastern Tennessee and country is where my roots are,"" explains the singer, ""but I listen to rap and I listen to R&B and I love pop. ""I've always been open about that because, as a songwriter, I always want to make sure that I'm trying new things."" Despite the strength of her singles, Ballerini still faced an uphill struggle in the insular world of country. Her debut came out in the midst of what's been called ""tomato-gate"", where radio consultant Keith Hill advised stations not to play too many songs by women and not to play two women back to back. ""If you want to make ratings in country radio, take females out,"" he told trade publication Country Radio Aircheck. ""They're just not the lettuce in our salad. The lettuce is Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton, Keith Urban and artists like that. The tomatoes of our salad are the females."" Like many others, Ballerini was perplexed by his comments. ""When you think of country music history obviously you have George Jones, Garth Brooks, George Strait - all these iconic males. But you cannot talk about the history of country music without Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Shania Twain. I mean some of the biggest artists in country music history are female."" In the end, she thinks, the uproar over Hill's comments helped her cause. ""Love Me Like You Mean It was in the top five when tomato-gate came out - and I think radio stations went, 'Well, watch this!' and helped me get to number one."" But how do you follow up such a successful debut? With great difficulty, says Ballerini. ""I didn't know how to make my second record for a long time. ""The first one worked so well that I was like, 'How do I make that record again?' And then I realised I can't. That's not who I am any more."" The answer was simple: Write an album about the person she's become - and luckily Ballerini had a lot of material to draw on. No more love songs? Unapologetically, released this Friday, is the chronological story of the last two years, as the singer left behind a ""gross break-up"" and got engaged to fellow country singer Morgan Evans. One of the first tracks is Miss Me More, a slinky stomp in which the singer describes how her ex-boyfriend slowly eroded her identity. ""I retired my red lipstick 'cause you said you didn't like it,"" she sings. ""I didn't wear my high heel shoes / 'Cause I couldn't be taller than you."" ""In a lot of young relationships, you fall in love for the first time and you give every part of yourself to make it work,"" she explains. ""But sometimes, when it's not treated right, that's how you lose yourself. ""I think it's really a beautiful moment when you get to the other side, and you're looking in the mirror and you're like, 'Huh, I thought I was going to miss him but - actually - I miss me!'"" Ballerini says she found it easier to write those ""super dark"" lyrics than the love songs that close the album. In fact, she's so bad at the soppy stuff that she came up with a track called I Hate Love Songs. A pastiche of saccharine 1950s doo-wop hits, it opens with the lyric: ""I hate Shakespeare and Gosling and cakes with white frosting."" ""Do I really hate Ryan Gosling? Lord no!"" she screeches. ""He's a beautiful man! ""But I love that song. It talks about that heart and head battle. I don't want to be a cliched person in love; but I kind of am turning into that. ""Then the next song [on the album] is Unapologetically, where it's finally like I'm fully in love. I love the tension of those two together."" With its pop leanings and infectiously catchy choruses, Unapologetically looks destined to bring Ballerini to a wider audience - and the UK in particular. Lead single Legends has been playlisted by BBC Radio 2, while the singer is booked to play the Country to Country festival in London and Glasgow next March. She'll also perform a duet with country legend Reba McIntyre (""it's going to be so cool"") at the CMA Awards, which will be screened later in the month on BBC Four. Just don't expect Ballerini to stop being star-struck as her own star rises. ""I still freak out when I'm around Carrie Underwood,"" she laughs, ""and now I see her all the time."" Unapologetically is released on Friday, 3 November. Highlights of the CMA Awards will be broadcast on BBC Radio 2 on Sunday, 11 November and later in the month on BBC Four.

Meanwhile, the BBC revealed the new Top Gear series, fronted by Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc, will debut on 29 May. The BBC Two show announced its return on Twitter, shortly after The Grand Tour was introduced. Evans was named as Top Gear's new host last year after the BBC opted not to renew Clarkson's contract in the wake of his much-publicised ""fracas"" with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon. Clarkson later apologised and settled a £100,000 racial discrimination and injury claim from Tymon. 'A new frontier' The Grand Tour will launch this autumn and will be available to watch exclusively by Amazon Prime members. The ""round-the-world"" format will allow customers of different nations to be in the audience as tickets are to be released through prize draws this summer. The name befits the presenters' wish to make a new show noticeably different from what they had presented before, which was mainly studio-based with pre-recorded segments and big set pieces. Top Gear's long-time producer Andy Wilman also left the BBC last year to join the presenters and work with them on the Amazon show. In a tongue-in-cheek statement, Clarkson said: ""We'll be travelling the world hosting each episode in a different country. It's sort of a 'grand tour', if you like. So we've decided to call it 'The Grand Tour'."" In response, May remarked that he was underwhelmed by the name and had ""wanted to call it 'Nigel', or 'Roger'"". ""We needed a name, and they're names,"" he said. Hammond on the other hand, was more positive, saying: ""I already love camping, but this is something else"". ""We are like our pioneering and prospecting forebears, sallying forth into a new frontier of broadcasting.""","Former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May's new show on Amazon's streaming video service will be called The Grand Tour."
"They go up against home-grown stars Geneva Carr and Elisabeth Moss, in a year where British talent is particularly well-recognised. Three of the four best director nominees are British, while Bill Nighy and Ben Miles are in the running for best actor. The awards will be presented on 7 June. Musicals An American in Paris and Fun Home are the front-runners, each landing 12 nominations on Tuesday, showing two sides of the Broadway experience. An American in Paris is a sunny, heavily-choreographed adaptation of the 1951 film; while Fun Home is a moody show based on Alison Bechdel's graphic novel about her suicidal father. The nominations also ranged from 11-year-old Sydney Lucas in Fun Home to the 82-year-old Chita Rivera, looking for her third Tony. 'Fantastic day' British talent accounts for 24 nominations in total, with two West End transfers - Wolf Hall and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, up for best play. Dame Helen is recognised for her role as Queen Elizabeth II in The Audience, which imagines the private weekly meetings between the monarch and eight of her prime ministers. She already has an Olivier Award for the London production, and an Oscar for portraying the Queen on the big screen. ""I've studied the shape of her mouth,"" said Dame Helen. ""I know her face probably better than anyone else does. But it's only my portrait,"" she said. ""I can only surmise and imagine."" Ruth Wilson is shortlisted for her role in Constellations, the tale of a relationship playing out across alternate universes. Her co-star Jake Gyllenhall missed out on a nomination, however, joining other notable omissions such as Larry David's Fish in the Dark; and Finding Neverland, the JM Barrie musical produced by Hollywood heavyweight Harvey Weinstein, with music by Gary Barlow. Carey Mulligan and Bill Nighy are both nominated for Skylight, a revival of David Hare's 1995 drama, in which they play mis-matched lovers, as is co-star Matthew Beard. Director Stephen Daldry - best known for his work on the films Billy Elliot and The Hours - is also up for best director for the play. Daldry, who also directed The Audience, said: ""It is a fantastic day for British theatre on Broadway. I am personally thrilled for The Audience and Skylight, and delighted too for Wolf Hall and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time"" The latter, which began life at the National Theatre, was nominated for best play, with British director Marianne Elliott also receiving a nod. ""It feels amazing,"" she told the BBC. ""We had no idea when we first started how the hell this play was going to go down. We were taking big risks, we felt. We had no idea whether there'd be an audience for it. So to see it go to Broadway is quite amazing."" Curious Incident has six nominations in all, Skylight seven, while the RSC's double bill of Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies has eight, including a best actor listing for Ben Miles, who plays Thomas Cromwell, and best director for Jeremy Herrin. Other notable nominees included Bradley Cooper, up for best actor for his portrayal of Joseph Merrick in The Elephant Man; and Sting, who was shortlisted for best original score, despite his musical The Last Ship closing early. Cooper, who will perform the play in the West End next month, said: ""To be a part of a community that gathers together in a 13 block radius, eight shows a week, no matter what, in the greatest city in the world - for one sole purpose, to tell stories - I can't think of a better job to have. Thank you for letting The Elephant Man be a part of this season's story telling.""

"The BBFC report said the film contained ""moderate violence and threat, and infrequent strong language"". Cuts were made to the original Hunger Games film in 2012 in order to achieve a teen-friendly rating in the UK. The latest film, starring Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, is out in the UK on 21 November. The BBFC report also revealed that the sequel, directed by Francis Lawrence, runs to 146 minutes and 2 seconds. The movie series is based on the best-selling trilogy of novels by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic America where adolescents fight to the death on live TV, the cast includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland. The first instalment of the franchise made £27.2m at the UK box office, and nearly $700 million (£441m) worldwide. It had faced a 15 certificate in the UK, until its distributor Lions Gate UK chose to make seven seconds of cuts - included the digital removal of ""blood splashes"" - in order to achieve a lower rating. ""These cuts were made in addition to reductions already made following an earlier 'advice' viewing of an incomplete version,"" the BBFC noted at the time. In the US, The Hunger Games was rated PG-13 for ""intense violent thematic material and disturbing images - all involving teens"".

"The actress alleges she was left in tears after Weinstein objected to an outfit she wore to a premiere, which he said made her ""look like a lesbian"". The disgraced movie producer was sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault on Wednesday. Representatives for Weinstein said he was unable to respond to Beckinsale's claims. White suit instead of a dress In an Instagram post which contains highly offensive language, Beckinsale uploaded a picture of her outfit and recalled her encounter with Weinstein. The actress said she was reluctant to attend the premiere for her film Serendipity because it took place less than a month after the 9/11 terror attacks, which she says felt ""disrespectful"". But Beckinsale claims Weinstein, whose entertainment company Miramax distributed the film, ""insisted"" the premiere go ahead. The actress agreed to attend the event as a result and was photographed attending wearing a white suit on 5 October, 2001. However, she alleges, Weinstein invited her to his house so their young daughters could have a playdate the following morning, where he was verbally abusive towards her. Beckinsale says Weinstein told her she had ""ruined"" his premiere by wearing the outfit. ""He said: 'If I am throwing a red carpet you get in a tight dress, you shake your ass... you do not go down it looking like a lesbian',"" Beckinsale recalled in the post. The actress said she was ""screaming"" and livid"" after the exchange, which made her ""burst into tears"". Beckinsale said her two-year-old daughter and Weinstein's young daughter were in the house at the time, but being looked after by Weinstein's nanny in a separate room. ""I managed to get myself and my child out of there and yes that was one of many experiences I had that there was no recourse for, and falls under no felony,"" Beckinsale said. Some of the actress's followers questioned the timing of her Instagram post and asked why she had waited until after Weinstein's trial and sentencing to tell the story. Dozens of women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct, including rape, against Weinstein since October 2017. He has consistently denied wrongdoing and his lawyers have vowed to appeal against his conviction for rape and sexual assault. Speaking in court on Wednesday, Weinstein saying he had ""deep remorse"" but described him and other men as ""totally confused"" by events, in comments seen as critical to the #MeToo movement. Hours after being sentenced, Weinstein was taken to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan with chest pains, a spokesman said. He had heart surgery after his conviction. Actress Reese Witherspoon welcomed Weinstein's sentencing, writing on Twitter: ""A historical moment today. I am so appreciative of the women and men who spoke up about the abuse and harassment they suffered at the hands of Harvey Weinstein."" In her Instagram post, Beckinsale said the movie mogul's prison sentence was ""a huge relief to me on behalf of all the women he sexually assaulted or raped, and I hope will be a deterrent to that sort of behaviour in this and any other industry.""

After the fourth series there had been hopes it would live on as a big screen version, but a film never materialised.

"By Neil SmithEntertainment reporter Fans also got new glimpses of Black Widow and the new Minions movie. Bill Murray, Chris Rock and Winona Ryder were a few of the Hollywood stars enlisted to star in adverts on one of the biggest nights in the US television-watching calendar. The cost of a 30-second spot during the game can be more than $5m (£3.8m). Yet that is considered a price worth paying for the exposure a slot during the annual American Football showdown can bring to a film, TV show or product. The 30-second trailer for No Time To Die, the 25th official Bond film, opened with a previously unseen scene showing Daniel Craig's Bond in a hi-tech glider. ""Have you ever flown one of these things before?"" he asks Lashana Lynch's Nomi, a fellow secret agent, who responds with ""Nope"". The ""official game day spot"" continued with a promise that ""the 25th film will change everything"" when it arrives in cinemas in April. The film, billed as Craig's final outing as Bond, will see his character return to active service to combat a new adversary, played by Bohemian Rhapsody's Rami Malek. Two of this year's Oscar nominees were seen joining forces in the promo for Black Widow, the latest superhero film from Marvel Studios. Scarlett Johansson and Florence Pugh appear alongside Rachel Weisz in the 30-second teaser for the first stand-alone outing for Johansson's Natasha Romanoff character. ""At some point we all have to choose between what the world wants you to be and who you are,"" she is heard saying amid scenes of explosive mayhem. Johansson and Pugh were both up for prizes at Sunday's Bafta Film Awards - two in Scarlett's case - but each left empty-handed. There was more ominous voiceover work in the trailer for Top Gun: Maverick, this time emanating from actor Miles Teller. ""My dad believed in you,"" his character is heard telling Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise. ""I'm not going to make the same mistake."" The long-awaited sequel to 1986's Top Gun sees Cruise's hotshot jet pilot become instructor to the son of his deceased former flying partner. Dramatic scenes of Cruise in the cockpit of an F/A-18F Super Hornet pad out the trailer for the film, which lands in cinemas in July. Other sequels to be promoted during the Super Bowl included Fast & Furious 9, A Quiet Place Part II and Minions: The Rise of Gru. The latter - another outing for the yellow helpers from the Despicable Me series - promised a check-list of elements including ""action, bad guys, snacks, explosions [and] nuns"". A similar tactic was employed by an ad for The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run, whose own itinerary included ""fast cars, robots [and] a wise sage"" played by Keanu Reeves. A promo for the new Sonic the Hedgehog film, meanwhile, saw US sports stars Michael Thomas, Kyle Busch and Allyson Felix sing the praises of its spiny hero. Streaming giants also got in on the action during Sunday's game, with Amazon Prime unveiling an ad for its new drama Hunters. The series, which premieres later this month, stars Al Pacino as the head of a team of Nazi-hunters out to thwart the creation of a Fourth Reich in 1970s America. Disney + also unveiled its own forthcoming wares, a trio of shows built around characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe - The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Loki. Another Disney enterprise, its live action retelling of 1998 animation Mulan, was promoted by a trailer running two minutes in length. Other Super Bowl adverts saw famous names co-opting scenes from well-known films to promote products. They included Bill Murray, who appeared in an ad for car giant Jeep, which saw him parody scenes from his 1993 comedy Groundhog Day. Bryan Cranston was seen wielding an axe in an advert for soft drink Mountain Dew, which spoofed horror classic The Shining. Sylvester Stallone, meanwhile, recreated his iconic Rocky Balboa character as part of a series of adverts for Facebook fronted by comedian Chris Rock. Winona Ryder could be seen travelling to the Minnesotan city of Winona in a Squarespace ad, while Jonah Hill reunited with Martin Scorsese, who directed him in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street, for Coca Cola, and Gal Gadot and Molly Ringwald popped up in other spots.

"Cruise's time-shifting movie opened in third place, taking $29.1m (£17.3m), despite a budget of $175m (£104m). The Fault in Our Stars made $48.2m (£28.7m), against a more modest budget of $12m (£7.1m), topping the chart. Based on John Green's book, the tragic romance stars Shailene Woodley as a teenager with cancer. The audience was 82% female, film studio figures showed. Changing trends Box office analysts Rentrak said the movie's success, alongside the likes of Twilight and The Hunger Games, showed how big-budget, male-orientated movies now struggled against those with a large, predominantly female, teenage audience. ""The notion of what is traditional summer fare is changing,"" said Paul Dergarabedian. ""Women and young girls are as vitally important to the box office in the summer as the young males, who Hollywood has courted and coveted for decades."" Film studio Twentieth Century Fox said 79% of the audience for The Fault In Our Stars was under the age of 25. The book - about a young couple who meet at a cancer support group - generated a huge following on social media and the trailer has been watched more than 21 million times on YouTube. Edge of Tomorrow, which co-stars Emily Blunt and Cruise in a Groundhog Day-style time loop as they battle an alien invasion, appealed more to men, who made up 61% of the audience. However the film did top the international box office, taking a total of $82m (£48.7m) around the world - much of that in China, Korea and Russia. Elsewhere in the US chart, Maleficent dropped to second place. The Disney fairytale, starring Angelina Jolie, took $33.5m (£19.9m) in its second week after debuting in the top spot.

"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter You reach deep into your bookcase and pull out your much-thumbed 1990 edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists. Because why wouldn't you? It's a terrific read, packed with expertly abridged biographies of Old Masters and pithy explanations for arcane techniques like encaustic painting (a favourite of Jasper Johns). No wonder we keep going back to it. But, like all things, it is not faultless. There is one surprising and glaring omission. Open it up at page 239, look under K, and you will discover there is no entry for Frida Kahlo beyond the words: ""see RIVERA, DIEGO"". Rivera, who was Kahlo's husband, is afforded a lengthy entry in which he is described as a ""…most celebrated figure"" and ""leading artist"", who made art ""glorifying the history and people of the country [Mexico]…"". It is not until you reach the bits-and-pieces information right at the end that we learn, ""He had numerous love affairs and was three times married, his second wife being a painter, Frida Kahlo (1907-54)."" Not ""the"" painter, or ""fellow artist"", but simply a glib dismissal as ""painter"". Given Kahlo's current status as one of the most famous and revered artists of the 20th Century, it seems like the most extraordinary oversight. And so it is, but it is also instructive. We learn at least three things about the art establishment from the omission: The idea that any reputable art history directory would omit Frida Kahlo today is laughable. Indeed, the current edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art & Artists boasts a reasonably lengthy entry under her name. But, once again, it is revealing. The Rivera entry begins with his art credentials: ""Mexican painter, the most celebrated figure in…fresco painting that is Mexico's most distinctive contribution to modern art."" Whereas Kahlo's entry begins: ""Mexican painter. In 1929, when she was still at school, she suffered appalling injuries in a traffic accident, leaving her a permanent semi-invalid, often in severe pain."" It is her personal story, the bolstering of her myth that is deemed the most important thing to say about her, not the nature or style of the paintings she produced, which is surely the reason for the entry in the first place. So, here we are, more than 60 years after her death aged 47, totally fixated by the cult of Kahlo: a packaged personality that all but obscures what we should really care about, which is her work. The exhibition at the V&A is a typical case in point. To their credit, the curators are not trying to hide the fact that they are selling a show based on the artist's iconic image rather than her paintings, by giving it the title: Frida Kahlo, Making Herself Up. To be honest, my heart sank when I was told the premise of the show was to look at how she constructed her personality and why. Here we go again, yet more myth making. Couldn't we examine how she made her work and why instead? Wouldn't that be more interesting? But as I walked around the show, the vast majority of which is made up of objects that were locked away in the bathroom of her house in Mexico for half a century (more myth making), it became increasingly apparent that in Kahlo's case there is no separation between art and artist: they are one and the same. It turns out the show isn't a hackneyed hagiography at all, but a revelation. From the early family photograph in which an androgynous-looking Frida is wearing a three-piece suit, to the image of her sitting on a Manhattan rooftop dressed in her spectacular Mexican clothes and smoking a cigarette, it becomes crystal clear that from her late teens onwards, Frida Kahlo was essentially a performance artist. The image we have of her, the public image she developed (even when pictured in ""private""), the Frida on show here, is as much an artwork by her as one of her paintings. The traditional Mexican clothes she wore, the indigenous jewellery she collected, the photographs for which she posed, the monobrow, the moustache, her attitude: every detail was meticulously considered and curated by the artist to communicate to us her ideas, ideals, and feelings. There is clearly also a performative aspect to her paintings; in so much as she is usually the main protagonist acting out the picture's narrative. The sense of her using her body as a canvas is most explicit in the way she decorated the plaster corsets and prosthetic leg on display in a gallery full of her medicines and medical equipment. And so the more this exhibition seeks to unmask the 'real' Frida the further she disappears behind her defiant façade. By the time you emerge from the theatrical last room of dresses and shoes, you know for sure that you have absolutely no idea who the real Frida Kahlo was. You only know what she wanted to show: what pain looks like, what Mexico looks like, what gender looks like; what love looks like. It is her agenda, not ours. We can mythologise her all we like, but to do so is to miss the point. As this exhibition makes abundantly clear, maybe not entirely intentionally, Frida Kahlo only ever revealed one thing to us: art - in all her guises.","If you're anything like me, I bet I know what you do with those few fleeting moments of spare time you have (between watching episodes of Love Island or World Cup matches)."
"Will GompertzArts editor@WillGompertzBBCon Twitter Obviously, we do our best to avoid them. For example, if you were going to splash out on a night at the theatre to see a new play, you might want to check out the talent first. If one of the actors was a two-time Oscar-winner whose work you greatly admire, playing opposite a first-class character-actor who's just been in a hit TV show, you might be inclined to give it a go. Especially if you also spotted it was being staged by one of the finest theatre directors in the country, at the National Theatre, and had been written by a leading playwright. You might even feel a little smug that you had a ticket to the sold-out show when others were queuing from 4am in the hope of buying one of few made available on a first-come-first-served basis every day. That was certainly the vibe in the house on Wednesday at the National's Dorfman Theatre for the opening night of Martin Crimp's latest play, When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other: his riff on Samuel Richardson's 18th Century novel, Pamela. The book caused a sensation when it was published in 1740, what with its 15-year old protagonist Pamela, being abducted, abused and threatened with rape by Mr. B, a charismatic libertine with a very nasty streak. There had been talk of the play being even more outrageous, with scenes of sex and violence so graphic theatre-goers were fainting. Hence, a palpable sense of expectation as the audience waited for the actors to enter the stage, which had been transformed into a suburban double garage with a black Audi parked in one bay, and a fridge and a few chairs scattered about in the other. That sense of anticipation went up several notches when Cate Blanchett (The Aviator, Blue Jasmine) appeared in a dark blue dressing gown with black masking tape covering her mouth. And then Stephen Dillane (Game of Thrones) entered, accompanied by a menacing-looking small gang, all of whom were similarly gagged. It felt very ominous. You could almost hear the audience collectively buckling up. This was going to be a shocker. And so it turned out to be. A shockingly disappointing play. At least, it was in terms of it being a play in the conventional sense. Blanchett and Dillane, the two main characters, are known to us only as Woman and Man. They spar continually, each taking turns to be the dominant character, while constantly changing and swapping clothes and identities in two hours (without a break) of sexualised role-play. Sometimes they get into the car and thrash about a bit and argue, sometimes they sit in chairs and thrash about a bit and argue. She writes, he whinges; he boasts, she whinges. They are both unbearable bores. They are watched throughout by four youngsters who also change roles at the flick of a light switch. Mrs Jewkes (Jessica Gunning), one of the gang, plays the role of the complicit Housekeeper from Richardson's novel, except here she is brandishing a whip and trying to get off with Woman. There are occasional moments of sex and violence, which are more hammy than horrid. I couldn't see anything obviously faint-inducing as has been reported. Maybe the person who witnessed such an occurrence was mistaken and the audience member in question had simply nodded off (someone behind me was snoring very loudly). Foreboding background music is played throughout to generate a sense of unease and imminent danger. It works. An air of suspense hovers over the production like a dark cloud. Except nothing ever happens. The whole thing is a tease. Which is the point of course. That's what the two middle-aged, self-obsessed, S&M lovers like to do when dressed up in their matching French maids' outfits. Their chosen form of torture is more the psychological kind rather than physical. That said, there is one moment early on when Woman allows herself to be the victim of violence, which Cate Blanchett plays to perfection. In fact, she is excellent throughout. As is Stephen Dillane and the rest of the cast. Added to which, so is Katie Mitchell's directing and Vicki Mortimer's set. The problem isn't with them, it is with the play. It just doesn't work as a piece of theatre in the traditional sense. You don't care about the characters, the dialogue is tedious, and the dramatic elements are clunky. An out-and-out flop, then? Err. No. Not at all. Quite the opposite, actually. Approached another way, not as a regular play in a theatre but as a piece of performance art installed within a proscenium arch, When We Have Sufficiently Tortured Each Other becomes a very different thing. The need to suspend disbelief recedes, as does the desire to be entertained. The fact that it is disjointed, knowingly performative, and more interested in exploring textual ideas than sexual mores, becomes a delight not a downer. Encounter it as a piece of site-specific art frees you up, it allows you as a viewer to engage with the work in a different way; your expectations change: your relationship with it is on a different footing. And from that point of view it is a very successful, intellectually challenging, exploration of the spoken and written word. It isn't so much about gender dynamics, which might be the obvious reading of the play, but more about the shifting power and effects of language. So, all that incessant banter between Woman and Man suddenly becomes endlessly fascinating, because it is the talking, the words, which are the essential subject of the piece, rather than simply being a device for describing the action taking place. The text is the scaffolding around which Martin Crimp builds what amounts to short vignettes to investigate how the meaning of words and language change when seen and heard from different angles. And how that, in turn, might affect us emotionally, intellectually or psychologically. There is so much to explore in this complex, complicated, atypical work. If you go expecting a classic three-parter with a conventional plot and dramatic arc, you will be disappointed. In fact, I suspect you'll hate it. If, however, you're up for a work of art that is difficult, oblique, frustrating, and at times tedious - in other words, hard work - then set your alarm clock for 4am and start queuing. I'll see you there.","Life is full of disappointments. The rain-soaked summer holiday. A terrible blind date. Passport photos. Politicians. We know, let-downs are inevitable."
"He is currently facing five charges relating to two women in New York. He has previously admitted his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"". His spokesperson has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down. Here are some of those who have made allegations against him. Rose McGowan The actress has accused Weinstein of raping her by performing oral sex in a hotel at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, when she was 23 and had just appeared in Scream. She later reached a $100,000 settlement with him - and says he offered her $1m for a further non-disclosure deal to stay silent. She declined and has been one of his most vocal accusers. Annabella Sciorra The Emmy-nominated former Sopranos actress has alleged that Weinstein forced himself into her apartment in New York in 1992 and raped her. ""I was so ashamed of what happened,"" Sciorra told the New Yorker. ""And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?"" Ashley Judd The actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower. She refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career. Director Peter Jackson has come forward to say he removed her from a casting list ""as a direct result"" of what he now thinks was ""false information"" provided by Weinstein. In May 2018 Judd sued Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advances but a Los Angeles court later dismissed her sexual harassment suit. Her defamation claim may still proceed, the judge said. Mira Sorvino The Mighty Aphrodite star says he harassed her in a hotel room in 1995. ""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" she said. Like with Ashley Judd, Peter Jackson said Weinstein warned him off casting her. Salma Hayek The Frida actress says she turned down repeated sexual advances from Weinstein while making the 2002 film Frida. And she says his persuasion tactics included threats. Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't."" Asia Argento The Italian actress and director Asia Argento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage in a hotel room on the French Riviera, but he then raped her. Weinstein ""terrified me, and he was so big"", she said. ""It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare."" Lucia Evans Lucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting. ""The type of control he exerted, it was very real,"" she told The New Yorker. ""Even just his presence was intimidating."" Paz de la Huerta The Boardwalk Empire star has accused Weinstein of raping her twice in New York in 2010. The first time was after he offered her a ride home, and the second was when he turned up uninvited at her apartment. ""I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, 'I don't want to do this',"" she said. Gwyneth Paltrow Paltrow says Weinstein asked her to give him a massage in his hotel suite after casting her in the leading role of 1996's Emma when she was 22. She refused. ""He screamed at me for a long time. It was brutal,"" she said. She told then boyfriend Brad Pitt - who threatened to kill the producer if he did anything like that to Paltrow again. Mimi Haleyi Former production worker Mimi Haleyi alleges that she was raped by Weinstein when he forcibly performed oral sex on her in 2006 in his New York apartment. ""I told him 'no, no, no'. But he insisted,"" Ms Haleyi told a press conference in New York. Dominique Huett The actress also alleges she was raped by Weinstein when he performed oral sex on her without her consent. She says he lured her to a hotel room in 2010 under the guise of helping her procure future TV and film roles. ""I didn't know how to say no to someone like him at the time, which I regret,"" she said. Natassia Malthe The Norwegian actress accuses Weinstein of raping her in a London hotel after the 2008 Bafta Awards ceremony. She also alleges that he then asked her to engage in a threesome with him and another woman when back in Los Angeles following the Baftas. Lysette Anthony British actress Lysette Anthony says he carried out a ""pathetic, revolting"" attack at her London home in the late 1980s, which left her ""disgusted and embarrassed"". Lysette Anthony told The Sunday Times she had reported an attack by Weinstein to the Metropolitan Police in London. Cara Delevingne In an Instagram post, Delevingne writes how uncomfortable she felt during an encounter with Weinstein in a hotel room and describes what allegedly happened when she told him she wanted to leave. ""He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room,"" she says. Lea Seydoux The French actress has written about how he invited her to come to his hotel room for a drink. ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me,"" she wrote in The Guardian. ""I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him."" Angelina Jolie Jolie says she was propositioned by Weinstein in a hotel room in 1998. ""I had a bad experience with Harvey Weinstein in my youth, and as a result, chose never to work with him again and warn others when they did,"" she said. Uma Thurman The Pulp Fiction actress says Weinstein pushed her down and ""tried to expose himself"" at the producer's hotel room in London during the 1990s. ""He tried to shove himself on me... He did all kinds of unpleasant things,"" Thurman said. ""But he didn't actually put his back into it and force me. You're like an animal wriggling away, like a lizard."" Heather Graham The Boogie Nights actress told Variety she was once propositioned by Weinstein in the early 2000s when she met him to discuss being cast in one of his movies. She alleges he implied she had to sleep with him to get a film role, telling her that his wife would have been fine with it. Zoe Brock The model and actress says he asked for a massage in the south of France in 1997. She said: ""I didn't know what to do and I felt that letting him maybe touch me a little bit might placate him enough to get me out of there somehow."" Before long, she ""bolted"" into the bathroom. He banged on the door with his fists before eventually retreating, putting on a dressing gown and starting to cry. Louisette Geiss The actress and producer says she was attacked by Weinstein when he invited her to his office in a hotel for a meeting about a script she had written at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. He insisted on listening to her pitch in his hot tub, then asked her to watch him masturbate, she says - and told her he could green-light her script if she did so. She left. Daryl Hannah The Splash actress says she repeatedly turned down Weinstein's advances during promotion for Kill Bill and its sequel. He tried, she says, to get into her hotel room on multiple occasions, once getting a key and ""burst[ing] in like a raging bull."" He asked to grope her breasts and then asked her to expose herself to him, she alleges. She suffered physical repercussions as her flights were cancelled and she was left stranded after she turned him down on one occasion, she adds. Rosanna Arquette The actress says she rejected Weinstein's advances and that she believes her acting career suffered as a result. She told the New York Times in the early 1990s she was directed to his hotel room, where he was in a bathrobe and asked her for a massage. When she refused she says he grabbed her hand and pulled it toward his crotch. More voices Model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez has said she was groped by Weinstein and later went to New York police in 2015, saying the producer assaulted her. She then met Weinstein wearing a hidden microphone. But prosecutors took no action. Other stars to have detailed how he made advances in his home or hotel rooms include Brit Marling, Lupita Nyong'O, Lena Headey and Kate Beckinsale. Other women who have come forward since then with their stories include French actresses Florence Darel, Judith Godreche and Emma de Caunes. British model Kadian Noble, US actresses Jessica Barth, Katherine Kendall and aspiring actresses Dawn Denning, who is now a costume designer, Tomi-Ann Roberts, who is now a psychology professor, have also gone on the record. TV anchor Lauren Sivan alleges Weinstein cornered her in an empty basement area of a New York restaurant in 2007 and masturbated in front of her. And other workers at the Weinstein film company told the New Yorker about their experiences, including Emily Nestor, who was a temporary front desk assistant who said she had had to refuse his advances ""at least a dozen times"". Actress Claire Forlani has said ""nothing happened"" between her and Weinstein - but only because she ""escaped five times"". In an interview with Canadian TV, actress Lauren Holly said the producer approached her naked and requested a massage, at which point she ""pushed him and ran"". Zelda Perkins, a British former assistant of Harvey Weinstein, says she resigned after a colleague accused him of trying to rape her. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister issued a statement on 10 October in response to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault. ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein,"" she said. ""Mr Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. ""Mr Weinstein obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Foy won best actress in a play for her performance in Lungs, while Scott took home best actor for Present Laughter. A new musical - & Juliet - which features the songs of Britney Spears, Pink, Justin Timberlake and Katy Perry, took home the most prizes, winning six of the 13 awards it was nominated for. The winners are decided by members of the public as opposed to critics. Prizes for & Juliet included best actress in a musical for its lead, Miriam-Teak Lee, as well as technical categories such as sound, lighting, costume and set design. The show features music by the prolific songwriter Max Martin including hits by Kesha, Jessie J and the Backstreet Boys and imagines what would have happened if Romeo had died but Juliet had lived. There were wins in major categories for Come From Away - the musical that tells the true story of how a small Canadian community reacted to 9/11. When the terror attack took place on New York's Twin Towers, 38 planes were diverted to an airport in Newfoundland, Canada, where locals offered food and shelter to the incoming passengers. The show won five awards in total, including best new musical and best supporting actress for Rachel Tucker, who played one of the plane's pilots. Best new play was won by Life of Pi - a new adaptation of Yann Martel's Booker-winning novel - which has previously been turned into a successful film. Dear Evan Hansen, which explores ""grief tourism"" after a teen suicide, won two major prizes - best actor for Sam Tutty and best supporting actor for Jack Loxton. Scott's win for Present Laughter follows a hugely successful year for the actor, during which he starred in Fleabag, Black Mirror and the Oscar-winning film 1917.

"By Tim MastersEntertainment correspondent, BBC News While at stage school in the 1970s, her dance teacher Arlene Phillips offered her a place in a raunchy dance troupe she was putting together - called Hot Gossip. Manville turned it down. ""I was a good girl!"" she laughs. ""The whole notion of doing something a bit risque like that was not really how I saw myself."" The decision does not appear to have done Manville's career any harm. This week she is back in cinemas in Mike Leigh's new film, Another Year. Manville is Mike Leigh's most frequent collaborator, having worked with the director on Secrets and Lies, High Hopes, Topsy-Turvy, All or Nothing, Vera Drake, the BBC film Grown-Ups and in radio and theatre. In Another Year, Manville is Mary - a middle-aged woman on a downward spiral of loneliness who seeks solace in drink and the company of her happily-married friends Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen). Another Year has been a film festival hit in Cannes, Toronto and London, and sees Leigh back with his regular family of actors, including Imelda Staunton and Peter Wight. As is the way on Mike Leigh films, there was no script to start with. The characters were built from scratch by actors and director. ""People get a bit surprised when you say you do start with nothing, but that's the truth,"" says Manville. ""We work together and create a character from the beginning of their life. We created Mary's childhood, which wasn't particularly happy, where she went to school, the whole thing. ""We have a few months to do that. The character slowly starts to get under your skin. You end up with a character you can put in any situation and you know how they're going to behave."" How much of a turning point was working with Mike Leigh? ""Oh, massive, it can't be underestimated how it changed everything for me. Up until that point, I worked a lot as a young girl and a teenager, but I didn't really have any direction. ""I never played anybody that wasn't me. That was the great thing - when we met, he showed me I could play all these characters that were really not like me at all. 'Vibrant women' ""We do work really well together and have an inherent understanding. There are some people in your artistic life that you have this link with, and you bring out the best in each other."" Manville's other screen credits include Robert Zemeckis's A Christmas Carol and the yet-to-be released Womb, alongside Doctor Who actor Matt Smith and former Bond girl Eva Green. On stage she appeared in the original production of Les Liaisons Dangereuses, as well as revivals of Edward Bond's Saved and The Pope's Wedding. Her work at the National Theatre includes His Dark Materials, Pillars Of The Community and The Alchemist. And she was recently at the Old Vic in All About My Mother and Six Degrees of Separation. Do characters as strong as Mary turn up in the scripts that land on Manville's desk? ""You tend not to see such interesting characters on television, and most of my film experience has been with Mike,"" she says. ""In the theatre I've played some great characters - in Ibsen's Pillars of the Community I played a wonderful character - a very vibrant woman ahead of her time. But I don't have a list of characters I want to play. I never think like that."" On the subject of Hot Gossip, Manville suggests another way she might get to dance on TV. ""I'd have loved to have done Hot Gossip, but one of the reasons I didn't was the whole thing with the stockings and suspenders. A bit of me thought 'I can't do that - my dad will be so embarrassed - I can't go on television dressed like that!'"" She pauses, and adds: ""I should really do Strictly, shouldn't I? I wouldn't mind dancing for three months every day. I just wouldn't like the whole filming bit."" Another Year is released across the UK on 5 November.",It could have all been so different for actress Lesley Manville.
"He became famous for scoring the Spaghetti Westerns directed by his friend Sergio Leone, such as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. His sparse soundtracks were a vital component of Leone's revolutionary take on the Western genre. Yet this association often pained him because he was, in fact, a composer of great versatility with more than 500 film and TV scores to his credit. Despite his Hollywood success, he remained true to his roots, composing many scores for Italian cinema. Ennio Morricone was born in Rome on 10 Nov 1928. His father was a jazz trumpeter, and the young Morricone took up the instrument at an early age and was writing short compositions by the time he was six. At school, his classmates included Leone - with whom he would later form one of the great director/composer partnerships. ""We weren't friends, we were schoolmates,"" Morricone once said. ""I mean, we were seven years old so we were playing together, but you can't call that a friendship."" Later, his first love was scoring classical pieces but, in order to make a living, he began composing background music for radio drama. He later turned his hand to film scores, but none of them made much impact until his old school friend asked him to write the soundtrack for Per Un Pugno di Dollari (A Fistful of Dollars). With scarcely any budget, Morricone was unable to replicate the lush strings of the early Westerns, instead using electric guitars and a variety of sound effects to punctuate the often violent action on screen. In doing so, he underlined the mythical emptiness of the surrounding landscape and the brutal realities depicted in the film, which would influence Westerns for years to come. Most famously, Morricone penned the memorable and intriguing theme to 1966's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, the third in the Dollars trilogy. With the sounds of coyotes, the trotting of drum rhythms and electric guitar twangs, the track soon became a worldwide hit, reaching the number one spot in Britain in 1968. It also conjured up the familiar imagery of a young Clint Eastwood riding a mule over burning deserts, re-establishing the all-American genre with a unique European irony. Morricone went on to become one of the most prolific composers of his era, with hundreds of film scores in his repertoire. ""I am disturbed when people think about me as a specialist for Westerns,"" he once said. ""They are only a relatively small percentage of the music I've written."" No-nonsense professional His desire to maintain a European bulwark against a dominant US film culture was also important to him. He even opted for handwritten scores over the newly modernised forms of computer scoring. Morricone's work was seen as influential in bringing a certain popular style to the classical sound. He used period jazz phrases in his score for Once Upon a Time in America, to set the right historical context. His score for The Mission (1986) was described as so moving that rather than complementing the film, it overwhelmed it. A no-nonsense professional, Morricone left a legacy of compositions that convey a timeless aura. In 2007 he was, belatedly according to his many fans, awarded an honorary Academy Award, only the second film score composer to receive such an accolade. His six competitive Oscar nominations from 1979 to 2016 were for Days of Heaven, The Mission, The Untouchables, Bugsy, Malena and The Hateful Eight. He finally won for the latter, Quentin Tarantino's revisionist Western. It was Morricone's first Western score for more than three decades. Some deemed his score for Once Upon A Time in America to be his best work. Another favourite was Giuseppe Tornatore's Cinema Paradiso, to which Morricone's son Andrea also contributed. Emotional impact In 2001, for the first time performing in London, Morricone conducted two symphonic concerts dedicated to his film scores at the Barbican Centre. Similarly, for his 75th birthday in 2003, a concert of film music at London's Royal Albert Hall saw musicians conducted by Morricone playing music from a selection of his compelling scores. He never bothered to learn English despite his prominent presence in Hollywood and never lost touch with his Italian roots, remaining in Rome for most of his life. ""I was offered a free villa in Hollywood,"" he said. ""But I said, 'No thank you, I prefer to live in Rome.'"" Morricone's desire to reflect parts of his personality throughout his carefully produced compositions enhanced and transformed the emotional impact of the films, and he successfully adapted his work to many different styles of cinema. He once said: ""Working for the cinema has been a precious experience because it gave me the chance to experiment with my ideas, to listen to them performed by an orchestra, and then use them for a precise aim.""

"They have been distributed at venues including homeless centres, pubs and hospitals in a bid to boost reading. Some 20,000 people were asked to pick their favourite from 25 titles and were then given 48 copies to pass on to friends with their recommendation. BBC Two is screening an evening of special programmes to mark the event. Organiser Jamie Byng said it had been tough to come up with a shortlist of just 25 books, chosen by a committee of booksellers, librarians and broadcasters. ""We wanted to created a really balanced list that had things on it that would appeal to everyone,"" he told the BBC. The idea has had widespread support from authors, although some independent booksellers have raised concerns the event could damage future sales. Writer Philip Pullman, whose book Northern Lights is among those being given away, told the BBC he was ""thrilled"" by the event. ""It's a wonderful idea,"" he said. ""It's a very original and yet it seems so obvious. Give books to people and they enjoy them and go and buy more books."" Asked which book he would particularly recommend, he said the Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid. ""It's a wonderful book. Everybody should read that."" The BBC Two schedule includes three Culture Show Specials and a premiere of BBC Films' adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Live broadcasts from World Book Night events in Glasgow, Manchester and London will be broadcast in between the TV programmes. Library closures On Friday some of the most celebrated artists from stage, screen, literature and art took part in a launch event compered by Graham Norton in London's Trafalgar Square. Margaret Atwood, Alan Bennett and Nick Cave were just some of the names that participated. Talking Heads writer Bennett drew applause from the crowd when he criticised library closures, calling it tantamount to child abuse, according to the BBC's art correspondent David Sillito The author said that as a child he had been taken to libraries when he had not had books himself. Author Edna O'Brien, who also gave a reading to the thousands who gathered there, said it had felt ""like the big time"". ""Musicians draw great crowds, but usually authors don't,"" she said, adding she thought the event would ""revive interest in reading"". She warned: ""If young people stopped reading banality would spread like a plague.""","One million books, including works by Alan Bennett and John le Carre, have been given away in the UK and Ireland to mark the inaugural World Book Night."
"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Slate Magazine uncovered similarities between the site's entry on Moby-Dick and Dylan's speech, in which he discussed the three books that had the biggest impact on his career. The investigation was prompted by the discovery that the musician had quoted a passage which does not appear in any current editions of Herman Melville's novel. Dylan quoted a Quaker priest who, in the aftermath of a storm at sea, tells another character: ""Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness."" Writer Ben Greenman observed the line did not appear in Melville's novel, suggesting Dylan may have misremembered the book. However, Slate discovered that SparkNotes used similar phrasing, describing the preacher as ""someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness"". It then noted 19 further similarities between Dylan's description of Moby-Dick and the summary on SparkNotes, including: Dylan: ""There's a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahab's doom."" SparkNotes: ""One of the ships ... carries Gabriel, a crazed prophet who predicts doom."" Dylan: ""Captain Boomer - he lost an arm to Moby. But... he's happy to have survived. He can't accept Ahab's lust for vengeance."" SparkNotes: ""Captain Boomer has lost an arm in an encounter with Moby Dick... Boomer, happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ahab's lust for vengeance."" Dylan: ""He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil."" SparkNotes: ""He sees this whale as the embodiment of evil."" In each of these cases, the key phrases (""predicts doom""; ""lust for vengeance""; ""embodiment of evil"") do not appear in Melville's original text. Representatives for Dylan and the Nobel Prize Committee have yet to respond to a request for comment. The musician won the the Nobel Prize for literature in October and had until 10 June to deliver his lecture or forfeit the prize money of 8m krona ($900,000, £727,000). He delivered the speech in the form of a beat poem, recited over a meandering piano, just before the deadline on 4 June - raising the delicious prospect that, like any teenager in a band, he cribbed his homework off the internet in a last-minute panic. But this is not the first time Dylan has been accused of copying someone else's work. He poached some stanzas from 19th-Century Confederate poet Henry Timrod for Modern Times; while some of the lyrics on his 2001 album Love and Theft were allegedly based on Junichi Saga's book Confessions of a Yakuza. 'Master thief' In June 2009, Christie's of New York auctioned one of his earliest handwritten poems, Little Buddy, which had been submitted to his summer camp newspaper in 1957. But eagle-eyed historians spotted that the poem was a thinly-veiled rewrite of a Hank Snow song, also called Little Buddy. And, earlier this year, a British photographer spotted an uncanny similarity between his shot of Blackpool Pier and one of Dylan's paintings, which purports to show Norfolk, Virginia. The musician has defended his interpolation of other people's work as being part of the folk tradition, paying homage to the artists who came before, and re-contextualising their work for a modern audience. ""If I was a master thief, perhaps I'd rob them,"" he sang on Positively 4th Street; while, in a 2012 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, he defended himself against accusations of plagiarism on Love and Theft. ""I'm working within my art form,"" he said. ""It's that simple. I work within the rules and limitations of it. There are authoritarian figures that can explain that kind of art form better to you than I can. It's called songwriting. It has to do with melody and rhythm, and then after that, anything goes.

"The show at the Cartwright Hall gallery will focus on his early life and work. Hockney was born in Bradford in 1937. As a teenager, he would use a pram loaded with paints and brushes as a mobile art studio on the city streets. He went on to find fame at the Royal College of Art in London in the 1960s. A major show of Hockney's landscapes at the Royal Academy earlier this year, titled A Bigger Picture, attracted more than 600,000 people. Cartwright Hall is asking Bradford residents to take items including paintings, drawings, photographs and Christmas cards to a drop-in day on Wednesday 26 September between 11:00 and 15:00 BST, or to contact curators directly. The gallery said it hoped the exhibition, which will run from December until next April, would be ""a truly, uniquely Bradford exhibition"". Hockney studied at Bradford College of Art in the mid-1950s. Cartwright Hall's collection includes Hockney's Bolton Junction, Eccleshill, which was painted while he was at art college and which was featured in the Royal Academy show.

One Direction's singles success kept Bruno Mars' Locked Out of Heaven off the top spot, entering the chart at two, followed by last year's X Factor winners Little Mix at number three with DNA. Other new entries in the singles chart included McFly at number 10 with Love is Easy and Ed Sheeran, who wrote One Direction's Little Things, saw his single Give Me Love reach number 18.

"The producer signed the likes of Marvin Gaye, The Supremes, Stevie Wonder and The Jackson Five to his Detroit label. The award, established in 2012, honours those who have had a ""major influence on generations of songwriters"", said Hall of Fame chairman Jimmy Webb. The ceremony takes place on 13 June in New York, where a new musical based on Gordy's life has just made its debut. Gordy, 83, will be the first living person to receive the accolade, which was posthumously awarded to folk singer Woody Guthrie last year. Webb, writer of such Glen Campbell hits as Wichita Lineman and Galveston, described Gordy as ""an innovator and a visionary"". ""He created a label but more than that, he created a genre,"" Webb said. ""He pioneered a marketplace for African-American artistry and then he invited the world in to enjoy it. ""Berry Gordy and the Motown sound are essential to the American music story."" Previously announced inductees this year include British songwriter Tony Hatch, Mick Jones and Lou Gramm of Foreigner, and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler and Joe Perry. 'Multi-talented artist' Meanwhile, it has been announced that Bob Dylan will be the first rock star to become an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. According to its executive director Virginia Dajani, officials had trouble over whether the 71-year-old should be voted in for his words or his music. ""The board of directors considered the diversity of his work and acknowledged his iconic place in the American culture,'' she said.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter Metal acts like Megadeth, Korn and Thursday have led the way, listing masks on their online stores. My Chemical Romance are selling a stockpile of masks they designed before the pandemic for a show in the desert. The proceeds will go to a fund for those in live music industry who have lost their jobs because of Covid-19. ""We had these masks made to keep you dust-free in the desert, a show that never happened, never will,"" the band said in a statement. Perhaps, they suggested, ""we were unknowingly waiting for the right time"" to send them to fans. Megadeth's masks, which feature their mascot Vic Rattlehead, are being given away to anyone who places an order on their online shop, with a portion of proceeds going towards coronavirus relief. A line of surgical masks emblazoned with the Korn logo have sold out on the band's official website - but they promise more stock is on its way. In the US, where the Center Of Disease Control has recommended the use of face coverings to slow the spread of coronavirus, one manufacturer estimates that four to six billion masks will be produced and sold in the next 12 months. The UK government's scientific advisers were due to meet on Tuesday to discuss whether the public should be urged to wear masks. The music merchandise industry, which was worth $3.5bn (£2.8bn) last year, has been quick to respond to the demand. The landscape has shifted dramatically since Latin pop star J Balvin was accused of cashing in on the coronavirus crisis when he tried to sell branded face masks on his online store last month. He issued a swift apology, saying the promotion ""didn't have my consent"". ""This is not the way I act, even less in a moment like this,"" he added, as the gear was removed from his website. So why aren't bands like Megadeth and Korn being called out in the same way? ""I think the tide has changed,"" says Christiaan Munro, founder and co-owner of live music company Sandbag, which has created merchandise for acts including The Chemical Brothers, Radiohead, Bastille and Blink-182. ""When coronavirus first happened, the face mask was seen as a very negative and scary image. Now, it's going to be something that you wear to the shops. ""It's become an essential rather than a gimmick, and it will become a fashion accessory. That will be the progression."" Munro says his company has been contacted by several artists interested in creating their own masks, and ""the supply chain is being worked out right now"". In many cases, old T-shirts will be recycled to create the masks, meaning ""each one will be unique"". ""Weirdly enough, we were already making a lot of masks,"" Tony Holiday, president of the Toronto-based Kt8 Merchandise Company told Billboard magazine last week. ""A lot of our acts are EDM and in that scene, bandanas and face masks have been popular at festivals for years because of the dust factor. So with the recent demand in face masks, we were already set up to deliver."" Kt8 is donating some of its proceeds to local hospitals and charities, while other merchandise manufacturers are donating surplus stock to be turned into masks and head caps for hospitals. Meanwhile, a number of major fashion brands have also been making protective equipment for medical professionals, with some designers bringing out ranges of masks for public sale. Munro notes that masks were also popular among Asian music fans before the Covid-19 pandemic. ""If you see pictures of people in the cities like Tokyo and Beijing, they worry about Sars or pollution - so there are a lot of face masks being worn,"" he says. ""But they've also been selling face masks on market stalls in downtown LA, in the fashion district, for a long time. It's a utility item and then it flowed over into fashion."" That's why pop acts like Ariana Grande and Little Mix had masks on their merchandise stands before the coronavirus outbreak; while Billie Eilish wore a Gucci mask to Glastonbury and the Grammy Awards, and sells her own branded masks at Urban Outfitters. It should be noted that masks made of fabric or cloth may only provide a small degree of protection and could even increase the risk of infection, according to the European Centre for Disease Control. Munro says that's why UK acts have not so far been inclined to commission their own line of face coverings. ""But I think we'll follow the US, with bands promoting face masks as the general population decides to wear them, with or without instruction from government,"" he says. And while most artists are using the merchandise to raise money for charity, Munro says some will be looking to ""supplement the income they've lost through tours being cancelled"". Sales of T-shirts and hoodies have remained steady during the lockdown, he notes, which could be a lifeline for some smaller acts. ""Interestingly, when tours got cancelled, those artists that have put their tour merchandise [on sale] with the dates that never happened on the back, they've done really well,"" he says. ""It was surprising that people have been supporting the tours even though they didn't get to go to them."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"By Ian YoungsArts reporter At the site of the Hacienda in Manchester, the only remaining evidence of the club is its name. Hacienda Apartments is a block of smart flats that stands where 1,500 people used to gather every night during the hedonistic acid house explosion in the late 80s and early 90s. But despite being knocked down, the club has not quite disappeared without a trace. The fixtures and fittings were salvaged and sold at auction in 2000. Now, a documentary has tracked many of them down. Archive footage of late Hacienda and Factory Records boss Tony Wilson opens the film, titled Do You Own The Dancefloor, which is being screened in Manchester on Saturday. We see him declaring that ""nostalgia is a disease"". Wilson argued that the building should not be preserved, and that erecting flats in the city centre was more important. ""Nostalgia is unnecessary,"" he said. ""People know it happened."" But if nostalgia is a disease, then many Hacienda veterans are terminal cases. One of the club's (unwashed) urinals has been converted into a Madchester shrine, four bollards that once ringed the club's stage now guard an allotment and one of the girders forms part of a recording studio desk. The director with a precious plank First-time film-maker Chris Hughes was not a Hacienda diehard, but went ""a couple of times in the pre-rave years"". He went to the auction in 2000, he says, ""just to see what happened"". ""It was amazing just to see how passionate people were. That imprinted on my brain."" And it was still on his mind when he began looking for a subject for a documentary. That was more than five years ago. He has now completed the film, which will raise money for two charities, Kidneys For Life and Cancer Research. Lots of the Hacienda faithful have stayed in Manchester, while others have taken rave relics to places from Miami to Montreal. ""I found a lot of people want to move on and do new things,"" Hughes says. ""But as soon as you give them the opportunity to talk about the Hacienda, they're off, because it's one of the happiest times of their lives. Everyone we spoke to wanted to reminisce."" At the auction, Hughes purchased a piece of dancefloor. ""As I leave my house in the morning, I've got my coat rack on the left and above that is my bit of the Hacienda floor, in pride of place,"" he says. ""Sometimes I touch it on the way out, sometimes I just look at it. I change my mind as to what I think about it. His opinion swings, he says, from thinking ""it's just a piece of wood, why is it varnished on the wall... to, that's amazing, think of all the people that have danced on it. It's part of history, that"". The great unwashed urinal Mike Shepherd did not go to the auction - but asked a friend to buy something for him. ""I told him, 'Just get something unusual.' And that's what I got."" What he got was a stainless steel urinal. Mr Shepherd went to the Hacienda ""in the very early days"", before the rave scene kicked off, and now collects memorabilia from Manchester's music scene. He has converted the urinal into a display cabinet to store his other Hacienda relics, adding glass shelves, drawers, the Hacienda's yellow and black stripes and lights that change colour to music. But there is one thing he has not done - cleaned it. ""I was going to polish it all, but I thought it would be a shame because it is quite stained,"" he says. ""It adds to it. It adds to the authenticity. ""We did take the trap off it to see if someone might have thrown any drugs down it. But there was nothing in it."" Peter Hook's recycled dancefloor Former Joy Division and New Order bassist Peter Hook co-owned the Hacienda and, when the club's contents were sold, he was auctioneer. ""It was like a big reunion,"" he says. ""It was the first time many of us had got together since the Hacienda closed, so it was quite joyous. ""And to see the importance that people put on these crazy items - the urinal and the door and all this stuff - it was quite humbling to be honest."" Hook himself owns items from bricks to stained glass windows. Five years ago, he created a range of limited edition bass guitars using strips of dancefloor. ""With the amount of perspiration and inspiration that had dripped onto the floor in that place - in particular the amount of music that dancefloor had soaked up - it was perfect to use it as a guitar neck,"" he says. ""The wood was untreated so [it showed] every little nick and high heel stamp. It was like a living sculpture. To keep that and give it a new life, I thought, was wonderful."" The blooming bollards Trevor Johnson designed flyers, posters and merchandise for the Hacienda. A friend asked him to look after four of the traffic bollards that used to stand on the edge of the stage - but he never picked them up. So his wife, also a former Hacienda regular, decided to install them among the chard and artichokes in their allotment in Greater Manchester. ""She just thought, rather than them being abandoned, they should have a home where they'd be cared for a bit more,"" he says. ""She put them down here. So she's back in the club again when she's tending the pears, or whatever. Whether she dances down here when it's quiet, I'm not quite sure. It wouldn't surprise me."" Some other bollards were used in a recreation of the Hacienda at the V&A museum in London in 2012. While fondly remembering the ""unique"" venue, Mr Johnson says they do not worship their artefacts like some people do. The Hacienda and Factory Records fit into a long tradition of creative and industrial invention in Manchester, which is still going on today, he adds. The dancefloor down under When Ian Bowker moved to Sydney three years ago, his piece of Hacienda dancefloor went with him. ""I've still got a bit of Manchester with me, on the wall,"" he says. Mr Bowker bought a strip of dancefloor, had it cut into squares and distributed them to friends from the Hacienda heyday. ""Before I got it framed, I used to take it out with me. I'd have this piece of wood in my pocket. I might have gone to another club, but I'd still have bit of Hacienda with me. Bit crazy really isn't it?"" Mr Bowker got into the rave scene in the early '90s, he says. ""Even at the time, you knew it was special, that you were part of something unique, and you knew it probably wasn't going to last forever."" Do You Own The Dancefloor is being screened at the Royal Northern College of Music on Saturday 15 August.",Manchester's Hacienda nightclub has gone down in history as the epicentre of ecstatic youth culture in the 80s and 90s. The club was demolished 15 years ago. But its contents - from the dancefloor to the urinals - were saved.
"The cinema chain previously hoped to reopen in mid-July and said it already had a plan for safety measures. These include staggered film times, online booking, social distancing, enhanced cleaning protocols and employees wearing protective gear. Cinemas were allowed to reopen on 4 July but most did not do so. Those cinema chains that have already reopened venues have done so on a limited basis. Curzon, for example, welcomed back visitors to two of its sites on 24 July and plans to reopen one more on Friday. They will then begin a staggered reopening plan for other venues in August. Toby Bradon, territory general manager of Vue Entertainment in the UK, said: ""Behind the scenes, we've been working hard to develop safety protocols in line with government guidelines and informed by our recently reopened cinemas across Europe. ""The safety of those who work and visit our sites is paramount and we've therefore taken the time to ensure protocols and staff training are in line with the latest guidance ahead of opening."" Cineworld is set to reopen its cinemas on 31 July, with special 4DX screenings of Harry Potter leading the reopening slate. The cinema chain's spokesperson said: ""4DX screenings have stimulating effects such as motion, water, wind, scent and lighting - timed with precision to enhance what's happening on screen and combined with high-tech motion programming to move your seat in perfect synchronicity."" Vue cinemas back in business from 7 August include those in Doncaster, Oxford, Manchester, Farnborough, Edinburgh, Bromley and Westfield Shepherd's Bush. The company did not specify when the rest of its 90 cinemas would follow suit but it is most likely to be ahead of the much delayed release of Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic Tenet, which is now expected on 26 August in the UK. In May, Vue chief executive Tim Richards told the BBC he hoped to have the chain up and running in time for the launch of Tenet, which was then scheduled for 17 July. The coronavirus pandemic forced cinemas to close their doors around the world in March. As a result, there is now a backlog of films, along with Tenet, which were due to come out this spring and summer, such as Mulan and the new Bond movie No Time To Die. Some other delayed releases The opening Vue film schedule for 7 August will be unveiled on Friday and the Russell Crowe thriller Unhinged - the first new big release since the pandemic hit - is expected to be on the list. Other films on offer at the open Vue sites will include previous releases including the Harry Potter films, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, Batman Begins, Inception and Dunkirk. Earlier this month, the prime minister said indoor theatre, music and performances could start again with socially distanced audiences from the start of August.

"The new network will see up to 21 US-style local TV stations in areas including Belfast, Edinburgh, Cardiff and London. The service will be available to all terrestrial viewers and may also be offered on satellite, cable and online. Ofcom said it will decide on successful applicants this autumn, with the new channels expected to launch next year. Licences will be awarded based on a set of criteria including the provision of local news and current affairs, programme proposals, launch date and commercial viability.

Manchester, Newcastle, Norwich, Nottingham, Oxford, Plymouth, Preston, Sheffield, Southampton and Swansea will also benefit from the service. The areas were selected for having sufficient levels of interest from potential operators and being technically capable of receiving a local TV service. The BBC Trust also published the final details of its funding contribution for the network. As part of the current licence fee settlement, the BBC agreed to contribute up to £25 million for the successful bidder to build the network.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter The songwriter and artist ""passed away of natural causes"" at his home in Texas, said his family in a statement. He was mourned online by those he inspired, including musician Beck and film star Elijah Wood, who called him ""a gentle, beautiful treasure"". Producer Jack Antonoff praised the way Johnston had ""shared fearlessly"". Born in California in 1961 and raised in West Virginia, Johnston became known as a songwriter after moving to Austin, Texas. His reputation in the city grew after he started handing out cassette tapes of his no-frills home recordings to people in the street. A cult figure on the local music scene, he gained wider exposure when MTV filmed a programme on the Austin music scene in 1985 for its series The Cutting Edge. Johnston's performance brought him almost overnight acclaim, and his early home recordings received a belated vinyl release on the indie label Homestead. He was never an accomplished player, and his pinched, high tenor vocals ensured he would never be a mainstream star - but the aching emotional sincerity of songs Life In Vain and True Love Will Find You In The End, earned him a fiercely loyal fanbase. Kurt Cobain once described him as ""the best songwriter on earth,"" and famously wore one of Johnston's t-shirts to the 1992 MTV Awards. Other musicians who have covered Johnston's songs include Pearl Jam, Tom Waits, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens and Yo La Tengo. In 2013, Lana Del Rey and rapper Mac Miller each contributed $10,000 to fund a short film about the singer, with Del Rey recording a version of his song about heartbreak, Some Things Last A Long Time for the soundtrack. Johnston was also known as an artist and comic-book writer, and his magic marker cartoon drawings were an inspiration for The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening. In 1993, he was asked to turn Jeremiah the Innocent, the alien frog featured on the cover of his album Hi, How Are You, into a mural in Austin. In 2006, his artwork was featured in a major exhibition at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. But Johnston was plagued by mental health problems, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, that hindered his career and endangered his life - including one incident where he attempted to crash a plane being piloted by his father. A harrowing documentary, The Devil and Daniel Johnston, released in 2005, showed how fragile he had become, while bringing his music and story to a new audience. ""It sure was embarrassing,"" Johnston reflected in an interview with the Austin Chronicle. ""Every terrible dilemma, every fabled mistake. Nothing I can do about it now, though. I wish they'd added a laugh track to it, because it sure is funny"". Johnston's own musical output had slowed in recent years and, following a farewell tour in 2017, he was largely confined to the family home. 'Prolific output' His brother, Dick Johnston, told the New York Times he had been treated for kidney issues shortly before his death. ""He was still productive, writing songs and drawing, and was just annoyed by his health more than anything,"" he said. ""It was just one thing after another."" In a statement posted on Facebook, Johnston's family remembered him as ""a friend to all"". ""Although he struggled with mental health issues for much of his adult life, Daniel triumphed over his illness through his prolific output of art and songs. ""He inspired countless fans, artists, and songwriters with his message that no matter how dark the day that ""the sun shines down on me"" and ""true love will find you in the end."" As news of his death spread, fans laid flowers and cassettes at the foot of his mural in Austin, while musicians and fellow creators spoke of Johnston's impact on their life. ""There are not enough words I can say about the vitality of Daniel Johnston's musical spirit,"" said musician Zola Jesus. ""He was a huge inspiration to me, to follow my creative impulses no matter how messy or simple."" Indie band Death Cab For Cutie, who covered Johnston's song Dream Scream, wrote that their ""hearts were heavy"". ""His unique songwriting voice, so pure and so direct, spoke to us deeply,"" they continued. ""It is quite safe to say there will never be another like him and thankfully, his music will play on."" David Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, tweeted: ""My dad introduced me to Daniel Johnston's music... Once I'd listened to a few songs, I heard the DNA of so many others' work. A unique and special human being. Rest peacefully, Daniel."" ""Rest in peace... Living your broken dreams forever,"" added Avengers star Mark Ruffalo on Twitter. ""Thank you for your art.""

"The gallery said it had been involved in discussions about acquiring some items from her wardrobe. But it said it only collected items of ""outstanding aesthetic or technical quality"" and no formal offer was made. More than 300 items will now be sold at auction next month instead. Lady Thatcher died two and a half years ago. She was the longest-serving premier of the 20th Century and Britain's only female prime minister to date. The clothes to be auctioned by Christie's include her blue velvet wedding dress and various power suits worn during her tenure in Downing Street, plus handbags and jewellery. A spokesperson for the museum told The Daily Telegraph: ""The V&A politely declined the offer of Baroness Thatcher's clothes, feeling that these records of Britain's political history were best suited to another collection which would focus on their intrinsic social historical value. ""The museum is responsible for chronicling fashionable dress and its collecting policy tends to focus on acquiring examples of outstanding aesthetic or technical quality.""

"Conversations With Friends will follow last year's hit Normal People, which was also adapted from a Rooney novel. And like Normal People, the follow-up is set in Dublin, made by BBC Three and Hulu, and could make stars of its cast. The story follows the tangled relationships of four friends. Find out about the rising stars who will play them: Joe Alwyn The 29-year-old Londoner played Bob Cratchit in the 2019 BBC adaptation of A Christmas Carol and has appeared in films like Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, The Favourite, Mary Queen of Scots and Harriet. He is also Taylor Swift's other half, the assumed inspiration for her song London Boy, and the co-writer on her latest album Folklore. In Conversations With Friends, he will play Nick, a ""handsome but reserved actor"" who has an intense, secret affair with Frances, played by... Alison Oliver This newcomer went to the same drama school as Normal People star Paul Mescal, The Lir Academy in Dublin. And Conversations With Friends could give her a similarly stratospheric rise, because 21-year-old college student Frances is the story's central character. Oliver herself graduated last year and has only one professional credit to her name since then - in a socially-distanced theatre two-hander to an audience of 10 in Dublin last summer. Sasha Lane This 25-year-old US actress knows a thing or two about being plucked from obscurity. At the age of 19, she was spotted while sunbathing on a Florida beach by British director Andrea Arnold, who cast her in the lead role of her award-winning 2016 film American Honey opposite Shia LaBeouf. Since then, Lane has appeared in The Miseducation of Cameron Post, Hellboy and the American remake of British TV drama Utopia. She will play Frances' ex-girlfriend and now best friend, the ""self-assured, outspoken and compelling"" Bobbi. Jemima Kirke Kirke is known for playing Jessa in her childhood friend Lena Dunham's series Girls, and has joined the cast of the forthcoming third season of Netflix comedy Sex Education as the new headmistress. The 35-year-old will star in Conversations With Friends as Nick's wife Melissa, a writer who is fascinated by Frances and Bobbi. The 12-part series will be filmed later this year by director Lenny Abrahamson, who also made Normal People. Piers Wenger, director of BBC Drama, said: ""Lenny's deep affinity for Sally's writing and talent for finding actors to bring her fictional creations to life played a huge part in bringing Normal People so successfully to screen. ""In casting Alison, Sasha, Joe and Jemima, that same flair and instinct is in evidence and we can't wait to see how they will bring Frances, Bobbi, Nick and Melissa to life.""","The cast for the hotly-anticipated TV version of Sally Rooney's novel Conversations With Friends has been announced, including Joe Alwyn, who starred in TV drama A Christmas Carol."

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter When the 21-year-old sits down to write her emotionally-captivating pop songs, she doesn't just want them to be memorable. She wants them to be indelible. ""When we were writing, we said that if a lyric isn't painfully honest and really brutal, then it can't be on the song,"" she says. ""That's what I aim for: If it doesn't look like a really dodgy, tattoo-on-the-arm lyric, then it doesn't go on."" So far, no-one's actually inked one of her songs onto their wrist (""obviously I'm doing something wrong,"" she laughs) but it won't be long. Humberstone's sparse arrangements and effortless vocals focus your attention on those lyrics - a mixture of acutely-observed detail and conversational asides. ""You never smoked this much before we met,"" she sings on the recent single, Falling Asleep At The Wheel, raking over the embers of a dying relationship. ""Don't know how I got you in such a mess."" On the forthcoming single Scarlett, she captures the messy imperfection of a teenage friendship in one line: ""We go together / Like bad British weather / On the one day I made plans."" Born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, she was encouraged to be creative by her parents - both doctors - who banned TV in the house so she would make up songs from poetry books. While she was still at school, she uploaded songs to her local BBC Introducing show, and made her radio debut a week later. That led to an appearance at Glastonbury, where she was spotted by Lewis Capaldi - who invited her on tour at the start of 2020. Although Covid ruined her plans for the rest of the year, she's amassed more than 65 million streams for her debut EP, and has just come second on the BBC's Sound Of 2021 - which aims to predict the most exciting new music for the coming year. She talked to BBC News about her early ""crap"" songs, finding her sound and living in a haunted house. The top five so far: Congratulations on making the BBC Sound of 2021 list. After a year of being stuck at home, does any of this feel real? Not really, no. So far, my whole career feels like it has been over social media. I've never done a headline show or anything like that, so I'm really looking forward to being able to play live again in a few months. Just before lockdown, you supported Lewis Capaldi at Wembley. What was that like? I didn't expect to be doing Wembley. I was booked for the Europe leg of the tour - and I was terrified because I'd gone from playing to 200 people to 12,000 in the space of a month or two. Wembley happened when the American support act couldn't come over because of Covid. I was like, ""Fine. If you're forcing me, I'll do it!"" ""But I'll need a bigger dressing room and 10 puppies."" Yeah. And I want bottles of champagne and stuff like that! But it was so cool: Doing a tour like that made me realise just how badly I wanted that for myself. And then, of course, Covid struck... How did you spend the rest of 2020? It was really hard at first. There's nothing inspiring about being stuck inside. And I put a lot of pressure on myself, because everyone else was like, ""Oh brilliant, loads of time to write, we're going to come out with so much stuff at the end of lockdown"". But after a few weeks I was like, ""Okay, I've just got to chill and use the time to my advantage"". And I've actually had loads of fun writing on my own and not having too many people tell me what to do! You moved back in with your parents and sisters. How did that go - because when I was 20, going home was wonderful for about two weeks and then I'd be like, ""would you all just leave me alone."" Oh my gosh, definitely. At the start it was like that. I've got a big family, with lots of strong opinions - there's four girls and we're all really close in age and there's lots of stubbornness. But actually, because the world was in a state of crisis, it ended up being a really special family time - having my mum's home-cooked meals and sleeping in my own bed. It's pretty nice set-up! So, for people who only know of Grantham as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher - what was it like growing up there? It's a really, really rural part of England. Quite old fashioned and feudal. But I had a really lovely childhood because we're in this really old, freezing cold, falling down house about 20 minutes out of town; and my parents always encouraged us to be creative. My dad's obsessed with poetry, and he used to put little poetry books in front of me - like Leonard Cohen or TS Eliot. I didn't understand anything they were talking about, but I used to make up little songs to them. Then I started off writing kind of crap songs [of my own], and parents were like, ""Oh, this is great, she's doing something creative!"" And somehow I ended up doing my hobby as a job. What were those early crap songs like? They were, like, seven-year-old me writing about boys I fancied at school. I'm always finding the notebooks around the house and they're so cringey. It's hilarious. Your first break came from BBC Introducing in Nottingham. What were your hopes when you submitted your songs? I guess I hoped that this would happen - but I never really thought it would! I went to an all-girls school and it was very focused on languages and science. People didn't think music was a real job - and fair enough, it's rural Lincolnshire, you know? But one of my friends' dads heard my music and he was like, ""You should send this to BBC Introducing"". I'd never heard of it before - but I uploaded some songs in summer 2017 and that same week, [BBC Introducing presenter] Dean Jackson in Nottingham was like, ""Come in for a session!"" I had this, like, big brick keyboard that we spent ages shoving into the lift for my first filmed session. And I've had so much support since then from BBC Introducing in the east Midlands and in Lincolnshire. I'm really grateful for all of it. That was 2017 - but you didn't put out your debut EP 'til last year. So what happened in between? It was a really long process. I knew I could write songs and sing but I didn't really know what my sound was, so I started doing co-writes. I think that process is pretty standard - you go and meet a load of people and a lot of the time they're, like, 40-year-old men. I found that process really hard because I find it difficult to be vulnerable with someone I don't have much in common with. And then I met this guy Rob Milton, who used to be in a band called Dog Is Dead, who I really loved when I was growing up. I remember writing Falling Asleep At The Wheel [with him] and being like, ""Ah, this is the lightbulb moment"". That lyric is such a perfect metaphor for sleepwalking through a relationship. Do you remember how it came to you? I had the first line - ""You never smoked this much before we met"" - and I'd taken it to a few sessions where people were like, ""meh."" But when I took it to Rob, he said, ""That's so good. That's an opening line to something"". I wanted to sing about this relationship I was going through that had lost its spark - and one of the notes I'd written on my phone said ""falling asleep at the wheel"". So that was a really fun time. I love that song. Why do you think so many people have fallen for your lyrics? Being exposed to poetry might have something to do with it - but also, I don't keep a diary, so my songs are my way of working through confusing feelings of growing up and being young. Writing a song clears my head and helps everything make sense. So I think that's maybe why people are connecting with it - because it's just universal stuff I'm going through. Deep End is another song that stands out. Am I right that it was written about one of your sisters, when she was going through a difficult time? Yeah, that's right. I find conversations about mental health really hard, so that song was sort of my way of speaking to my sister and telling her that I don't always understand what she's going through, but I'm always here. It was a bit of a hopeless feeling at the time but I think after writing it, it was a weight off my shoulders - and she really loved it, as well. And then your sisters got to spray you down with hoses in the video... That was so much fun to film because we did it just outside my house. But it was filmed in January and, if you look on YouTube, there's so many comments saying, ""Her pupils are massive, she must be on pills"". And honestly, it's just because I was freezing cold! I was literally at the end of my capacity! Your next single is called Haunted House... is that about your family home? Yeah! Is it really haunted? I think it must be. My best friend Scarlett, her mum has an antique shop and she's really superstitious - and when she came here, she said that there were ghosts around. It makes sense because it's such an old house and people have definitely died here. But they must be nice ghosts because this house is such a big part of my soul. What does a nice ghost do? Looks after you and watches over you, I guess. Do they reshelve all the books in alphabetical order? No. No, they didn't do that. This house is a tip.

"Gravity's Alfonso Cuaron became the first Latin American to win the best director award, adding to the film's six Oscars for technical achievement. Cate Blanchett was named best actress for her portrayal of the heroine in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine. Matthew McConaughey won the best actor Oscar for Dallas Buyers Club. It is the second consecutive year the best director and best picture prize have been awarded to different films. Cuaron praised the ""transformative"" power of film and singled out the film's star Sandra Bullock as ""the soul, the heart of Gravity"". The film - which took five years to complete, and owes much to the technical prowess of British visual effects specialists - also won Oscars for film editing, sound mixing, sound editing, cinematography, visual effects and original score. Steve McQueen, the British director of 12 Years a Slave, dedicated the best picture Oscar to ""all those people who have endured slavery"". ""Everyone deserves not just to survive, but to live,"" he said. ""This is the most important legacy of Solomon Northup."" Based on a true story, it follows the life of a free black man - Northup - who is kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana. Producer Brad Pitt praised ""the indomitable Mr McQueen"" - a Turner Prize-winning artist-turned-director - for ""bringing them all together"" to tell Northup's story. Newcomer Lupita Nyong'o won the best supporting actress award for her film debut as slave worker Patsey. The Kenyan actress paid tribute to her character and thanked her for her ""guidance"". ""It doesn't escape me for one moment that so much joy in my life is thanks to so much pain in someone else's,"" said the star, who turned 31 this weekend. The film won a third Oscar for John Ridley's adapted screenplay. ""All the praise goes to Northup,"" Ridley said. ""These are his words."" In other developments: 'Taught to dream' Spike Jonze collected the best original screenplay for Her. Jonze's first film as sole writer and director stars Joaquin Phoenix as a man who falls in love with a computer operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. As predicted, McConaughey took the best actor prize for his role as Ron Woodroof, a real-life rodeo cowboy who smuggled HIV drugs into the US. The 44-year-old actor, formerly a rom-com regular whose roles centred on his good looks, lost 50lbs (23kg) to play Woodroof in the low-budget indie drama. During his speech, he thanked God ""because that's who I look up to"". ""He's graced my life with opportunities that I know are not of my hand or any other human hand,"" he added. Best actress winner Blanchett paid tribute to her rivals, including Dame Judi Dench - who was not at the ceremony - acknowledging ""the random and subjective"" nature of awards ceremonies. McConaughey's co-star Jared Leto won the first Oscar of the night, picking up best supporting actor for his role as a transgender woman who becomes Woodruff's business partner and unlikely friend. In an emotional speech Leto thanked his mother, who accompanied him to the awards, ""for teaching me to dream"" and dedicated his award to ""those who have ever felt injustice because of who they are, or who you love"". ""This is for the 36 million people out there who have lost the battle to Aids,"" said the 30 Seconds to Mars frontman, whose last film was six years ago. Dallas Buyers Club also picked up a third award for make up and hairstyling - with the transformation of Leto and his co-star, Matthew McConaughey, rumoured to have been achieved on a budget of $250 (£150). Frozen, which recently tipped $1bn (£600m) at the global box office, scored two Oscars. The 3D film about an icy princess and her sister was named best animated feature film, with its song, Let It Go - performed by star Idina Menzel - winning best original song. It is loosely based on The Snow Queen by Hans Christian Andersen. The Great Gatsby also picked up two Oscars, for costume design and production design. The awards were picked up by Baz Luhrmann's partner Catherine Martin. But there were no awards for David O Russell's American Hustle, which had 10 nominations, including nods in all the acting categories. Nor were there any awards for Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. The first British win of the night came for Tim Webber and his team from London-based company Framestore for their visual effects work on Gravity. Webber paid tribute to his team, Gravity actors George Clooney and Bullock and director Cuaron ""for having the vision to create this breath-taking film and the audacity to make it happen"". The second British win of the night went to director Malcolm Clarke, who won an Oscar for his documentary short The Lady in Number Six: Music Saved My Life. The film follows Alice Herz-Sommer, the oldest known survivor of the Nazi Holocaust and an accomplished pianist. Paying tribute to Herz-Sommer, who died last week at the age of 110, Clarke praised ""her extraordinary capacity for joy and amazing capacity for forgiveness"". ""She taught everyone on my crew to be a little bit more optimistic,"" he added, dedicating his award to her. Ellen DeGeneres hosted the ceremony, for the second time, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood.","Historical drama 12 Years a Slave has won best picture at the 86th Academy Awards, while space drama Gravity won the lion's share of awards."
"The data shows the 61-year-old reaching a record high of 7.72 million in the first three months of 2012 - up almost 400,000 on the same period of 2011. ""Obviously I'm a late developer,"" joked the broadcaster, who joined Radio 2 30 years ago, adding he was ""delighted"". Overall, though, fewer people are listening to BBC radio stations than at this time last year. The total number of people tuning into the corporation's network radio output in the first three months of 2012 was down 2.2% on the same period in 2011. The most pronounced decline was felt by BBC Radio 3, whose listening figures have dropped 15.8% over the last 12 months. The fall follows several years of BBC stations improving their audience share at their commercial rivals' expense. Radio 1 has seen its listenership fall by 5.8%, while Radio 4 recorded a 4.8% drop-off in its overall audience compared with this time a year ago. Radio 2 - whose breakfast show, hosted by Chris Evans, remains the nation's favourite morning listen - saw its overall audience rise, though only by 0.2%. Bruce was not the only DJ at the station to record record figures, however. Reason to celebrate After 22 years on the air, Brian Matthew's show Sounds Of The 60s achieved its best-ever audience, too - with 3.7 million people tuning in on Saturday mornings. There was more heartening news for the BBC's local stations, which saw their weekly reach increase by 263,000 listeners on the previous quarter. People are also listening to the BBC's regional output longer. The average hours listened per listener per week is now 10 and a half, compared to nine hours and 12 minutes one year ago. And digital station 6 Music posted record listening figures, just two days after it was named UK Station of the Year at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. Rajar figures showed it reached 1.45 million people every week, up from 1.3m last year and 1.44m last quarter. 6 Music was saved from closure in 2010 after a campaign by its listeners. Audience numbers for commercial radio stations remain relatively stable, with only a 0.3% drop-off on this time last year. But the Absolute Radio network has particular reason to celebrate, having increased its reach by more than half a million listeners over the last 12 months. Rajar's figures show that internet radio listening is now at an all-time high, with 42 million hours being consumed each week online. The share of all radio listening via a digital platform now stands at 29.2%, compared with 26.5% for the corresponding period last year.","Radio 2 DJ Ken Bruce has pulled in the biggest audience of his career, according to new figures from Rajar."
"Warner Bros recently halted production on The Maccabees, which Gibson was due to direct, saying Eszterhas' script lacked ""a sense of triumph"". In a letter to Gibson, the writer said, ""the reason you won't make [it] is the ugliest possible one. You hate Jews"". The actor has called the accusations ""utter fabrications"". Gibson's reputation has plunged since his arrest for drink-driving in 2006, during which he made anti-Semitic comments to the arresting police officer. He later apologised for his comments, which he blamed on alcoholism. Eszterhas nine-page, expletive-filled letter was published by film industry website The Wrap . In it, he accused Gibson of never having any intention to make the film. ""I believe you announced the project with great fanfare - 'a Jewish Braveheart' - in an attempt to deflect continuing charges of anti-Semitism which have dogged you, charges which have crippled your career,"" he wrote. 'Substandard first draft' He also accused the actor of using offensive terms including ""hebes"", ""oven-dodgers"" and ""Jewboys"" to describe Jewish people during their time working together. Eszterhas - who is best known for writing Basic Instinct - added, ""I became increasingly worried that I'd made a grave mistake hooking up with you"". ""I felt trapped. This was a project initiated by you. I couldn't legally or morally take it from you. ""I was hoping that the power of the story would overcome your anti-semitic prejudices."" Gibson responded to the allegations in his own letter , saying: ""I would have thought that a man of principle, as you purport to be, would have withdrawn from the project regardless of the money if you truly believed me to be the person you describe in your letter."" ""I guess you only had a problem with me after Warner Brothers rejected your script."" The actor added he still wanted to make the movie, just not based on Eszterhas' script. ""Both Warner Brothers and I were extraordinarily disappointed with the draft,"" he said. ""In 25 years of script development I have never seen a more substandard first draft or a more significant waste of time. The decision not to proceed with you was based on the quality of your script, not on any other factor."" The Maccabees was intended as a drama based on Judah Maccabee, widely revered as one of the greatest warriors in Jewish history. He led the victory of the Maccabee Jews over the Syrian Greeks in 161BC. The success of the revolt is celebrated today by the Hanukkah festival.","Hollywood screenwriter Joe Eszterhas has accused Mel Gibson of shelving a movie about Jewish hero Judah Maccabee because he ""hates Jews""."
"And Tango Makes Three came third in a list of titles the American Library Association said had received the most complaints from parents and educators. The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian came top of the list. Sherman Alexie's tale of a young Native American at a predominantly white high school was first published in 2007. 'Real-life story' Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis, a graphic novel about a young Iranian girl growing up in the years after the country's Islamic Revolution, is ranked second. The list of titles, all of which have been the subject of a formal written complaint, filed with a library or school, requesting they be removed, is compiled annually by the ALA's Office for Intellectual Freedom. The alleged ""cultural insensitivity"" of Alexie's novel is one of the reasons cited in complaints calling for its removal. And Tango Makes Three - based on a real-life story of two male penguins who hatched an egg at the New York Zoo - is accused of promoting a homosexual agenda. Other titles on the list include Toni Morrison's debut novel The Bluest Eye, The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini and A Stolen Life, a kidnapping memoir by Jaycee Dugard. The ALA counted 311 challenges in 2014, roughly the same as were lodged in 2013.",A picture book about two male penguins raising a baby penguin has again made a list of books to have received the most complaints from library users.

"Union, who left in 2019, claimed there was a toxic work environment on the show and alleged she was sacked for speaking out against racism and sexism. She also complained about fellow judge Simon Cowell allegedly smoking on set. In a joint statement, representatives for Union and NBC said she had raised ""important concerns"". NBC Entertainment, the statement continued, ""remains committed to ensuring an inclusive and supportive working environment where people of all backgrounds can be treated with respect."" Union appeared in such films as Bring It On and Bad Boys II and can currently be seen in LA's Finest, a TV spin-off from the Bad Boys franchise. After leaving America's Got Talent it was alleged she witnessed ""racist and inappropriate behaviour"", was labelled as ""difficult"" and was ""punished for speaking out"". In an interview with Variety, Union said she had been ""literally met with the very definition of a toxic work environment... carried out by the most powerful person on the production"". According to that interview, Union ""hesitantly"" raised the issue of Cowell's smoking with producers but was told that ""effectively nothing was going to change"". Union also alleged she was discriminated against because of her hair and that she had been ""shocked"" by a ""wildly racist"" remark made by guest star Jay Leno about Korean food. ""I've always held him in high regard, but I was not prepared for his joke,"" she said of the former Tonight show host.

"By Mark SavageBBC music reporter On Monday, he wrote: ""Thanks to some bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy [expletives], the whole world is now on hold."" Many interpreted the star's comments as anti-Asian or anti-Chinese, but he was praised by some animal rights groups. ""Apologies to any and all that took offence to my posting yesterday,"" Adams said in a new post on Tuesday. ""No excuse, I just wanted to have a rant about the horrible animal cruelty in these wet markets being the possible source of the virus, and promote veganism."" He added: ""I have love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world."" The singer was due to be performing in London this week, before lockdown measures came into force. 'Irresponsible' After his original comments were published, the Canadian singer was criticised by Amy Go, president of the Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice. ""This is so irresponsible and just so, so, so, so racist,"" she told CBC News. ""People look up to public figures. He is seen as an idol by many."" Go suggested Adams' comments would intensify ""racist hatred against Chinese"". Wet markets are a common sight across Asia. They sell live fish, chickens and wildlife, as well as fresh fruit and vegetables, dry goods and household products. Last Friday, the World Health Organisation said one such market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan played a role in the outbreak either as the source or possibly as an ""amplifying setting"", while stressing more research on the link was necessary.

"Fans of the sitcom will finally see what happens between his character John and Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. The episodes - which have already been filmed - will come a year after Kay said the show was coming to an end following its second series. There will be an unscripted episode before the finale, which will reveal if John and Kayleigh have a happy ending. A charity screening of the two episodes is taking place in Blackpool next month before the rest of the UK gets to watch them, a tweet from Peter Kay's account announced on Thursday. It was the first tweet from the account since Kay said in December that he was cancelling his comeback tour - his first tour in eight years - due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"". The event, on 7 April, will raise money for The Lily Foundation, which treats children with mitochondrial disease. In a statement, Kay said of the screening: ""I've had first-hand experience of the foundation's work and I'm proud to raise both awareness and much needed funds to help with the inspiring work they provide to children and their families."" It's not the first time there's been a charity screening of Car Share, with money raised for Comic Relief last March ahead of the launch of the second series. The second series of Car Share ended with Kayleigh declaring her love for John. When he refused to say how he felt, she walked out of his car - and his life. The ending surprised and disappointed many viewers, who were convinced the show, about two employees thrown together in a company car share scheme, was building up to a romantic finish. Kay admitted in November that people had been ""angry"" about how the series had ended. At the time, he described Car Share Unscripted as ""half an hour of us basically making the script up and improvising,"" adding: ""It's nothing to do with the story - just us having a laugh.""

Best actor in a drama went to Daniel Day-Lewis for his role in the biopic Lincoln, while Jessica Chastain won best actress in a drama for Zero Dark Thirty. Earlier, British singer Adele won best song for the theme to the James Bond film Skyfall.

The Golden Globes gives a separate accolade for best film musical or comedy, which was won by Tom Hooper's film of stage hit Les Miserables - the only British film to win an award.

"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter He was perfectly happy with Blur and Gorillaz, or composing operas based on the Chinese pentatonic scale, until XL Records boss Richard Russell intervened. ""He turned round and said, 'I would like to produce you,'"" says Albarn, recalling a conversation that took place after the pair co-produced Bobby Womack's 2012 comeback The Bravest Man in the Universe. ""It was a slightly strange thing to say, considering that our relationship was based on us both being producers together. So there was a moment of, 'Really? Well, blimey. That means I've got to…' ""But I didn't really know what that was going to entail or involve, you know?"" To begin with, Albarn handed over more than 60 songs to Russell - demos and musical fragments he had collected over the years. ""But the funny thing is, we hardly used any of them,"" he says. Instead, the singer jumped on the Central Line, went back to his childhood home in Leytonstone, east London, and hit on a rich seam of inspiration. If you watched BBC Two's Culture Show in February, you may have seen Albarn visiting those same old haunts, going misty-eyed over sweet shops, dustbins and church halls. He also stopped by Hollow Ponds at the top of the Lea Valley, where, as a child, he swam in the open air during the 1976 heatwave. The scene turned into a song, also called Hollow Ponds. It samples the Central Line and contains snapshots of that ""eight year old in swimming trunks"" through his school days to pop stardom and adulthood. It also set the tone for the album, Everyday Robots, a wistful series of reflections from a family man in his 40s. But whatever you do, do not call it nostalgic. ""I don't know if it was nostalgia,"" Albarn protests. ""It was a journey I chose to re-trace, really, and see if I could learn something about myself. ""I found that, not surprisingly, there was an awful lot of stuff. ""The tricky thing was distilling enough of it into song, as opposed to autobiography - which is a very different way of doing the same thing."" ""I thought of it as, how do you take big events and put them into verse?"" The result is his most intimate and revealing album to date. Low-key and textured, it is peppered with domestic detail and a recurring theme of alienation. ""I had a dream you were leaving,"" he sings repeatedly on The Selfish Giant, a sad but familiar story of partners who have lost their spark. ""It's hard to be a lover when the TV's on and there's nothing in your eyes."" By his own admission, the latter lyric was especially hard to record. ""It's quite a strong line,"" he says. ""At the very moment when I was getting ready to do my thing as a singer, I was like, 'Oh, I'm not sure about that.'"" Yet every time he threatened to put up his defences, Russell would coax him into opening up. ""There were moments where I'd go, 'I think that's a bit too close to the knuckle', and that's when Richard would step in and say, 'No, that's a really good line, you've got to keep that.'"" 'A gentle form of sedation' It makes you wonder what discussions they had over You and Me, a song that briefly touches on Albarn's Britpop-era heroin addiction. ""Tinfoil and a lighter,"" he sings. ""Five days on, two days off."" The lyrics prompted a media storm after Albarn, speaking to Q Magazine, described heroin as ""incredibly productive for me"". The singer has since stressed that addiction was ""brutal experience"" and ""nothing that I would recommend"". Clean now for more than a decade, the narcotic that concerns him most on Everyday Robots is technology. The title track documents commuters ""stricken in a state of sleep"" by their phones, while Lonely Press Play frets that the infinite distractions in the palms of our hands allow us to suppress our emotions. ""It's a form of gentle sedation,"" Albarn says. ""I've always opted to have a very old-fashioned phone. There's no internet on my phone. You can't put lots of smiley faces on my phone. It's a very boring, monochrome Nokia. ""But I do have an iPad, which is a very different beast entirely,"" says the singer - who composed parts of the last Gorillaz album, Plastic Beach, using the tablet device. ""I love it because I can be creative with it,"" he says. ""That's the key."" ""When we're doing something creative, technology seems benign. But when we're doing nothing with it - and it seems to be doing a lot more with us - that's when it starts to become terrifying."" Appropriately, electronics are kept to a minimum on Everyday Robots. The record is largely piano-led, pushing Albarn's voice to the foreground, and coloured with ambient sounds, trickling beats and exotic string arrangements. The only time the record sheds its air of melancholy is on the jaunty Mr Tembo, written for an orphaned elephant Albarn met in Mkomazi, Tanzania. (The elephant responded by defecating, he says.) It is the only song to survive from the original 60 demos he gave to Richard Russell, with an ebullient melody brought to life by The Pentecostal City Mission Church Choir, from Albarn's childhood church in Leytonstone. ""I love gospel music,"" the singer says. ""I've loved it all my life. Whether it was listening to my parents' Mahalia Jackson albums or standing outside the London City Mission Church on a Sunday. ""I love all forms of religious music. It's the music I choose to listen to if I'm listening privately to music. Anything from Georgian orthodox choir music to Moroccan Sufi trance music to South Korean shamanistic music. ""You name it - if it is fit for the purpose of a spiritual connection, I love it."" Spirituality is exactly what Albarn hopes to achieve with Everyday Robots. His desire is that listeners will feel a personal connection to the lyrics, in a way they never could with the ""Oi!"" of Parklife. ""That's what can happen if you do something that is completely of yourself,"" he reckons. ""People find things in that because, at the end of the day, our experiences aren't really that different, are they?"" Everyday Robots is out now on Parlophone/XL Records.",Damon Albarn never intended to make a solo album.
"The star's single, Someone Like You, has now been number one for three weeks, whilst her second album, 21, has held the top spot for six weeks. She held off competition from Jessie J and Liam Gallagher's new band Beady Eye in the album chart. Clare MaGuire and Alexis Jordan also had new albums in this week's top 10. Adele recently became the first living artist since The Beatles to have two top five hits in both charts simultaneously. This week her debut album 19 slipped two places to number four, while her other single Rolling in the Deep fell one place to number five. She has a third single in the top 40 - a cover of Bob Dylan's Make You Feel My Love - which is now at number 27, having fallen two places. This year's critic's choice Brit Award winner Jessie J was at number two in both charts.

"UK venues have been shut for four weeks, with all West End performances cancelled until at least 31 May. In several months' time, ""all of the reserves will have dried up and there will be no money left"", Graham warned. ""I don't even know if there will be a theatre or film industry that we can recognise when this is all over."" Graham, one of the country's leading dramatists, has turned his hit West End play Quiz, about the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? coughing scandal, into an ITV mini-series. 'No middle ground' While some theatres have started streaming online, he told the PA news agency it was ""a collective artform"". He explained: ""You need people around you to see it and do it and there is no middle ground now. ""If it's going to survive in any form it will need an aggressive government bailout and you either do or you don't do it. There is either theatre or there isn't any more. ""So there is kind of a clarity to what we need to ask government to do for it to survive and hopefully they will do it."" Graham's stage credits also include This House, Ink and Labour of Love, and he penned the TV dramas Brexit: The Uncivil War and Coalition. ""I am already exhausted about the scale of the fight ahead because every industry, every small business, are all in the same situation and it's obviously very upsetting,"" he said. ""But because the theatres were the first to close... probably, because of the very nature of what they are, gathering people together in close proximity, they will be close to being the last buildings to reopen."" Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber recently said he does not expect theatres to reopen until the end of September. Graham continued: ""I am worried that to have the political argument to justify that level of arts investment again at a time when the economy will be devastated, that's difficult. ""I'm worried for what kind of work, what kind of artists, what kind of people, in a more dangerous climate, will be allowed to make the work. ""I think the default naturally goes to safety, rather than invention. I say this as a playwright who comes from a working-class background - working-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces."" 'Considering further action' A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We are committed to supporting our theatres during this national emergency with help available through the government's unprecedented financial package for business, workers and the self-employed. ""We are in regular contact with the arts and culture sector as we work on our ongoing coronavirus response which includes considering further action that may be necessary.""

"She was speaking at the London Critics' Circle film awards on Sunday, where she received a special award for excellence in film. Here is a transcript of her comments, which she made after a few initial words of thanks. ""It almost feels uncomfortable to receive an award at such a time. But being up here does give me the opportunity to say some things that matter to me. There are directors, producers and men of power who have for decades been awarded and applauded for their highly regarded work by both this industry and moviegoers alike. Indeed, many actors have had flourishing careers, due in part to roles played in their films. The message we received for years was that it was the highest compliment to be offered roles by these men. ""As women around the world and from all walks of life marched last weekend, once again joining together to speak out against harassment, exploitation and abuse, I realised that I wouldn't be able to stand here this evening and keep to myself some bitter regrets that I have about poor decisions to work with individuals with whom I wish I had not. ""It has become clear to me that by not saying anything, I might be adding to the anguish of many courageous women and men. Sexual abuse is a crime. While it rests with the rule of law to pass judgement, it lies with all of us to listen to the smallest of voices and to never stop listening. Also those who do have a voice are becoming afraid to say anything, because of intense scrutiny and criticism. ""Nobody should be exempt from having a right to speak in support of vulnerable people. There are those who can speak so powerfully for those who are not able to do so themselves, and let us please not make this about which people express public regret and those who choose not to, but instead keep the focus on the terrible, secret crimes of abuse against vulnerable children, girls, women and indeed boys and men too. ""The real headline here is that a Hollywood commission on sexual harassment and advancing equality in the workplace now exists, led by Kathy Kennedy. The Time's Up movement that will enable anyone to get professional support to fight back against predators and all forms of abuse and to address the complex problems of inequality and abuse of power in the workplace also now exists. I know we all stand together in hoping that this moment in history paves the way for a transformed future for generation upon generation upon generation to come. ""I think again of the Women's Marches. There was one banner scrawled on cardboard that particularly resonated with me. 'The older I get the more I see women described as having gone mad. What they've actually become is knowledgeable and powerful and [expletive] furious.' Years ago that woman would likely have been locked away. How times have changed. Let's keep them changing.

""I've been in this game for a long time and had nothing, so winning this has been a strange feeling for me."" He added: ""I grew up watching this [EastEnders], so to join it after it had lost its way for a while ... I feel like the new signing in a football team.""

"The flame will arrive in Albert Square on 23 July 2012 for some brief live footage during the show on BBC One. It will be carried by long-standing character Billy Mitchell, played by Perry Fenwick. The torch will pass through 1,018 communities across the UK, it was announced last week. London Games organisers Locog revealed that the torch will pass some of the soap's iconic landmarks including the market, the launderette and The Queen Vic pub. The relay runs from 19 May to 27 July 2012, with the torch travelling about 8,000 miles, culminating in the lighting of the cauldron at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford at the Games' opening ceremony. Along the way it will also fly by zip wire from the Tyne Bridge, cross Loch Ness and visit landmarks including the Giant's Causeway and Stonehenge. EastEnders viewers have already seen characters Fat Boy and Billy Mitchell discover they have been nominated as torchbearers. In Tuesday night's episode, regulars in The Queen Vic will find out that the torch will be passing through Walford. But it is not until December that Billy will discover he has been chosen to carry it. The episode next year will see live footage of Billy being cheered on by the residents of Walford as he carries the flame. Although much of it will be filmed in advance, several minutes of the Olympic procession will be broadcast live from the Elstree set. Sebastian Coe, Chair of Locog, said: ""Today's announcement is a great addition to the Olympic Torch Relay Route. I'm sure the people of Walford will now start planning their celebrations to welcome the flame to Albert Square. ""Along with people right round the UK, the residents of Albert Square will be getting involved to make this their moment to shine."" Fenwick added: ""When we first discussed the storyline, my initial thought was that I'll now have to get fit! ""While this may be a fictional one-off for Billy Mitchell, it's a real once in a lifetime opportunity for me and I am thrilled that Walford and Albert Square will be part of this amazing event."" The name Walford is a mixture of the place names Walthamstow and Stratford. Tony Holland, one of the creators of the series, was born in Walthamstow in east London, and Walford is also the name of a street in nearby Dalston, where Holland lived. This not the first time the Olympics and EastEnders have crossed paths. The Olympic Park is to get the same postcode as the soap, the Royal Mail revealed in March. The site, in Stratford, will receive an E20 code - which is currently used by Walford in the long-running series. Locog said last week the torch will come within 10 miles of 95% of the population. It will go through every English county and every local authority area in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. People nominated to carry the torch will be contacted with a conditional offer in December and the final 8,000 places will be confirmed from February. Torchbearers were nominated for their contribution to the local community.","The fictional London borough of Walford, the home of EastEnders, is to be a location on the 2012 Olympic Torch Relay route."

"By Kev GeogheganArts and Entertainment reporter Formed around the long term-friendship of singer and guitarist Hadyn Park-Patterson and singer and bassist Millie Kidd, The Ninth Wave's sudden rise has seen them support fellow Glaswegians Chvrches at a massive homecoming gig and will also see them go on tour with The Blinders and Brighton band Yonaka later this spring. Kidd and Park-Patterson share both song-writing and lead vocals in part one of their soon to be released two-part album, Infancy. Kidd joined the band two years ago after being contacted, out of the blue, by childhood friend Park-Patterson. The catch, was that she would have to learn a new instrument. ""We've known each other since I was little, we used play at family get-togethers,"" explains Kidd. ""And I used to watch the band when they were playing covers of bands like Foster the People. Two years ago, Hadyn asked me to join because he thought I could play guitar - which I can't. ""He was like 'Oh, but you own a bass...' Which I also didn't know how to play, so I learned from scratch. ""I play drums and keyboard, so I think he just presumed I could play. But if you can play the piano, you can pick things up quickly."" Park-Patterson takes up the story, on the phone from his day job at a coffee shop in his native Barrhead, explaining Kidd's first ever show was at the famed King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow, considered a rites of passage for many Scottish bands. It was also the place where a young Alan McGee signed the fledging Oasis. ""We needed someone in the band,"" he says, ""and I'd known Millie for a long time but we'd lost touch. I knew that she could write songs and I'd liked listening to her stuff. But she was someone who I felt comfortable with and thought we might as well try and she was up for it. ""She said five minutes before we went onstage. 'I've never stood up on a stage before,' because she was a drummer and a piano player so she was always sitting down on stage."" The Ninth Wave's songs touch on feelings of alienation and the pressure to conform and while their blend of 80's infused synth-pop sounds original, there is something familiar about it, sharing a gothic darkness infused in the work of many other Glasgow bands like The Jesus and Mary Chain, Glasvegas, even electronic pop band Chvrches with whom they played at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow. ""I think it's just honesty,"" says Park-Patterson. ""Just reflecting on where you are. Like one of my favourite bands, The Twilight Sad, are very good at doing that sort of thing. For us though it's just about being honest about the stuff in your head. I guess a lot of people feel sad. ""The sound has evolved a lot, I've never really thought of it as a solid thing, it's been fluid in the sense that, like, we've experimented with a lot of different things. The reason why I like to make the music that we do is to match a musical feeling to the thoughts and the lyrics."" The Ninth Wave made their debut at the South By South West Festival last month and Millie remembers the venue owners had to open windows to let some air into the hordes of people who had crowded into the bar to catch their set. ""In some ways it was very overwhelming,"" she said of the experience of playing one of the biggest festivals for new music. ""Like everyone's giving it their all and it makes you work harder, you're like, 'Right, what else can I do to attract attention and stand out even more'. I didn't feel competitive but also, we're all in it for the same thing."" The Ninth Wave were one of several Glasgow bands - like Lucia and Rascalton - to gravitate towards each other at the event in Austin, Texas. Millie says it's indicative of a shared sense of collaboration and support that exists in the city at the moment. ""Glasgow is really amazing for music and there are so many people doing so well and it was so inspiring to see. Like, you're with your pals and you're all smashing it. ""The scene in Glasgow is so nice, because everyone does support everyone, we all go to each other's gigs no matter what. And if you have a contact, you share it with someone else, it's the loveliest scene and I'm not sure it happens in a place like London. Every time we've been there it seems very, very competitive."" Park-Patterson agrees saying the city has always been ""very creative"". The band's collaborators include London-based Glasgow designer Charles Jeffrey - who has helped mould the band's new romantic androgynous look and Edinburgh director Rianne White - who made the band's disturbing video for Half Pure, which sees supermodels literally suffer for their art while the glammed up band sing: You're only half pure / You're only half pure / Where's the pain and the glamour that you were bred for? The Ninth Wave release the first part of their double LP debut the end of this month, with the second half coming in November. The decision to split up the 12 tracks was less a creative one and more informed by the way people consume music, says Park-Patterson. ""The way the world is, listening to music now, everyone gets bored. easily,"" he says. ""We took a year to make the album and then if we put the whole thing out, in maybe a month or so, it's like people expect to hear something else. ""We took a year to make, so it should take a year to put it out, I guess is what we felt."" Infancy: Part 1 is released on Distiller Records on 26 April with Part II due on 15 November.","Continuing the Newbie Tuesday strand - first featured in BBC Music News LIVE - which aims to shine a light on the best new music from the UK and beyond.

"By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter At the same time, access to music in independent schools has risen by 7%, according to figures from the BPI. The gap widens amongst poorer pupils, with just one in four schools in deprived areas offering music lessons. ""You can't imagine how distressing that is to hear,"" said Chi-chi Nwanoku, founder of Chineke, the UK's first majority-BAME orchestra. ""But it's not news to me - because I know that music and the art subjects are being systematically stripped out of all of our schools - and that always hits the kids who go to the free schools."" The BPI surveyed more than 2,000 teachers in England for its report. One in five primary school teachers reported there was no regular music lesson for their class, and only 12% of schools in deprived areas have an orchestra, compared with 85% of independent schools. The figures reflect similar studies in Scotland and Wales. BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor said he was ""profoundly concerned"" by the division between state and independent schools, and called on the government to intervene. ""This inequality is not just deeply unfair to children in the state sector, it risks depriving our culture of future talents as diverse as Adele, Stormzy and Sheku Kanneh-Mason,"" he added. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Arts education programmes receive more money than any subject other than PE - nearly half a billion pounds to fund a range of music and cultural programmes between 2016 and 2020. ""This money is in addition to the funding that schools receive to deliver the curriculum."" They added the department will be working with music groups and practitioners ""to refresh the national plan for music education"" to ""develop a high-quality model music curriculum, which the British Phonographic Industry welcomes"". Speaking at the Global Awards in London on Thursday, saxophonist Jess Gillam said the situation had reached ""a crisis point"". ""It's about so much more than learning an instrument,"" she added. ""It's scientifically proven it helps academic results and it helps children socially. We need to do everything we can to make sure children have that."" Violinist Nicola Benedetti said educators and the music industry were ""all agreed"" that provision was decreasing, but argued the response needed ""more co-ordination"". ""Inevitably if government funds go down, then private institutions need to step up,"" she said. ""Where the money comes from is not as important to me as the money going towards quality work. Those of us who go into schools and work with children need to co-operate with those of us who are CEOs and in positions of power."" 'Opening eyes and ears' In the meantime, many classical musicians are striving to reach young audiences in new ways. Chineke recently announced a concert at the Royal Albert Hall with techno pioneer Carl Craig, and are in the process of recording new orchestral arrangements for a Bob Marley compilation album. ""We're getting used to doing this kind of thing,"" Nwanoku told the BBC. ""It's opening everyone's eyes and ears and taking us out of our confined genre."" Soprano Joanna Forest is taking her music directly to pupils - performing workshops in primary schools to promote her new album. Called The Rhythm of Life, it's a concept record about a day in the life of a typical child, featuring orchestral versions of Take That's Greatest Day and Clare de Lune, and a guest appearance from CBeebies presenter Andy Day. ""It's so important for children to get the opportunity to experience as much music as possible, from all genres,"" she said. The singer spent Thursday morning performing at a school in London's Queen's Park - calling the pupils ""my perfect audience"". ""They were so engaged. There was a lot of movement and clapping out rhythms; and they joined in the singing with me. ""All types of music can be beneficial for children, even if they're not particularly musical. It can be calming, or it can fire their imagination."" The BBC has also been actively assisting schools by providing music lesson plans, videos and support material through its Ten Pieces project - which familiarises pupils with 10 new classical works throughout the year, culminating in a concert at the Proms. Music can 'give you confidence' Launching this year's selection on Monday, director general Tony Hall spoke of the importance of music education. ""I know how much music can change your life. It changed mine. It could change yours, too, because music can make you look at the day differently; it can give you confidence you never knew you had and it can inspire you. ""Perhaps you'll just pick up an instrument for the first time; listen to some music you haven't yet come across; or think about how you can use the talents you have."" BBC Radio 3 is also seeking to broaden its appeal by hiring new, younger presenters, including Jess Gillam; while on Monday, Scala Radio launched with the aim of bringing classical music to a younger crossover audience. Amongst its presenters are Simon Mayo, Anthea Turner and pianist Alexis Ffrench, who argues children are more familiar with orchestral music than they think. ""They might not know the composers, but they know the music through video games, through cinema, and through adverts,"" he said Video games in particular give fans ""an appreciation for the epic power and landscape of orchestral music,"" he said. Many ensembles, including the London Symphony Orchestra, are staging concerts of music from games like Final Fantasy, The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros - often in venues more commonly associated with rock music. ""The orchestras have to survive, and they have to make sure there's an audience that's interested in them,"" explained Thomas Böcker, who staged Europe's first video game concert in 2003. He said audiences at these shows were ""very enthusiastic"" and ""more attentive"" than typical classical music fans. ""It's very quiet during the performances - everybody wants to get every detail out of the performance - but once the pieces are played, then you have a reaction like you would expect from a rock concert,"" he said. But while classical musicians are making renewed efforts to attract young audiences, Nwanoku warned that the disappearance of music from the classroom could have long-term impact. ""The knock-on effect is pushing culture and community even further apart from each other,"" she said. ""Music is a combined effort. It's not interesting just to play for yourself. ""The orchestra, the artists, the audience, we're all in it together [and] a community without culture is dying."" Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Lead singer Diana Ross tweeted: ""My condolences to Mary's family, I am reminded that each day is a gift, I have so many wonderful memories of our time together. The Supremes will live on, in our hearts 💕."" The founder of Motown Records, Berry Gordy, said in a statement: ""I was extremely shocked and saddened to hear of the passing of a major member of the Motown family, Mary Wilson of the Supremes. ""The Supremes opened doors for themselves, the other Motown acts, and many, many others... I was always proud of Mary. She was quite a star in her own right and over the years continued to work hard to boost the legacy of the Supremes. Mary Wilson was extremely special to me. She was a trailblazer, a diva and will be deeply missed."" Vocalist Patti LaBelle, who rose to fame alongside Wilson in the 60s, added: ""I am deeply saddened by the passing of the beautiful Mary Wilson! She was a legend and an icon and what she contributed to the world cannot be overstated. I send my deepest condolences and prayers to her family, loved ones and fans❤."" Academy award-winning actress Viola Davis posted: ""RIP Mary Wilson! Godspeed 💛."" Singer Beverley Knight said: ""Mary Wilson along with Florence Ballard and Diana Ross changed the game permanently. Hit after hit after hit, on regular rotation to this day. A Supreme Titan may have left us but that legacy will never be surpassed."" In recognition of her ground-breaking influence with the group, the foundation of late civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King tweeted in tribute. A funeral for Wilson will be held privately due to Covid-19 restrictions, her family said, but a celebration of her life will take place later this year. Wilson was an original member of the group alongside Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Barbara Martin. Martin left the group before they became successful, and The Supremes continued as a trio. The Supremes became Motown's most successful act of the 1960s scoring 12 number one singles in the US. Their first number one was 1964's Where Did Our Love Go, which was soon followed by Baby Love, Come See About Me and Stop! In the Name of Love. Baby Love was the only single to reach number one in the UK, but several of their singles hit the top 10 including You Keep Me Hangin' On and You Can't Hurry Love. In 1967, Ballard was replaced by Cindy Birdsong and Gordy renamed the group Diana Ross and the Supremes. Three years later, Ross left to pursue a solo career. After her departure, Wilson was left as the only original member of the group. Wilson continued performing with Cindy Birdsong and Jean Terrell as the ""new"" Supremes, better known today as the ""70s Supremes"". The group disbanded following Wilson's 1977 departure. Wilson became a New York Times bestselling author in 1986 with the release of her autobiography, Dreamgirl: My Life As a Supreme. The Supremes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Interest in the group's legacy was renewed after the release of the film Dreamgirls in 2006, which starred Beyoncé Knowles and Jennifer Hudson. The movie was based on the story of The Supremes, although Wilson said it did not depict their true story. In 2019, Wilson took part in Dancing With The Stars, the US version of Strictly Come Dancing. Just two days before her death, Wilson uploaded a video on YouTube announcing that she was working on releasing new solo material. Paul Stanley of Kiss tweeted: ""I was just on a Zoom call with her Wednesday for about an hour and never could have imagined this. So full of life and great stories. Absolutely shocked. Rest In Supreme Peace Mary."" Broadcaster Tony Blackburn said: ""So sorry to hear the wonderful Mary Wilson has passed away. She was a very great singer and a very nice person. R.I.P.""

"It's 10 years since JK Rowling revealed that Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore was gay in a Q&A with fans. It confirmed speculation that had been around on fan sites for years - all that was known before that was that he had a mysterious, troubled past. Rowling also revealed that when he was young, Dumbledore had been smitten with rival Gellert Grindelwald, who he beat in a duel. Dumbledore was ""horribly, terribly let down"" she said, and his love for Grindelwald was his ""great tragedy"". We already know Johnny Depp will play Grindelwald in the movie, so many fans are hoping to see Depp and Law in an on-screen romance. Some LGBT fans were upset that JK Rowling didn't mention in any of the books that Dumbledore was gay and saw it as an ""afterthought"". In a blog post on the Harry Potter fan site Mugglenet.com, Elayna Mae Darcy says the upcoming Fantastic Beasts film is a chance to put that right. ""One has to have hope that she will use this opportunity to show us the side of Dumbledore we could never have seen when he was a much older man who had long before been tragically let down by the man he loved,"" she writes. ""We have the chance to witness, in real time, a Dumbledore who is young and vivacious and who, hopefully, both acknowledges his sexuality and gives us a chance to see a well-rounded gay character in a mainstream blockbuster."" She says the Harry Potter author has a responsibility to show the relationship. ""Representation can change people's lives and make them feel seen... Kids growing up right now have a chance to experience one of the most important characters in the entire saga as someone who's confident with who he is."" And she is backed by other fans, who do not want to see Dumbledore's sexuality glossed over. Speaking last year about the second Fantastic Beasts movie, Rowling said we will see Dumbledore as a younger and ""quite troubled man"". ""We'll see him at that formative period of his life. As far as his sexuality is concerned, watch this space,"" she said. But Debbie Moon, Bafta-winning writer of the fantasy series Wolfblood, isn't convinced we'll see any romance on screen. ""Chances on Young Dumbledore appearing even remotely gay in a major studio tentpole? I'll take 0%...""she tweeted. And some fans have pointed out that any gay storyline may cause problems for the film's distribution worldwide. The live action Beauty and the Beast, which featured the first openly gay character in a Disney film, was recently pulled from Kuwait cinemas and faced issues in Malaysia, where homosexual activity is illegal. Russia's Culture Ministry allowed the release of Beauty and the Beast - but children under the age of 16 are not allowed to see it. It was given a 16+ age rating after a Russian MP petitioned Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky to ban it because of the inclusion of a gay character. When pressed on Dumbledore being gay in the second film, Rowling pointed out that is only the second film in a series. ""I would like to say because this is obviously a five-part story, there's lots to unpack in that relationship."" So fans may have to wait to watch the love story and ultimate betrayal unfold.

"By Vincent DowdArts reporter, BBC News David Kross is 28. As a teenager in Germany, his first big film was Knallhart (aka Tough Enough). Then in 2008 his role in The Reader, opposite Kate Winslet, brought international fame. But as a child, what he really wanted to be was a professional football player. ""I always loved the game,"" he says. ""From five years old until I was 15, I was totally sure I'd be a footballer. It was the same with most of my friends but for me, it didn't work out. So I became an actor."" In The Keeper, he's been called upon to revive his skills on the pitch. It's the true story of Bernd Trautmann, born in 1923, who was in the German forces in World War Two. In 1944 Trautmann was captured by British troops and ultimately sent to a prisoner of war camp near Wigan. Somewhere along the way, the name Bernd became Bert. His talent as a goalkeeper registered and he ended up playing for local side St Helens Town in the old Lancashire Combination League. In 1949 he moved to Manchester City as a professional and stayed until 1964, turning out for the club more than 500 times. He died in 2013. The film is a German-British co-production and in Germany it's simply called Trautmann. But director Marcus Rosenmüller admits that few Germans under 65 would know who the central character is. ""But that's not a big problem because the story really has to work as a love story and a family drama. It's not just a sports bio-pic, although of course the football scenes have to be convincing."" A lot of the hard work of giving the story emotional depth rests with Freya Mavor, who made her name playing Mini McGuinness in the final seasons of Skins on E4. She plays Trautmann's first wife Margaret. Mavor can't claim to compete with her co-star's passion for football but says: ""I've lived quite a lot in France, so when France won the World Cup last summer, I did go a bit mad."" From the ages of nine to 13 Mavor lived in La Rochelle on France's Atlantic coast; at 19 she moved to Paris. Her fluency in the language means she's been in several French films. ""I've always loved French cinema and I was obsessed with not sounding like a tourist. So it's brilliant to be accepted as an honorary French person in film."" But was it hard to produce a convincing accent for post-war industrial Lancashire? ""The big test was to sound authentic for people in St Helens and Manchester now,"" Mavor says. ""But I also wanted to understand the society which Margaret came from historically. There's a fascinating book by Norman Longmate called How We Lived Then. It was a huge help in understanding what the war was like for most people."" At this point Kross confesses that, though much of the film is set there, he never actually went to St Helens. ""A lot of The Keeper was filmed in Northern Ireland and our football ground was in Belfast. But that's how films work. Later, when you see me at Wembley with Man City, that's mainly CGI: we were actually filming at Augsburg in Bavaria."" It was in the 1956 FA Cup final at Wembley, when Manchester City were playing Birmingham, that Trautmann damaged vertebrae in his neck. Despite being in a fog of pain, Trautmann played on to the end of the match, securing his side's victory. It was only later he realised how severe his injuries were. The film starts with a short but powerful section in which we see Trautmann fighting in World War Two. Kross says those scenes were essential. ""We have to understand the times he grew up in and the criminal regime which dominated Germany. Bert was part of the Hitler Youth and he went through a sort of brainwashing. ""He absolutely wanted to be a soldier. But there are interviews Bert did near the end of his life in which he talks about seeing civilians shot in Ukraine and how that changed him."" Kross says The Keeper is basically about a man seeking a new home. ""I think that's the emotional centre and that's what I needed to get right as an actor."" In the last part of his life, Trautmann lived in Spain and it was there that director Rosenmüller went to talk to him, several years before filming began. ""We spent a week talking to him and as I sat there, I wondered why no one had filmed his story already. There is such drama in how Margaret accepts him and then how his teammates accept him and then England accepts this man they thought was a Nazi."" Rosenmüller always knew there would be a German release for the film but he resisted the temptation to reshoot Kross's scenes in German. ""Visually the German and English versions are 98% the same and David was in the odd position of dubbing himself into his own language. Almost all the German is spoken early on and in fact that helps the drama - the audience sees that Bert is lost in a world he doesn't understand."" Kross comes from Schleswig-Holstein, near the Danish border, but he now lives in Berlin. For a year he was at drama school in London but he's worked in German- and English-language films. So where does he now see the centre of his acting career? ""I would love to do more British-German co-productions. But that doesn't really happen much: it has to be a story which will interest both audiences and the film industry doesn't very often come up with these stories."" The rate of change in that industry is clear when Kross and Mavor talk about what they're doing now. His next project is Betongold (Concrete Gold) - one of the first Netflix productions in Germany. Mavor, meanwhile, has been filming a four-part fantasy in French called Il était une seconde fois (Once Upon Another Time). It, too, is to be seen on Netflix.

The former prisoner of war from Bremen became one of the most acclaimed British goalkeepers of his generation, playing eventually for Manchester City. Now the film The Keeper tells his story."
"By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter The Radio Times conducted a poll to find people's ""ultimate TV schedule"" for its 90th birthday. Almost 30,000 votes were cast - with Blue Peter chosen as the top children's programme and Morecambe and Wise as the best entertainment show. Of the six winners, only Blue Peter and Doctor Who are still on the air, with both running for several decades. The full schedule comprised the following programmes: ""It's a pretty good representation,"" said Boyd Hilton, TV critic from Heat Magazine. ""They're all solid, hugely influential shows."" ""Doctor Who is absolutely unique. It's an incredible achievement that it's lasted for 50 years and been entertaining families for that long."" However, Hilton said he wouldn't have chosen Blue Peter as the best children's show. ""I would have gone for Grange Hill, personally. It was a much bolder thing to commission for children - a drama that tackled lots of incredibly difficult issues."" 'Very safe' Kevin O'Sullivan, TV critic at The Daily Mirror, said it was a ""fascinating insight into the tastes of Middle Britain"". ""What I find interesting is that even people like me, writing for the masses, gather around what you might call cutting-edge programmes like The Inbetweeners instead of, say, My Family. ""And in a way our instincts are wrong in terms of what the public likes."" ""These are all very conventional, very safe, and that is in no way to denigrate them. They're very well-produced, mainstream programmes - and there's your secret."" The poll saw former ITV newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald win almost as many votes as the next four most popular nominees combined, Moira Stuart came second, followed by Kenneth Kendall, Reginald Bosanquet and Fiona Bruce. In the drama category, Downton Abbey, Sherlock and Coronation Street all lost to Doctor Who, which turns 50 this year, and will soon welcome a new Doctor, in the guise of Peter Capaldi. Michael Palin topped the documentary section with his 1989 series, Around The World In 80 Days, in which he tried to recreate Phileas Fogg's fictional jaunt around the world. The programme beat Sir David Attenborough's Life On Earth into second place, while Walking With Dinosaurs came third. Morecambe And Wise won the entertainment vote, followed by another comedy duo, The Two Ronnies, and thereafter Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear and I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here! Surprisingly, there was no place in the list for The X Factor. In the children's programme category, Blue Peter easily outranked Thunderbirds and Wallace and Gromit, earning 17% of the vote. John Sullivan's Only Fools And Horses, which introduced Sir David Jason as wheeler-dealer Derek ""Del Boy"" Trotter, received double the number of votes of its nearest rival, Fawlty Towers. Blackadder, Dad's Army and Father Ted rounded out the top five shows in the comedy category. ""Our poll captured the imagination of our readers,"" said Radio Times editor Ben Preston. ""Everyone had their say,"" he added, ""but am I the only person wondering how Wallace and Gromit and Fawlty Towers didn't win a place in Radio Times Hall of Fame?"" O'Sullivan, meanwhile said the public's choices should send a message to the people who commission shows. ""If you're a TV producer or scheduler, you're always trying to be groovy - casting someone like Alex Zane instead of Bruce Forsyth,"" he said. ""But that won't get you many viewers. Brucie's where it's at.""","Del Boy, Sir Trevor McDonald and Doctor Who are the companions most TV viewers would like to spend an evening with."
"Artists Anthea Hamilton, Michael Dean, Helen Marten and Josephine Pryde are all in the running for the honour. The prestigious prize is awarded to a British artist, under the age of 50, considered to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. Its stated aim is to ""promote public debate around new developments in contemporary art"". The awards ceremony will take place at Tate Britain, and will be broadcast live on the BBC. Hamilton has been included for her work that focuses on fetishism, while sculptor Dean was chosen for pieces made from salvaged materials. Painter and sculptor Marten's art is described as ""slippery and elusive"" and Pryde's work shows a fascination between art and photography. Marten won the first Hepworth Prize for Sculpture recently, and pledged to share the £30,000 award with her fellow nominees. The jury is chaired by Alex Farquharson, director of Tate Britain. Last year's prize was won by design collective Assemble for a regeneration scheme for derelict houses in Liverpool. The ceremony will be broadcast live on the BBC News Channel from 21:30 and BBC World and will be available online later.
